*Ming Yang,Dongrun Li,Xin Wang,Feng Li,Lisheng Fan,Chunxiao Wang,Xiaoming Wu,Peng Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedeCouple is a federated learning method that balances global generalization and local adaptability through joint feature learning, dynamic knowledge distillation, and privacy-preserving anchors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing personalized federated learning methods focus on feature consistency and classification personalization but neglect local extractor adaptability and global classifier generalization, leading to poor component coordination and degraded performance.

Method: Jointly learns global and local feature representations, uses dynamic knowledge distillation for classifier generalization, and introduces local anchors to refine feature space while preserving privacy and reducing communication overhead.

Result: Extensive experiments on five image-classification datasets show FedeCouple consistently outperforms nine baselines in effectiveness, stability, scalability, and security, achieving 4.3% improvement over the best baseline.

Conclusion: FedeCouple effectively addresses the coordination problem in personalized federated learning by balancing global generalization and local adaptability, with proven convergence for nonconvex objectives and superior performance across multiple metrics.

Abstract: In privacy-preserving mobile network transmission scenarios with heterogeneous client data, personalized federated learning methods that decouple feature extractors and classifiers have demonstrated notable advantages in enhancing learning capability. However, many existing approaches primarily focus on feature space consistency and classification personalization during local training, often neglecting the local adaptability of the extractor and the global generalization of the classifier. This oversight results in insufficient coordination and weak coupling between the components, ultimately degrading the overall model performance. To address this challenge, we propose FedeCouple, a federated learning method that balances global generalization and local adaptability at a fine-grained level. Our approach jointly learns global and local feature representations while employing dynamic knowledge distillation to enhance the generalization of personalized classifiers. We further introduce anchors to refine the feature space; their strict locality and non-transmission inherently preserve privacy and reduce communication overhead. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis proving that FedeCouple converges for nonconvex objectives, with iterates approaching a stationary point as the number of communication rounds increases. Extensive experiments conducted on five image-classification datasets demonstrate that FedeCouple consistently outperforms nine baseline methods in effectiveness, stability, scalability, and security. Notably, in experiments evaluating effectiveness, FedeCouple surpasses the best baseline by a significant margin of 4.3%.

*Ye Tian,Ling Yang,Jiongfan Yang,Anran Wang,Yu Tian,Jiani Zheng,Haochen Wang,Zhiyang Teng,Zhuochen Wang,Yinjie Wang,Yunhai Tong,Mengdi Wang,Xiangtai Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMaDA-Parallel addresses error propagation in thinking-aware generation by enabling parallel, bidirectional interaction between text and images throughout denoising, achieving 6.9% improvement in output alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sequential, autoregressive approaches for thinking-aware generation can paradoxically degrade performance due to error propagation, particularly with poor alignment between generated reasoning and final output.

Method: Proposes a parallel multimodal diffusion framework (MMaDA-Parallel) with continuous text-image interaction, trained with supervised finetuning and optimized via Parallel Reinforcement Learning (ParaRL) using semantic rewards for cross-modal consistency.

Result: Achieves 6.9% improvement in Output Alignment on ParaBench benchmark compared to state-of-the-art model Bagel, significantly improving cross-modal alignment and semantic consistency.

Conclusion: Establishes a more robust paradigm for thinking-aware image synthesis by addressing error propagation through parallel multimodal interaction and trajectory-based optimization.

Abstract: While thinking-aware generation aims to improve performance on complex tasks, we identify a critical failure mode where existing sequential, autoregressive approaches can paradoxically degrade performance due to error propagation. To systematically analyze this issue, we propose ParaBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate both text and image output modalities. Our analysis using ParaBench reveals that this performance degradation is strongly correlated with poor alignment between the generated reasoning and the final image. To resolve this, we propose a parallel multimodal diffusion framework, MMaDA-Parallel, that enables continuous, bidirectional interaction between text and images throughout the entire denoising trajectory. MMaDA-Parallel is trained with supervised finetuning and then further optimized by Parallel Reinforcement Learning (ParaRL), a novel strategy that applies semantic rewards along the trajectory to enforce cross-modal consistency. Experiments validate that our model significantly improves cross-modal alignment and semantic consistency, achieving a 6.9\% improvement in Output Alignment on ParaBench compared to the state-of-the-art model, Bagel, establishing a more robust paradigm for thinking-aware image synthesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PriVi is a large-scale primate-centric video dataset used to pretrain V-JEPA, improving generalization and data efficiency for primate behavior analysis across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing computer vision methods for primate behavior analysis rely on human-centric models and single datasets, limiting generalization. There is a need for primate-specific pretraining to improve performance.

Method: Created PriVi dataset (424 hours of curated primate videos), pretrained V-JEPA on it, and evaluated with lightweight frozen classifier across four benchmark datasets.

Result: Outperformed prior work including fully finetuned baselines across all four datasets (ChimpACT, BaboonLand, PanAf500, ChimpBehave), with better scaling using fewer labels.

Conclusion: Primate-centric pretraining substantially improves data efficiency and generalization, making it promising for low-label applications in primate behavior research.

Abstract: Non-human primates are our closest living relatives, and analyzing their behavior is central to research in cognition, evolution, and conservation. Computer vision could greatly aid this research, but existing methods often rely on human-centric pretrained models and focus on single datasets, which limits generalization. We address this limitation by shifting from a model-centric to a data-centric approach and introduce PriVi, a large-scale primate-centric video pretraining dataset. PriVi contains 424 hours of curated video, combining 174 hours from behavioral research across 11 settings with 250 hours of diverse web-sourced footage, assembled through a scalable data curation pipeline. We pretrain V-JEPA on PriVi to learn primate-specific representations and evaluate it using a lightweight frozen classifier. Across four benchmark datasets, ChimpACT, BaboonLand, PanAf500, and ChimpBehave, our approach consistently outperforms prior work, including fully finetuned baselines, and scales favorably with fewer labels. These results demonstrate that primate-centric pretraining substantially improves data efficiency and generalization, making it a promising approach for low-label applications. Code, models, and the majority of the dataset will be made available.

*Katie Matton,Purvaja Balaji,Hamzeh Ghasemzadeh,Jameson C. Cooper,Daryush D. Mehta,Jarrad H. Van Stan,Robert E. Hillman,Rosalind Picard,John Guttag,S. Mazdak Abulnaga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First automated method for classifying phonotrauma severity from vocal fold images using ordinal regression with soft labels to handle annotator uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current phonotrauma severity assessment relies on costly clinician judgment with variable reliability, limiting large-scale studies and consistent patient care.

Method: Proposed soft ordinal regression framework that modifies loss functions to handle soft labels representing annotator rating distributions, accounting for label uncertainty.

Result: Achieved predictive performance approaching clinical experts while producing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates.

Conclusion: Automated phonotrauma severity assessment enables large-scale studies, improving clinical understanding and patient care.

Abstract: Phonotrauma refers to vocal fold tissue damage resulting from exposure to forces during voicing. It occurs on a continuum from mild to severe, and treatment options can vary based on severity. Assessment of severity involves a clinician's expert judgment, which is costly and can vary widely in reliability. In this work, we present the first method for automatically classifying phonotrauma severity from vocal fold images. To account for the ordinal nature of the labels, we adopt a widely used ordinal regression framework. To account for label uncertainty, we propose a novel modification to ordinal regression loss functions that enables them to operate on soft labels reflecting annotator rating distributions. Our proposed soft ordinal regression method achieves predictive performance approaching that of clinical experts, while producing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. By providing an automated tool for phonotrauma severity assessment, our work can enable large-scale studies of phonotrauma, ultimately leading to improved clinical understanding and patient care.

*Arman Zarei,Samyadeep Basu,Mobina Pournemat,Sayan Nag,Ryan Rossi,Soheil Feizi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SliderEdit enables continuous, fine-grained control over individual instructions in multi-instruction image editing by exposing each instruction as an adjustable slider, allowing smooth strength adjustment without requiring separate training for each attribute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current instruction-based image editing models apply each instruction with fixed strength, limiting users' ability to precisely control the intensity of individual edits.

Method: Disentangles individual instructions from multi-part prompts and exposes each as a globally trained slider using a single set of low-rank adaptation matrices that generalize across diverse edits, attributes, and compositional instructions.

Result: Substantial improvements in edit controllability, visual consistency, and user steerability when applied to state-of-the-art models like FLUX-Kontext and Qwen-Image-Edit.

Conclusion: First framework for continuous, fine-grained instruction control in instruction-based image editing, paving the way for interactive, instruction-driven image manipulation with continuous and compositional control.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing models have recently achieved impressive performance, enabling complex edits to an input image from a multi-instruction prompt. However, these models apply each instruction in the prompt with a fixed strength, limiting the user's ability to precisely and continuously control the intensity of individual edits. We introduce SliderEdit, a framework for continuous image editing with fine-grained, interpretable instruction control. Given a multi-part edit instruction, SliderEdit disentangles the individual instructions and exposes each as a globally trained slider, allowing smooth adjustment of its strength. Unlike prior works that introduced slider-based attribute controls in text-to-image generation, typically requiring separate training or fine-tuning for each attribute or concept, our method learns a single set of low-rank adaptation matrices that generalize across diverse edits, attributes, and compositional instructions. This enables continuous interpolation along individual edit dimensions while preserving both spatial locality and global semantic consistency. We apply SliderEdit to state-of-the-art image editing models, including FLUX-Kontext and Qwen-Image-Edit, and observe substantial improvements in edit controllability, visual consistency, and user steerability. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore and propose a framework for continuous, fine-grained instruction control in instruction-based image editing models. Our results pave the way for interactive, instruction-driven image manipulation with continuous and compositional control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address temporal challenges in video-based crowd analysis and provide scalable real-time monitoring for public safety, disaster response, and event management applications.

Method: Integration of denoising probabilistic model with diffusion processes, narrow Gaussian kernels for multiple density maps, regression branch for feature extraction, consolidation mechanism based on similarity scores, and event-driven sampling using Farneback optical flow.

Result: Model effectively captures crowd dynamics in both dense and sparse settings, reduces frame counts while maintaining essential events, and demonstrates improved accuracy through qualitative and quantitative evaluations including MAE metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses video-specific temporal challenges and provides an efficient, scalable solution for real-time crowd monitoring applications.

Abstract: This study enhances a crowd density estimation algorithm originally designed for image-based analysis by adapting it for video-based scenarios. The proposed method integrates a denoising probabilistic model that utilizes diffusion processes to generate high-quality crowd density maps. To improve accuracy, narrow Gaussian kernels are employed, and multiple density map outputs are generated. A regression branch is incorporated into the model for precise feature extraction, while a consolidation mechanism combines these maps based on similarity scores to produce a robust final result. An event-driven sampling technique, utilizing the Farneback optical flow algorithm, is introduced to selectively capture frames showing significant crowd movements, reducing computational load and storage by focusing on critical crowd dynamics. Through qualitative and quantitative evaluations, including overlay plots and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), the model demonstrates its ability to effectively capture crowd dynamics in both dense and sparse settings. The efficiency of the sampling method is further assessed, showcasing its capability to decrease frame counts while maintaining essential crowd events. By addressing the temporal challenges unique to video analysis, this work offers a scalable and efficient framework for real-time crowd monitoring in applications such as public safety, disaster response, and event management.

*Yunqian Cheng,Benjamin Princen,Roberto Manduchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PALMS+ is an image-based indoor localization system that uses monocular depth estimation and geometric layout matching to achieve accurate GPS-free localization without requiring training or infrastructure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-based indoor localization methods like PALMS have limitations including short smartphone LiDAR range and ambiguity in indoor layouts, which need to be addressed for practical applications.

Method: Reconstructs scale-aligned 3D point clouds from posed RGB images using Depth Pro foundation model, then performs geometric layout matching via convolution with floor plans to output location and orientation posteriors.

Result: Outperforms PALMS and F3Loc on Structured3D and custom campus datasets (80 observations across 4 buildings), achieving better stationary localization accuracy without training. When integrated with particle filter for sequential localization on 33 real-world trajectories, achieved lower errors.

Conclusion: PALMS+ demonstrates robust infrastructure-free indoor localization suitable for camera-free tracking applications, with modular design enabling both direct and sequential localization approaches.

Abstract: Indoor localization in GPS-denied environments is crucial for applications like emergency response and assistive navigation. Vision-based methods such as PALMS enable infrastructure-free localization using only a floor plan and a stationary scan, but are limited by the short range of smartphone LiDAR and ambiguity in indoor layouts. We propose PALMS$+$, a modular, image-based system that addresses these challenges by reconstructing scale-aligned 3D point clouds from posed RGB images using a foundation monocular depth estimation model (Depth Pro), followed by geometric layout matching via convolution with the floor plan. PALMS$+$ outputs a posterior over the location and orientation, usable for direct or sequential localization. Evaluated on the Structured3D and a custom campus dataset consisting of 80 observations across four large campus buildings, PALMS$+$ outperforms PALMS and F3Loc in stationary localization accuracy -- without requiring any training. Furthermore, when integrated with a particle filter for sequential localization on 33 real-world trajectories, PALMS$+$ achieved lower localization errors compared to other methods, demonstrating robustness for camera-free tracking and its potential for infrastructure-free applications.

### [8] [Social LSTM with Dynamic Occupancy Modeling for Realistic Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09735)
*Ahmed Alia,Mohcine Chraibi,Armin Seyfried*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel deep learning model enhances Social LSTM with a Dynamic Occupied Space loss function to improve pedestrian trajectory prediction by reducing collisions without increasing displacement error across various crowd densities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most pedestrian trajectory prediction approaches treat pedestrians as point entities, ignoring the physical space each person occupies, which limits realistic collision avoidance in dynamic and crowded environments.

Method: Proposes a model that enhances Social LSTM with a Dynamic Occupied Space loss function combining average displacement error with a collision penalty sensitive to scene density and individual spatial occupancy. Uses five datasets from real pedestrian trajectories with different density settings.

Result: Achieves up to 31% reduction in collision rate and reduces average displacement error and final displacement error by 5% and 6% respectively across all datasets. Consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models across most test sets.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively addresses the limitations of existing approaches by incorporating physical space considerations, resulting in improved collision avoidance and trajectory prediction accuracy across various crowd density scenarios.

Abstract: In dynamic and crowded environments, realistic pedestrian trajectory prediction remains a challenging task due to the complex nature of human motion and the mutual influences among individuals. Deep learning models have recently achieved promising results by implicitly learning such patterns from 2D trajectory data. However, most approaches treat pedestrians as point entities, ignoring the physical space that each person occupies. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel deep learning model that enhances the Social LSTM with a new Dynamic Occupied Space loss function. This loss function guides Social LSTM in learning to avoid realistic collisions without increasing displacement error across different crowd densities, ranging from low to high, in both homogeneous and heterogeneous density settings. Such a function achieves this by combining the average displacement error with a new collision penalty that is sensitive to scene density and individual spatial occupancy. For efficient training and evaluation, five datasets were generated from real pedestrian trajectories recorded during the Festival of Lights in Lyon 2022. Four datasets represent homogeneous crowd conditions -- low, medium, high, and very high density -- while the fifth corresponds to a heterogeneous density distribution. The experimental findings indicate that the proposed model not only lowers collision rates but also enhances displacement prediction accuracy in each dataset. Specifically, the model achieves up to a 31% reduction in the collision rate and reduces the average displacement error and the final displacement error by 5% and 6%, respectively, on average across all datasets compared to the baseline. Moreover, the proposed model consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art deep learning models across most test sets.

Motivation: Soiling detection is crucial for robust advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) to handle external conditions like weather and dust.

Method: Treat soiling detection as semantic segmentation problem, compare popular segmentation methods, create new data subset to fix Woodscape dataset issues.

Result: Segmentation methods show superiority over tile-level classification. New smaller dataset subset provides comparable results in much shorter training time.

Conclusion: Semantic segmentation approach is effective for soiling detection, and the revised dataset addresses original data quality issues while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Soiling detection for automotive cameras is a crucial part of advanced driver assistance systems to make them more robust to external conditions like weather, dust, etc. In this paper, we regard the soiling detection as a semantic segmentation problem. We provide a comprehensive comparison of popular segmentation methods and show their superiority in performance while comparing them to tile-level classification approaches. Moreover, we present an extensive analysis of the Woodscape dataset showing that the original dataset contains a data-leakage and imprecise annotations. To address these problems, we create a new data subset, which, despite being much smaller, provides enough information for the segmentation method to reach comparable results in a much shorter time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Medical foundation models outperform general-domain ones for chest X-ray analysis, but their effectiveness is task-dependent. Medical pre-training provides superior features for classification and segmenting salient anatomy, but all models struggle with subtle pathology segmentation without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how pre-training domain, paradigm, and architecture influence embedding quality for radiology tasks, and to identify optimal encoders for specific chest X-ray analysis applications.

Method: Evaluated vision encoders from eight medical and general-domain foundation models for chest X-ray analysis using linear probing and fine-tuning on classification (pneumothorax, cardiomegaly) and segmentation (pneumothorax, cardiac boundary) tasks.

Result: Medical foundation models consistently outperformed general-domain models in linear probing. Pre-trained embeddings were strong for global classification and segmenting salient anatomy, but performed poorly for segmenting subtle pathologies without significant fine-tuning. Text-image alignment was not necessary for good performance.

Conclusion: Medical pre-training is beneficial but not universally effective, especially for complex localization tasks where supervised models remain competitive. Architectural choices and task-specific requirements are critical factors in model selection.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) promise to generalize medical imaging, but their effectiveness varies. It remains unclear how pre-training domain (medical vs. general), paradigm (e.g., text-guided), and architecture influence embedding quality, hindering the selection of optimal encoders for specific radiology tasks. To address this, we evaluate vision encoders from eight medical and general-domain FMs for chest X-ray analysis. We benchmark classification (pneumothorax, cardiomegaly) and segmentation (pneumothorax, cardiac boundary) using linear probing and fine-tuning. Our results show that domain-specific pre-training provides a significant advantage; medical FMs consistently outperformed general-domain models in linear probing, establishing superior initial feature quality. However, feature utility is highly task-dependent. Pre-trained embeddings were strong for global classification and segmenting salient anatomy (e.g., heart). In contrast, for segmenting complex, subtle pathologies (e.g., pneumothorax), all FMs performed poorly without significant fine-tuning, revealing a critical gap in localizing subtle disease. Subgroup analysis showed FMs use confounding shortcuts (e.g., chest tubes for pneumothorax) for classification, a strategy that fails for precise segmentation. We also found that expensive text-image alignment is not a prerequisite; image-only (RAD-DINO) and label-supervised (Ark+) FMs were among top performers. Notably, a supervised, end-to-end baseline remained highly competitive, matching or exceeding the best FMs on segmentation tasks. These findings show that while medical pre-training is beneficial, architectural choices (e.g., multi-scale) are critical, and pre-trained features are not universally effective, especially for complex localization tasks where supervised models remain a strong alternative.

### [11] [Gradient-Guided Exploration of Generative Model's Latent Space for Controlled Iris Image Augmentations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09749)
*Mahsa Mitcheff,Siamul Karim Khan,Adam Czajka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new iris image augmentation method that manipulates specific iris attributes while preserving identity by traversing a generative model's latent space guided by differentiable feature gradients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for diverse iris datasets with realistic variations and anomalies for reliable iris recognition and presentation attack detection, while overcoming challenges in synthesizing same-identity iris images with controlled attributes.

Method: Latent space traversal guided by gradients of specific iris features (sharpness, pupil size, iris size, pupil-to-iris ratio) using either GAN-generated or real iris images via GAN inversion, while preserving identity.

Result: The approach successfully manipulates desired iris image properties while maintaining identity consistency, and can be extended to any differentiable attribute.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an effective iris augmentation strategy that can generate diverse same-identity samples with controlled attribute variations for improved iris recognition systems.

Abstract: Developing reliable iris recognition and presentation attack detection methods requires diverse datasets that capture realistic variations in iris features and a wide spectrum of anomalies. Because of the rich texture of iris images, which spans a wide range of spatial frequencies, synthesizing same-identity iris images while controlling specific attributes remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a new iris image augmentation strategy by traversing a generative model's latent space toward latent codes that represent same-identity samples but with some desired iris image properties manipulated. The latent space traversal is guided by a gradient of specific geometrical, textural, or quality-related iris image features (e.g., sharpness, pupil size, iris size, or pupil-to-iris ratio) and preserves the identity represented by the image being manipulated. The proposed approach can be easily extended to manipulate any attribute for which a differentiable loss term can be formulated. Additionally, our approach can use either randomly generated images using either a pre-train GAN model or real-world iris images. We can utilize GAN inversion to project any given iris image into the latent space and obtain its corresponding latent code.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STORM is an annotation-free 6D pose estimation system that combines vision-language understanding with self-supervised feature matching for robust real-time performance in challenging industrial scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 6D pose estimation methods require manual annotation of target segmentation masks, which is labor-intensive and performs poorly under occlusions or rapid movement.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: contextual object descriptions guide localization, self-cross-attention identifies candidate regions, segmentation produces precise masks, plus automatic re-registration mechanism for tracking recovery.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging industrial datasets with multi-object occlusions, high-speed motion, and varying illumination, operating at real-time speeds without additional training.

Conclusion: Annotation-free approach significantly reduces deployment overhead, providing practical solution for flexible manufacturing and intelligent quality control applications.

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation and tracking are fundamental capabilities for physical AI systems such as robots. However, existing approaches typically rely on a manually annotated segmentation mask of the target in the first frame, which is labor-intensive and leads to reduced performance when faced with occlusions or rapid movement. To address these limi- tations, we propose STORM (Segment, Track, and Object Re-localization from a single 3D Model), an open-source robust real-time 6D pose estimation system that requires no manual annotation. STORM employs a novel three-stage pipeline combining vision-language understanding with self-supervised feature matching: contextual object descriptions guide localization, self-cross-attention mechanisms identify candidate regions, and a segmentation model produces precise masks for accurate pose estimation. Another key innovation is our automatic re-registration mechanism that detects tracking failures through feature similarity monitoring and recovers from severe occlusions or rapid motion. STORM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging industrial datasets featuring multi-object occlusions, high-speed motion, and varying illumination, while operating at real-time speeds without additional training. This annotation-free approach significantly reduces deployment overhead, providing a practical solution for modern applications, such as flexible manufacturing and intelligent quality control.

### [13] [PANDA - Patch And Distribution-Aware Augmentation for Long-Tailed Exemplar-Free Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09791)
*Siddeshwar Raghavan,Jiangpeng He,Fengqing Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PANDA is a patch-and-distribution-aware augmentation framework that addresses dual-level data imbalances in exemplar-free continual learning by amplifying low-frequency classes and smoothing inter-task imbalances using CLIP encoder and adaptive balancing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data streams exhibit dual-level imbalances (dataset-level distributions with extreme/reversed skews within tasks), creating intra-task and inter-task disparities that hinder learning and generalization in exemplar-free continual learning.

Method: PANDA uses CLIP encoder to identify representative regions from low-frequency classes and transplants them into frequent-class samples. It also employs adaptive balancing strategy leveraging prior task distributions to smooth inter-task imbalances.

Result: Extensive experiments show PANDA improves accuracy and reduces catastrophic forgetting when integrated with existing PTM-based continual learning methods.

Conclusion: PANDA effectively addresses dual-level data imbalances in exemplar-free continual learning, enhancing performance and reducing forgetting through patch-based augmentation and distribution-aware balancing.

Abstract: Exemplar-Free Continual Learning (EFCL) restricts the storage of previous task data and is highly susceptible to catastrophic forgetting. While pre-trained models (PTMs) are increasingly leveraged for EFCL, existing methods often overlook the inherent imbalance of real-world data distributions. We discovered that real-world data streams commonly exhibit dual-level imbalances, dataset-level distributions combined with extreme or reversed skews within individual tasks, creating both intra-task and inter-task disparities that hinder effective learning and generalization. To address these challenges, we propose PANDA, a Patch-and-Distribution-Aware Augmentation framework that integrates seamlessly with existing PTM-based EFCL methods. PANDA amplifies low-frequency classes by using a CLIP encoder to identify representative regions and transplanting those into frequent-class samples within each task. Furthermore, PANDA incorporates an adaptive balancing strategy that leverages prior task distributions to smooth inter-task imbalances, reducing the overall gap between average samples across tasks and enabling fairer learning with frozen PTMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate PANDA's capability to work with existing PTM-based CL methods, improving accuracy and reducing catastrophic forgetting.

*Konstantinos M. Dafnis,Dimitris N. Metaxas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STS is a lightweight test-time adaptation method that steers VLM representations using spectral analysis of text embeddings, achieving faster inference with minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time adaptation methods for VLMs require backpropagation through large encoders or modify core components, making them computationally expensive.

Method: Extracts spectral subspace from text embeddings to define semantic directions, learns per-sample shift parameters to minimize entropy across augmented views without backpropagation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods with 8x faster inference, 12x smaller memory footprint, and only a handful of additional parameters.

Conclusion: STS provides an efficient and effective test-time adaptation framework that operates entirely in latent space without modifying frozen encoders.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at zero-shot inference but often degrade under test-time domain shifts. For this reason, episodic test-time adaptation strategies have recently emerged as powerful techniques for adapting VLMs to a single unlabeled image. However, existing adaptation strategies, such as test-time prompt tuning, typically require backpropagating through large encoder weights or altering core model components. In this work, we introduce Spectrum-Aware Test-Time Steering (STS), a lightweight adaptation framework that extracts a spectral subspace from the textual embeddings to define principal semantic directions and learns to steer latent representations in a spectrum-aware manner by adapting a small number of per-sample shift parameters to minimize entropy across augmented views. STS operates entirely at inference in the latent space, without backpropagation through or modification of the frozen encoders. Building on standard evaluation protocols, our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that STS largely surpasses or compares favorably against state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods, while introducing only a handful of additional parameters and achieving inference speeds up to 8x faster with a 12x smaller memory footprint than conventional test-time prompt tuning.

TL;DR: Lumos3D is a generalizable pose-free framework for 3D low-light scene restoration that directly reconstructs normal-light 3D scenes from unposed multi-view images without per-scene optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D low-light restoration methods depend on precomputed camera poses and scene-specific optimization, which limits scalability to dynamic real-world environments.

Method: Built on geometry-grounded backbone with cross-illumination distillation scheme, where teacher network transfers accurate geometric information to student model, and dedicated Lumos loss promotes photometric consistency in reconstructed 3D space.

Result: Achieves high-fidelity low-light 3D scene restoration with accurate geometry and strong generalization to unseen cases, and naturally extends to handle over-exposure correction.

Conclusion: Lumos3D provides a versatile framework for diverse lighting restoration tasks with strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Restoring 3D scenes captured under low-light con- ditions remains a fundamental yet challenging problem. Most existing approaches depend on precomputed camera poses and scene-specific optimization, which greatly restricts their scala- bility to dynamic real-world environments. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Lumos3D, a generalizable pose-free framework for 3D low-light scene restoration. Trained once on a single dataset, Lumos3D performs inference in a purely feed- forward manner, directly restoring illumination and structure from unposed, low-light multi-view images without any per- scene training or optimization. Built upon a geometry-grounded backbone, Lumos3D reconstructs a normal-light 3D Gaussian representation that restores illumination while faithfully pre- serving structural details. During training, a cross-illumination distillation scheme is employed, where the teacher network is distilled on normal-light ground truth to transfer accurate geometric information, such as depth, to the student model. A dedicated Lumos loss is further introduced to promote photomet- ric consistency within the reconstructed 3D space. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that Lumos3D achieves high- fidelity low-light 3D scene restoration with accurate geometry and strong generalization to unseen cases. Furthermore, the framework naturally extends to handle over-exposure correction, highlighting its versatility for diverse lighting restoration tasks.

TL;DR: A zero-shot cross-view image retrieval framework using pretrained vision encoders and LLMs for street-to-satellite matching without additional training, outperforming supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-view retrieval methods require supervised training on curated datasets and rely on panoramic/UAV images, limiting real-world deployment. Need for scalable, training-free approaches.

Method: Extracts geographic cues from monocular street-view images via web search and LLM location inference, generates satellite queries via geocoding API, and retrieves matches using DINOv2 with PCA-based whitening feature refinement.

Result: Outperforms prior learning-based approaches on benchmark datasets under zero-shot settings without ground-truth supervision or finetuning. Enables automatic construction of semantically aligned street-to-satellite datasets.

Conclusion: Proposed framework provides effective, scalable cross-view retrieval without training, offering cost-efficient alternative to manual annotation and enabling real-world deployment.

Abstract: Cross-view image retrieval, particularly street-to-satellite matching, is a critical task for applications such as autonomous navigation, urban planning, and localization in GPS-denied environments. However, existing approaches often require supervised training on curated datasets and rely on panoramic or UAV-based images, which limits real-world deployment. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective cross-view image retrieval framework that leverages a pretrained vision encoder and a large language model (LLM), requiring no additional training. Given a monocular street-view image, our method extracts geographic cues through web-based image search and LLM-based location inference, generates a satellite query via geocoding API, and retrieves matching tiles using a pretrained vision encoder (e.g., DINOv2) with PCA-based whitening feature refinement. Despite using no ground-truth supervision or finetuning, our proposed method outperforms prior learning-based approaches on the benchmark dataset under zero-shot settings. Moreover, our pipeline enables automatic construction of semantically aligned street-to-satellite datasets, which is offering a scalable and cost-efficient alternative to manual annotation.

*Aymen Mir,Jian Wang,Riza Alp Guler,Chuan Guo,Gerard Pons-Moll,Bing Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework using 3D Gaussian Splatting for animating humans in 3D scenes, enabling geometry-consistent free-viewpoint rendering without requiring paired human-scene data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting achieves state-of-the-art novel-view synthesis but remains unexplored for human-scene animation and interaction, unlike existing mesh or point cloud-based approaches.

Method: Uses 3DGS as 3D representation with decoupled rendering and motion synthesis. Includes Gaussian-aligned motion module using opacity cues and projected structures, plus human-scene Gaussian refinement for realistic contact and navigation.

Result: Evaluated on Scannet++ and SuperSplat scenes with avatars from sparse/dense multi-view capture. Enables geometry-consistent free-viewpoint rendering of edited monocular videos with new animated humans.

Conclusion: Demonstrates unique advantages of 3DGS for monocular video-based human animation, providing a novel approach to human-scene interaction without paired data requirements.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for animating humans in 3D scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a neural scene representation that has recently achieved state-of-the-art photorealistic results for novel-view synthesis but remains under-explored for human-scene animation and interaction. Unlike existing animation pipelines that use meshes or point clouds as the underlying 3D representation, our approach introduces the use of 3DGS as the 3D representation to the problem of animating humans in scenes. By representing humans and scenes as Gaussians, our approach allows for geometry-consistent free-viewpoint rendering of humans interacting with 3D scenes. Our key insight is that the rendering can be decoupled from the motion synthesis and each sub-problem can be addressed independently, without the need for paired human-scene data. Central to our method is a Gaussian-aligned motion module that synthesizes motion without explicit scene geometry, using opacity-based cues and projected Gaussian structures to guide human placement and pose alignment. To ensure natural interactions, we further propose a human-scene Gaussian refinement optimization that enforces realistic contact and navigation. We evaluate our approach on scenes from Scannet++ and the SuperSplat library, and on avatars reconstructed from sparse and dense multi-view human capture. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework allows for novel applications such as geometry-consistent free-viewpoint rendering of edited monocular RGB videos with new animated humans, showcasing the unique advantage of 3DGS for monocular video-based human animation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CertMask is a certifiably robust defense against adversarial patch attacks that uses a single round of masking with O(n) complexity, outperforming previous methods in both efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial patch attacks pose serious risks to real-world applications by injecting localized perturbations that mislead deep vision models, requiring efficient and provably robust defenses.

Method: CertMask constructs a provably sufficient set of binary masks using a mathematically rigorous coverage strategy that ensures each possible patch location is covered at least k times, performing only a single round of masking.

Result: Experiments show CertMask improves certified robust accuracy by up to +13.4% over PatchCleanser while maintaining clean accuracy nearly identical to the vanilla model, with O(n) time complexity vs O(n²).

Conclusion: CertMask provides an efficient and certifiably robust defense against adversarial patch attacks with strong theoretical guarantees and practical performance improvements.

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks inject localized perturbations into images to mislead deep vision models. These attacks can be physically deployed, posing serious risks to real-world applications. In this paper, we propose CertMask, a certifiably robust defense that constructs a provably sufficient set of binary masks to neutralize patch effects with strong theoretical guarantees. While the state-of-the-art approach (PatchCleanser) requires two rounds of masking and incurs $O(n^2)$ inference cost, CertMask performs only a single round of masking with $O(n)$ time complexity, where $n$ is the cardinality of the mask set to cover an input image. Our proposed mask set is computed using a mathematically rigorous coverage strategy that ensures each possible patch location is covered at least $k$ times, providing both efficiency and robustness. We offer a theoretical analysis of the coverage condition and prove its sufficiency for certification. Experiments on ImageNet, ImageNette, and CIFAR-10 show that CertMask improves certified robust accuracy by up to +13.4\% over PatchCleanser, while maintaining clean accuracy nearly identical to the vanilla model.

Conclusion: SPOT provides an effective framework for token sparsification in Vision Transformers that improves computational efficiency without sacrificing performance, with versatile design adaptable to different resource constraints.

Abstract: While Vision Transformers (ViT) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse tasks, their computational demands are substantial, scaling quadratically with the number of processed tokens. Compact attention representations, reflecting token interaction distributions, can guide early detection and reduction of less salient tokens prior to attention computation. Motivated by this, we present SParsification with attentiOn dynamics via Token relevance (SPOT), a framework for early detection of redundant tokens within ViTs that leverages token embeddings, interactions, and attention dynamics across layers to infer token importance, resulting in a more context-aware and interpretable relevance detection process. SPOT informs token sparsification and facilitates the elimination of such tokens, improving computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. SPOT employs computationally lightweight predictors that can be plugged into various ViT architectures and learn to derive effective input-specific token prioritization across layers. Its versatile design supports a range of performance levels adaptable to varying resource constraints. Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant efficiency gains of up to 40% compared to standard ViTs, while maintaining or even improving accuracy.

TL;DR: This paper adapts a solar physics foundation model to create embeddings for solar wind structure classification, combining them with spacecraft position data and Fourier features to build a neural field-based model for space weather prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Space weather poses growing risks to satellites and ground infrastructure, but automated classification of solar wind structures is challenging due to their variable properties. The research aims to bridge the gap between remote sensing and in-situ observations.

Method: Adapted a foundation model trained on Solar Dynamics Observatory imagery to create embeddings, concatenated with spacecraft position and solar magnetic connectivity encoded using Fourier features, forming a neural field-based model fine-tuned with Parker Solar Probe measurements.

Result: Overall classification performance was modest, likely due to coarse labeling, class imbalance, and limited transferability of the pretrained model, but the study demonstrates feasibility of using foundation model embeddings for in situ solar wind tasks.

Conclusion: This proof-of-concept lays groundwork for future improvements toward more reliable space weather predictions, with code and configuration files made publicly available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Space weather at Earth, driven by the solar activity, poses growing risks to satellites around our planet as well as to critical ground-based technological infrastructure. Major space weather contributors are the solar wind and coronal mass ejections whose variable density, speed, temperature, and magnetic field make the automated classification of those structures challenging. In this work, we adapt a foundation model for solar physics, originally trained on Solar Dynamics Observatory imagery, to create embeddings suitable for solar wind structure analysis. These embeddings are concatenated with the spacecraft position and solar magnetic connectivity encoded using Fourier features which generates a neural field-based model. The full deep learning architecture is fine-tuned bridging the gap between remote sensing and in situ observations. Labels are derived from Parker Solar Probe measurements, forming a downstream classification task that maps plasma properties to solar wind structures. Although overall classification performance is modest, likely due to coarse labeling, class imbalance, and limited transferability of the pretrained model, this study demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging foundation model embeddings for in situ solar wind tasks. As a first proof-of-concept, it lays the groundwork for future improvements toward more reliable space weather predictions.

TL;DR: IPCD-Net extends image-based decomposition to point clouds, separating albedo from shade using point-wise feature aggregation and multi-view projection to capture global lighting, enabling applications like texture editing and relighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point clouds need albedo-shade separation for realistic visualization in AR and robotics, but face challenges from non-grid structure and lack of global-light consideration in existing methods.

Method: Proposes IPCD-Net with point-wise feature aggregation for non-grid processing and Projection-based Luminance Distribution with hierarchical refinement to capture global lighting via multi-view projection.

Result: IPCD-Net reduces cast shadows in albedo, enhances color accuracy in shade, and enables applications in texture editing, relighting, and illumination-variant point-cloud registration.

Conclusion: IPCD-Net effectively decomposes point clouds into albedo and shade, demonstrating real-world applicability for various visualization and editing tasks.

Abstract: Point clouds are widely used in various fields, including augmented reality (AR) and robotics, where relighting and texture editing are crucial for realistic visualization. Achieving these tasks requires accurately separating albedo from shade. However, performing this separation on point clouds presents two key challenges: (1) the non-grid structure of point clouds makes conventional image-based decomposition models ineffective, and (2) point-cloud models designed for other tasks do not explicitly consider global-light direction, resulting in inaccurate shade. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{Intrinsic Point-Cloud Decomposition (IPCD)}, which extends image decomposition to the direct decomposition of colored point clouds into albedo and shade. To overcome challenge (1), we propose \textbf{IPCD-Net} that extends image-based model with point-wise feature aggregation for non-grid data processing. For challenge (2), we introduce \textbf{Projection-based Luminance Distribution (PLD)} with a hierarchical feature refinement, capturing global-light ques via multi-view projection. For comprehensive evaluation, we create a synthetic outdoor-scene dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that IPCD-Net reduces cast shadows in albedo and enhances color accuracy in shade. Furthermore, we showcase its applications in texture editing, relighting, and point-cloud registration under varying illumination. Finally, we verify the real-world applicability of IPCD-Net.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T-DRS is an inference-only method that addresses progressive attention decay in LVLMs using three strategies: SD-DRS amplifies distant semantic signals, DC-DRS modulates attention weights by distance, and reRD-DRS reinforces remote dependencies to maintain global coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models using Rotary Positional Encoding suffer from progressive attention decay over distant token pairs, impairing their ability to remember global context and model long-range dependencies.

Method: Three-step Decay Resilience Strategies (T-DRS): 1) Semantic-Driven DRS amplifies semantically meaningful distant signals via content-aware residuals, 2) Distance-aware Control DRS purifies attention by modulating weights based on positional distances, and 3) re-Reinforce Distant DRS consolidates remaining informative remote dependencies.

Result: Extensive experiments on Vision Question Answering benchmarks demonstrate that T-DRS consistently improves performance in a training-free manner.

Conclusion: T-DRS effectively recovers suppressed long-range token pairs without harming local inductive biases, addressing the attention decay issue in LVLMs.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of multimodal tasks. However, they still face critical challenges in modeling long-range dependencies under the usage of Rotary Positional Encoding (ROPE). Although it can facilitate precise modeling of token positions, it induces progressive attention decay as token distance increases, especially with progressive attention decay over distant token pairs, which severely impairs the model's ability to remember global context. To alleviate this issue, we propose inference-only Three-step Decay Resilience Strategies (T-DRS), comprising (1) Semantic-Driven DRS (SD-DRS), amplifying semantically meaningful but distant signals via content-aware residuals, (2) Distance-aware Control DRS (DC-DRS), which can purify attention by smoothly modulating weights based on positional distances, suppressing noise while preserving locality, and (3) re-Reinforce Distant DRS (reRD-DRS), consolidating the remaining informative remote dependencies to maintain global coherence. Together, the T-DRS recover suppressed long-range token pairs without harming local inductive biases. Extensive experiments on Vision Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks demonstrate that T-DRS can consistently improve performance in a training-free manner.

TL;DR: SAM-DAQ adapts SAM2 for RGB-D video salient object detection by integrating depth and temporal cues using depth-guided parallel adapters and query-driven temporal memory, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct application of SAM to RGB-D VSOD faces challenges: manual prompt dependence, high memory consumption from sequential adapters, and computational burden of memory attention.

Method: Uses depth-guided parallel adapters (DPAs) in a multi-modal image encoder for prompt-free fine-tuning, and a query-driven temporal memory (QTM) module that unifies memory bank and prompt embeddings using frame-level and video-level queries.

Result: Extensive experiments on three RGB-D VSOD datasets show SAM-DAQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: SAM-DAQ successfully addresses SAM's limitations for RGB-D VSOD through depth-guided adaptation and efficient temporal modeling, demonstrating superior performance without manual prompts.

Abstract: Recently segment anything model (SAM) has attracted widespread concerns, and it is often treated as a vision foundation model for universal segmentation. Some researchers have attempted to directly apply the foundation model to the RGB-D video salient object detection (RGB-D VSOD) task, which often encounters three challenges, including the dependence on manual prompts, the high memory consumption of sequential adapters, and the computational burden of memory attention. To address the limitations, we propose a novel method, namely Segment Anything Model with Depth-guided Adaptive Queries (SAM-DAQ), which adapts SAM2 to pop-out salient objects from videos by seamlessly integrating depth and temporal cues within a unified framework. Firstly, we deploy a parallel adapter-based multi-modal image encoder (PAMIE), which incorporates several depth-guided parallel adapters (DPAs) in a skip-connection way. Remarkably, we fine-tune the frozen SAM encoder under prompt-free conditions, where the DPA utilizes depth cues to facilitate the fusion of multi-modal features. Secondly, we deploy a query-driven temporal memory (QTM) module, which unifies the memory bank and prompt embeddings into a learnable pipeline. Concretely, by leveraging both frame-level queries and video-level queries simultaneously, the QTM module can not only selectively extract temporal consistency features but also iteratively update the temporal representations of the queries. Extensive experiments are conducted on three RGB-D VSOD datasets, and the results show that the proposed SAM-DAQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of all evaluation metrics.

Result: Reduces parameter count by 4.18× and improves memory efficiency by 1.37× compared to PointSSC, while achieving state-of-the-art performance on indoor and outdoor datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight design effectively addresses the limitations of existing dense architectures while maintaining high performance in semantic scene completion tasks.

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to generate a complete semantic scene from an incomplete input. Existing approaches often employ dense network architectures with a high parameter count, leading to increased model complexity and resource demands. To address these limitations, we propose RWKV-PCSSC, a lightweight point cloud semantic scene completion network inspired by the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) mechanism. Specifically, we introduce a RWKV Seed Generator (RWKV-SG) module that can aggregate features from a partial point cloud to produce a coarse point cloud with coarse features. Subsequently, the point-wise feature of the point cloud is progressively restored through multiple stages of the RWKV Point Deconvolution (RWKV-PD) modules. By leveraging a compact and efficient design, our method achieves a lightweight model representation. Experimental results demonstrate that RWKV-PCSSC reduces the parameter count by 4.18$\times$ and improves memory efficiency by 1.37$\times$ compared to state-of-the-art methods PointSSC. Furthermore, our network achieves state-of-the-art performance on established indoor (SSC-PC, NYUCAD-PC) and outdoor (PointSSC) scene dataset, as well as on our proposed datasets (NYUCAD-PC-V2, 3D-FRONT-PC).

TL;DR: HCC-3D introduces hierarchical compression to reduce computational costs in 3D-VLMs by compressing 3D tokens while maintaining critical information through global structure compression and adaptive detail mining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D-VLMs have high computational costs due to processing all 3D tokens in LLMs, limiting practical applications. The goal is to reduce this overhead while preserving essential 3D information.

Method: Proposes Hierarchical Compensatory Compression with two modules: Global Structure Compression (GSC) using global queries to compress tokens, and Adaptive Detail Mining (ADM) to selectively recompress salient features through complementary scoring.

Result: Achieves extreme compression ratios (~98%) compared to previous 3D-VLMs while achieving state-of-the-art performance, improving both efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: HCC-3D successfully addresses the computational bottleneck in 3D-VLMs through hierarchical compression, enabling efficient 3D understanding without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: 3D understanding has drawn significant attention recently, leveraging Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enable multi-modal reasoning between point cloud and text data. Current 3D-VLMs directly embed the 3D point clouds into 3D tokens, following large 2D-VLMs with powerful reasoning capabilities. However, this framework has a great computational cost limiting its application, where we identify that the bottleneck lies in processing all 3D tokens in the Large Language Model (LLM) part. This raises the question: how can we reduce the computational overhead introduced by 3D tokens while preserving the integrity of their essential information? To address this question, we introduce Hierarchical Compensatory Compression (HCC-3D) to efficiently compress 3D tokens while maintaining critical detail retention. Specifically, we first propose a global structure compression (GSC), in which we design global queries to compress all 3D tokens into a few key tokens while keeping overall structural information. Then, to compensate for the information loss in GSC, we further propose an adaptive detail mining (ADM) module that selectively recompresses salient but under-attended features through complementary scoring. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HCC-3D not only achieves extreme compression ratios (approximately 98%) compared to previous 3D-VLMs, but also achieves new state-of-the-art performance, showing the great improvements on both efficiency and performance.

TL;DR: Proposes Scale-Aware Relay Layer (SARL) and Scale-Adaptive Loss (SAL) to improve tiny object detection in aerial images by addressing feature degradation and disproportionate regression penalties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern detectors struggle with tiny objects in aerial images due to limited features being degraded during network propagation and disproportionate regression penalties favoring larger objects.

Method: SARL uses cross-scale spatial-channel attention to enrich features and strengthen cross-layer sharing. SAL reshapes IoU-based losses to dynamically assign lower weights to larger objects, focusing training on tiny objects.

Result: Boosts generalization by 5.5% AP when embedded in YOLOv5 and YOLOx baselines across AI-TOD, DOTA-v2.0 and VisDrone2019 benchmarks. Achieves 29.0% AP on noisy AI-TOD-v2.0 dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed SARL and SAL effectively address tiny object detection challenges and demonstrate strong performance improvements across multiple benchmarks and noisy datasets.

Abstract: Recently, despite the remarkable advancements in object detection, modern detectors still struggle to detect tiny objects in aerial images. One key reason is that tiny objects carry limited features that are inevitably degraded or lost during long-distance network propagation. Another is that smaller objects receive disproportionately greater regression penalties than larger ones during training. To tackle these issues, we propose a Scale-Aware Relay Layer (SARL) and a Scale-Adaptive Loss (SAL) for tiny object detection, both of which are seamlessly compatible with the top-performing frameworks. Specifically, SARL employs a cross-scale spatial-channel attention to progressively enrich the meaningful features of each layer and strengthen the cross-layer feature sharing. SAL reshapes the vanilla IoU-based losses so as to dynamically assign lower weights to larger objects. This loss is able to focus training on tiny objects while reducing the influence on large objects. Extensive experiments are conducted on three benchmarks (\textit{i.e.,} AI-TOD, DOTA-v2.0 and VisDrone2019), and the results demonstrate that the proposed method boosts the generalization ability by 5.5\% Average Precision (AP) when embedded in YOLOv5 (anchor-based) and YOLOx (anchor-free) baselines. Moreover, it also promotes the robust performance with 29.0\% AP on the real-world noisy dataset (\textit{i.e.,} AI-TOD-v2.0).

Abstract: Automated medical image captioning translates complex radiological images into diagnostic narratives that can support reporting workflows. We present a Swin-BART encoder-decoder system with a lightweight regional attention module that amplifies diagnostically salient regions before cross-attention. Trained and evaluated on ROCO, our model achieves state-of-the-art semantic fidelity while remaining compact and interpretable. We report results as mean$\pm$std over three seeds and include $95\%$ confidence intervals. Compared with baselines, our approach improves ROUGE (proposed 0.603, ResNet-CNN 0.356, BLIP2-OPT 0.255) and BERTScore (proposed 0.807, BLIP2-OPT 0.645, ResNet-CNN 0.623), with competitive BLEU, CIDEr, and METEOR. We further provide ablations (regional attention on/off and token-count sweep), per-modality analysis (CT/MRI/X-ray), paired significance tests, and qualitative heatmaps that visualize the regions driving each description. Decoding uses beam search (beam size $=4$), length penalty $=1.1$, $no\_repeat\_ngram\_size$ $=3$, and max length $=128$. The proposed design yields accurate, clinically phrased captions and transparent regional attributions, supporting safe research use with a human in the loop.

*Zihao Zhang,Yang Li,Aming Wu,Yahong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Liquid Temporal Feature Evolution for Single-Domain Generalized Object Detection, using temporal modeling and liquid neural networks to simulate continuous domain shifts through progressive feature evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use discrete data augmentation or static perturbations, which fail to capture dynamic feature distribution changes in real-world scenarios like weather/lighting shifts.

Method: Uses controllable Gaussian noise injection and multi-scale Gaussian blurring for initial perturbations, then temporal modeling with liquid parameter adjustment to generate adaptive modulation parameters for smooth cross-domain adaptation.

Result: Significant performance improvements on Diverse Weather dataset and Real-to-Art benchmark, demonstrating superior generalization to unseen domain shifts.

Conclusion: The method effectively bridges source-unknown domain distribution gaps by capturing progressive cross-domain feature evolution and dynamically regulating adaptation paths.

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on Single-Domain Generalized Object Detection (Single-DGOD), aiming to transfer a detector trained on one source domain to multiple unknown domains. Existing methods for Single-DGOD typically rely on discrete data augmentation or static perturbation methods to expand data diversity, thereby mitigating the lack of access to target domain data. However, in real-world scenarios such as changes in weather or lighting conditions, domain shifts often occur continuously and gradually. Discrete augmentations and static perturbations fail to effectively capture the dynamic variation of feature distributions, thereby limiting the model's ability to perceive fine-grained cross-domain differences. To this end, we propose a new method, Liquid Temporal Feature Evolution, which simulates the progressive evolution of features from the source domain to simulated latent distributions by incorporating temporal modeling and liquid neural network-driven parameter adjustment. Specifically, we introduce controllable Gaussian noise injection and multi-scale Gaussian blurring to simulate initial feature perturbations, followed by temporal modeling and a liquid parameter adjustment mechanism to generate adaptive modulation parameters, enabling a smooth and continuous adaptation across domains. By capturing progressive cross-domain feature evolution and dynamically regulating adaptation paths, our method bridges the source-unknown domain distribution gap, significantly boosting generalization and robustness to unseen shifts. Significant performance improvements on the Diverse Weather dataset and Real-to-Art benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/2490o/LTFE.

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their capabilities are inadequately assessed by existing benchmarks, which are predominantly English-centric, feature simplistic layouts, and support limited tasks. Consequently, they fail to evaluate model performance for Visually Rich Document Understanding (VRDU), a critical challenge involving complex layouts and dense text. To address this, we introduce DocWeaver, a novel multi-agent pipeline that leverages Large Language Models to automatically generate a new benchmark. The result is MosaicDoc, a large-scale, bilingual (Chinese and English) resource designed to push the boundaries of VRDU. Sourced from newspapers and magazines, MosaicDoc features diverse and complex layouts (including multi-column and non-Manhattan), rich stylistic variety from 196 publishers, and comprehensive multi-task annotations (OCR, VQA, reading order, and localization). With 72K images and over 600K QA pairs, MosaicDoc serves as a definitive benchmark for the field. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models on this benchmark reveals their current limitations in handling real-world document complexity and charts a clear path for future research.

*Xuan Rao,Simian Xu,Zheng Li,Bo Zhao,Derong Liu,Mingming Ha,Cesare Alippi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SLDC introduces latent space transition operators to compensate for distribution drift in sequential fine-tuning for class-incremental learning, achieving performance comparable to joint training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sequential fine-tuning of ViTs suffers from distribution drift due to sequential optimization, causing mismatch between learned class distributions and the updater model, degrading classifier performance over time.

Method: Proposes linear and weakly nonlinear SLDC variants that learn transition operators to align feature distributions across tasks, combined with knowledge distillation to reduce representation drift.

Result: SLDC significantly improves SeqFT performance on standard CIL benchmarks, achieving comparable performance to joint training across all evaluated datasets.

Conclusion: Combining knowledge distillation for representation drift with SLDC for distribution drift compensation enables SeqFT to achieve joint training-level performance in class-incremental learning.

Abstract: Recent advances have shown that sequential fine-tuning (SeqFT) of pre-trained vision transformers (ViTs), followed by classifier refinement using approximate distributions of class features, can be an effective strategy for class-incremental learning (CIL). However, this approach is susceptible to distribution drift, caused by the sequential optimization of shared backbone parameters. This results in a mismatch between the distributions of the previously learned classes and that of the updater model, ultimately degrading the effectiveness of classifier performance over time. To address this issue, we introduce a latent space transition operator and propose Sequential Learning with Drift Compensation (SLDC). SLDC aims to align feature distributions across tasks to mitigate the impact of drift. First, we present a linear variant of SLDC, which learns a linear operator by solving a regularized least-squares problem that maps features before and after fine-tuning. Next, we extend this with a weakly nonlinear SLDC variant, which assumes that the ideal transition operator lies between purely linear and fully nonlinear transformations. This is implemented using learnable, weakly nonlinear mappings that balance flexibility and generalization. To further reduce representation drift, we apply knowledge distillation (KD) in both algorithmic variants. Extensive experiments on standard CIL benchmarks demonstrate that SLDC significantly improves the performance of SeqFT. Notably, by combining KD to address representation drift with SLDC to compensate distribution drift, SeqFT achieves performance comparable to joint training across all evaluated datasets.

*Yuhang Zhou,Yanxiang Zhao,Zhongyun Hua,Zhipu Liu,Zhaoquan Gu,Qing Liao,Leo Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a debiased dual-invariant defense framework for person ReID that addresses model bias and composite generalization requirements through data balancing and bi-adversarial self-meta defense.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Person ReID models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, but existing defenses don't address the unique challenges of metric learning tasks like model bias and composite generalization requirements.

Method: Two-phase framework: 1) Data balancing using diffusion-model-based resampling for fairness and diversity; 2) Bi-adversarial self-meta defense with metric adversarial training and farthest negative extension softening, plus adversarially-enhanced self-meta mechanism.

Result: Experiments show the method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art defense approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the specific challenges of adversarial defense in person ReID, achieving robust performance against both unseen identities and attack types.

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) is a fundamental task in many real-world applications such as pedestrian trajectory tracking. However, advanced deep learning-based ReID models are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, where imperceptible perturbations to pedestrian images can cause entirely incorrect predictions, posing significant security threats. Although numerous adversarial defense strategies have been proposed for classification tasks, their extension to metric learning tasks such as person ReID remains relatively unexplored. Moreover, the several existing defenses for person ReID fail to address the inherent unique challenges of adversarially robust ReID. In this paper, we systematically identify the challenges of adversarial defense in person ReID into two key issues: model bias and composite generalization requirements. To address them, we propose a debiased dual-invariant defense framework composed of two main phases. In the data balancing phase, we mitigate model bias using a diffusion-model-based data resampling strategy that promotes fairness and diversity in training data. In the bi-adversarial self-meta defense phase, we introduce a novel metric adversarial training approach incorporating farthest negative extension softening to overcome the robustness degradation caused by the absence of classifier. Additionally, we introduce an adversarially-enhanced self-meta mechanism to achieve dual-generalization for both unseen identities and unseen attack types. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art defenses.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision GNNs face computational challenges from graph construction, hindering their efficiency despite their power.

Method: Hybrid Vision GNN with Adaptive Graph Convolution using static axial scaffold and dynamic Exponential Decay Gating for selective long-range connections, plus Global Attention in final stage.

Result: AdaptViG-M achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy (outperforming ViG-B by 0.3%) with 80% fewer parameters and 84% fewer GMACs. On downstream tasks, surpasses EfficientFormer-L7 with 78% fewer parameters.

Conclusion: AdaptViG provides an efficient and powerful solution for Vision GNNs with superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) offer a new direction for advancements in vision architectures. While powerful, ViGs often face substantial computational challenges stemming from their graph construction phase, which can hinder their efficiency. To address this issue we propose AdaptViG, an efficient and powerful hybrid Vision GNN that introduces a novel graph construction mechanism called Adaptive Graph Convolution. This mechanism builds upon a highly efficient static axial scaffold and a dynamic, content-aware gating strategy called Exponential Decay Gating. This gating mechanism selectively weighs long-range connections based on feature similarity. Furthermore, AdaptViG employs a hybrid strategy, utilizing our efficient gating mechanism in the early stages and a full Global Attention block in the final stage for maximum feature aggregation. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art trade-off between accuracy and efficiency among Vision GNNs. For instance, our AdaptViG-M achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy, outperforming ViG-B by 0.3% while using 80% fewer parameters and 84% fewer GMACs. On downstream tasks, AdaptViG-M obtains 45.8 mIoU, 44.8 APbox, and 41.1 APmask, surpassing the much larger EfficientFormer-L7 by 0.7 mIoU, 2.2 APbox, and 2.1 APmask, respectively, with 78% fewer parameters.

*Zhiyuan Xu,Nan Min,Yuhang Guo,Tong Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TSPE-GS improves 3D Gaussian Splatting for semi-transparent surfaces by modeling multi-modal depth distributions instead of assuming single depth per pixel, enabling better reconstruction of transparent objects while maintaining performance on opaque scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting struggles with semi-transparent surfaces because existing methods assume a single depth per pixel, which fails when multiple surfaces are visible through transparency.

Method: TSPE-GS uniformly samples transmittance to model pixel-wise multi-modal distributions of opacity and depth, progressively fuses truncated signed distance functions to reconstruct external and internal surfaces separately within a unified framework.

Result: Extensive experiments show TSPE-GS significantly improves semi-transparent geometry reconstruction while maintaining performance on opaque scenes across public and self-collected datasets.

Conclusion: The method successfully resolves cross-surface depth ambiguity in transparent objects and generalizes to other Gaussian-based reconstruction pipelines without extra training overhead.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting offers a strong speed-quality trade-off but struggles to reconstruct semi-transparent surfaces because most methods assume a single depth per pixel, which fails when multiple surfaces are visible. We propose TSPE-GS (Transparent Surface Probabilistic Extraction for Gaussian Splatting), which uniformly samples transmittance to model a pixel-wise multi-modal distribution of opacity and depth, replacing the prior single-peak assumption and resolving cross-surface depth ambiguity. By progressively fusing truncated signed distance functions, TSPE-GS reconstructs external and internal surfaces separately within a unified framework. The method generalizes to other Gaussian-based reconstruction pipelines without extra training overhead. Extensive experiments on public and self-collected semi-transparent and opaque datasets show TSPE-GS significantly improves semi-transparent geometry reconstruction while maintaining performance on opaque scenes.

### [34] [Beyond Cosine Similarity Magnitude-Aware CLIP for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09948)
*Zhicheng Liao,Dongxu Wu,Zhenshan Shi,Sijie Mai,Hanwei Zhu,Lingyu Zhu,Yuncheng Jiang,Baoliang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel CLIP-based NR-IQA method that combines cosine similarity with magnitude-aware quality cues using adaptive fusion, outperforming existing methods without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard CLIP-based IQA methods only use semantic similarity (cosine similarity between image embeddings and text prompts), ignoring the important quality cue in the magnitude of CLIP image features which correlates strongly with perceptual quality.

Method: Extract absolute CLIP image features, apply Box-Cox transformation for statistical normalization, and use confidence-guided fusion to adaptively combine the magnitude cue with cosine similarity.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark IQA datasets show consistent performance improvements over standard CLIP-based IQA and state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The magnitude of CLIP image features provides valuable quality cues that complement semantic similarity, and adaptive fusion of both cues leads to superior NR-IQA performance without requiring task-specific training.

Abstract: Recent efforts have repurposed the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) by measuring the cosine similarity between the image embedding and textual prompts such as "a good photo" or "a bad photo." However, this semantic similarity overlooks a critical yet underexplored cue: the magnitude of the CLIP image features, which we empirically find to exhibit a strong correlation with perceptual quality. In this work, we introduce a novel adaptive fusion framework that complements cosine similarity with a magnitude-aware quality cue. Specifically, we first extract the absolute CLIP image features and apply a Box-Cox transformation to statistically normalize the feature distribution and mitigate semantic sensitivity. The resulting scalar summary serves as a semantically-normalized auxiliary cue that complements cosine-based prompt matching. To integrate both cues effectively, we further design a confidence-guided fusion scheme that adaptively weighs each term according to its relative strength. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark IQA datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms standard CLIP-based IQA and state-of-the-art baselines, without any task-specific training.

*Uday Bhaskar,Rishabh Bhattacharya,Avinash Patel,Sarthak Khoche,Praveen Anil Kulkarni,Naresh Manwani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A pipeline using vision-language models to generate pseudo-labels for training efficient object detectors, with per-object co-teaching to handle noisy labels, achieving significant performance gains on autonomous driving datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models offer zero-shot object detection but have high latency and hallucination issues, making them unsuitable for direct deployment in autonomous driving where manual labeling is expensive.

Method: Leverages VLMs to generate pseudo-labels and introduces per-object co-teaching where two YOLO models collaboratively filter noisy bounding boxes based on peer loss values during training.

Result: Achieved mAP@0.5 boost from 31.12% to 46.61% on KITTI dataset while maintaining real-time latency. With 10% ground truth labels, reached 57.97% mAP@0.5. Similar improvements on ACDC and BDD100k datasets.

Conclusion: The pipeline provides efficient, robust, and scalable approach to train high-performance object detectors for autonomous driving, significantly reducing reliance on costly human annotation.

Abstract: Foundation models, especially vision-language models (VLMs), offer compelling zero-shot object detection for applications like autonomous driving, a domain where manual labelling is prohibitively expensive. However, their detection latency and tendency to hallucinate predictions render them unsuitable for direct deployment. This work introduces a novel pipeline that addresses this challenge by leveraging VLMs to automatically generate pseudo-labels for training efficient, real-time object detectors. Our key innovation is a per-object co-teaching-based training strategy that mitigates the inherent noise in VLM-generated labels. The proposed per-object coteaching approach filters noisy bounding boxes from training instead of filtering the entire image. Specifically, two YOLO models learn collaboratively, filtering out unreliable boxes from each mini-batch based on their peers' per-object loss values. Overall, our pipeline provides an efficient, robust, and scalable approach to train high-performance object detectors for autonomous driving, significantly reducing reliance on costly human annotation. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms a baseline YOLOv5m model, achieving a significant mAP@0.5 boost ($31.12\%$ to $46.61\%$) while maintaining real-time detection latency. Furthermore, we show that supplementing our pseudo-labelled data with a small fraction of ground truth labels ($10\%$) leads to further performance gains, reaching $57.97\%$ mAP@0.5 on the KITTI dataset. We observe similar performance improvements for the ACDC and BDD100k datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing problem-agnostic diffusion model-based image restoration methods fail to fully leverage diffusion priors, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: EquS imposes equivariant information through dual sampling trajectories and uses Timestep-Aware Schedule (TAS) to prioritize deterministic steps for enhanced certainty and sampling efficiency.

Result: Extensive experiments show EquS is compatible with previous methods and significantly boosts their performance without additional computational costs.

Conclusion: The proposed EquS method effectively addresses limitations of current problem-agnostic DMIR approaches by better utilizing diffusion priors through dual sampling and optimized scheduling.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models, especially diffusion models, have significantly improved image restoration (IR) performance. However, existing problem-agnostic diffusion model-based image restoration (DMIR) methods face challenges in fully leveraging diffusion priors, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we address the limitations of current problem-agnostic DMIR methods by analyzing their sampling process and providing effective solutions. We introduce EquS, a DMIR method that imposes equivariant information through dual sampling trajectories. To further boost EquS, we propose the Timestep-Aware Schedule (TAS) and introduce EquS$^+$. TAS prioritizes deterministic steps to enhance certainty and sampling efficiency.

TL;DR: DiVE preserves geometric structure in CLIP embeddings during fine-tuning by constraining difference vectors between pre-trained and fine-tuned models to be equal across samples, improving OOD and zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robust fine-tuning methods for vision-language models distort the geometric structure of embeddings, which is crucial for generalization, leading to limited OOD and zero-shot performance.

Method: Proposed Difference Vector Equalization (DiVE) with two losses: Average Vector Loss (AVL) to preserve global geometric structure by constraining difference vectors to their weighted average, and Pairwise Vector Loss (PVL) to preserve local geometric structure through consistent multimodal alignment.

Result: DiVE effectively preserves geometric structure and achieves strong results across in-distribution, out-of-distribution, and zero-shot metrics.

Conclusion: DiVE successfully fine-tunes vision-language models on in-distribution data while maintaining their generalization abilities in out-of-distribution and zero-shot settings by preserving the geometric structure of embeddings.

Abstract: Contrastive pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, demonstrate strong generalization abilities in zero-shot classification by leveraging embeddings extracted from image and text encoders. This paper aims to robustly fine-tune these vision-language models on in-distribution (ID) data without compromising their generalization abilities in out-of-distribution (OOD) and zero-shot settings. Current robust fine-tuning methods tackle this challenge by reusing contrastive learning, which was used in pre-training, for fine-tuning. However, we found that these methods distort the geometric structure of the embeddings, which plays a crucial role in the generalization of vision-language models, resulting in limited OOD and zero-shot performance. To address this, we propose Difference Vector Equalization (DiVE), which preserves the geometric structure during fine-tuning. The idea behind DiVE is to constrain difference vectors, each of which is obtained by subtracting the embeddings extracted from the pre-trained and fine-tuning models for the same data sample. By constraining the difference vectors to be equal across various data samples, we effectively preserve the geometric structure. Therefore, we introduce two losses: average vector loss (AVL) and pairwise vector loss (PVL). AVL preserves the geometric structure globally by constraining difference vectors to be equal to their weighted average. PVL preserves the geometric structure locally by ensuring a consistent multimodal alignment. Our experiments demonstrate that DiVE effectively preserves the geometric structure, achieving strong results across ID, OOD, and zero-shot metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current STE methods lack support for low-resource languages, suffer from domain gap between synthetic and real data, and lack appropriate metrics for evaluating text style preservation.

Method: Uses language-adaptive glyph encoder and multi-stage training (pre-training on synthetic data then fine-tuning on real images), constructs STIPLAR dataset, and proposes Text Appearance Similarity (TAS) metric.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models in visual consistency and recognition accuracy, achieving 2.2% average TAS improvement across languages over baselines.

Conclusion: STELLAR provides reliable multilingual scene text editing with improved style preservation and addresses key limitations in the field through novel architecture, training strategy, and evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Scene Text Editing (STE) is the task of modifying text content in an image while preserving its visual style, such as font, color, and background. While recent diffusion-based approaches have shown improvements in visual quality, key limitations remain: lack of support for low-resource languages, domain gap between synthetic and real data, and the absence of appropriate metrics for evaluating text style preservation. To address these challenges, we propose STELLAR (Scene Text Editor for Low-resource LAnguages and Real-world data). STELLAR enables reliable multilingual editing through a language-adaptive glyph encoder and a multi-stage training strategy that first pre-trains on synthetic data and then fine-tunes on real images. We also construct a new dataset, STIPLAR(Scene Text Image Pairs of Low-resource lAnguages and Real-world data), for training and evaluation. Furthermore, we propose Text Appearance Similarity (TAS), a novel metric that assesses style preservation by independently measuring font, color, and background similarity, enabling robust evaluation even without ground truth. Experimental results demonstrate that STELLAR outperforms state-of-the-art models in visual consistency and recognition accuracy, achieving an average TAS improvement of 2.2% across languages over the baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor attacks lack physical realizability due to digital-to-physical domain gaps and unoptimized physical triggers that are either ineffective or easily detectable.

Method: Systematic material selection (TiO2 for high diffuse reflectivity) and novel simulation pipeline with angle-independent Oren-Nayar BRDF model and distance-aware scaling for realistic LiDAR intensity generation.

Result: Achieves 93.50% attack success rate on state-of-the-art LiDAR-based and Camera-LiDAR fusion models, outperforming prior methods by over 41%.

Conclusion: Reveals a new class of physically realizable threats and underscores the need for defenses that account for material-level properties in real-world environments.

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D object detection is widely used in safety-critical systems. However, these systems remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that embed hidden malicious behaviors during training. A key limitation of existing backdoor attacks is their lack of physical realizability, primarily due to the digital-to-physical domain gap. Digital triggers often fail in real-world settings because they overlook material-dependent LiDAR reflection properties. On the other hand, physically constructed triggers are often unoptimized, leading to low effectiveness or easy detectability.This paper introduces Material-Oriented Backdoor Attack (MOBA), a novel framework that bridges the digital-physical gap by explicitly modeling the material properties of real-world triggers. MOBA tackles two key challenges in physical backdoor design: 1) robustness of the trigger material under diverse environmental conditions, 2) alignment between the physical trigger's behavior and its digital simulation. First, we propose a systematic approach to selecting robust trigger materials, identifying titanium dioxide (TiO_2) for its high diffuse reflectivity and environmental resilience. Second, to ensure the digital trigger accurately mimics the physical behavior of the material-based trigger, we develop a novel simulation pipeline that features: (1) an angle-independent approximation of the Oren-Nayar BRDF model to generate realistic LiDAR intensities, and (2) a distance-aware scaling mechanism to maintain spatial consistency across varying depths. We conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LiDAR-based and Camera-LiDAR fusion models, showing that MOBA achieves a 93.50% attack success rate, outperforming prior methods by over 41%. Our work reveals a new class of physically realizable threats and underscores the urgent need for defenses that account for material-level properties in real-world environments.

TL;DR: DBGroup is a two-stage weakly supervised 3D instance segmentation framework that uses scene-level annotations to reduce labeling costs while achieving competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing weakly supervised methods (one-thing-one-click and bounding box annotations) which are still labor-intensive, complex, and require expert annotators.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Dual-Branch Point Grouping module generates pseudo labels using semantic and mask cues from multi-view images, with refinement strategies (Granularity-Aware Instance Merging, Semantic Selection and Propagation). 2) Multi-round self-training on end-to-end instance segmentation network with Instance Mask Filter to handle pseudo label inconsistencies.

Result: Achieves competitive performance compared to sparse-point-level supervised 3D instance segmentation methods and surpasses state-of-the-art scene-level supervised 3D semantic segmentation approaches.

Conclusion: DBGroup provides an efficient and scalable solution for weakly supervised 3D instance segmentation using scene-level annotations, effectively reducing labeling costs while maintaining strong performance.

Abstract: Weakly supervised 3D instance segmentation is essential for 3D scene understanding, especially as the growing scale of data and high annotation costs associated with fully supervised approaches. Existing methods primarily rely on two forms of weak supervision: one-thing-one-click annotations and bounding box annotations, both of which aim to reduce labeling efforts. However, these approaches still encounter limitations, including labor-intensive annotation processes, high complexity, and reliance on expert annotators. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{DBGroup}, a two-stage weakly supervised 3D instance segmentation framework that leverages scene-level annotations as a more efficient and scalable alternative. In the first stage, we introduce a Dual-Branch Point Grouping module to generate pseudo labels guided by semantic and mask cues extracted from multi-view images. To further improve label quality, we develop two refinement strategies: Granularity-Aware Instance Merging and Semantic Selection and Propagation. The second stage involves multi-round self-training on an end-to-end instance segmentation network using the refined pseudo-labels. Additionally, we introduce an Instance Mask Filter strategy to address inconsistencies within the pseudo labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DBGroup achieves competitive performance compared to sparse-point-level supervised 3D instance segmentation methods, while surpassing state-of-the-art scene-level supervised 3D semantic segmentation approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quantization methods for Vision Transformers use uniform precision, ignoring the varying sensitivity of different components to quantization. Previous mixed precision methods suffer from coarse granularity, metric scale mismatch, and quantization-unaware bit allocation.

Method: LampQ performs layer-wise quantization with fine-grained control, uses a type-aware Fisher-based metric to measure sensitivity, assigns bit-widths optimally through integer linear programming, and iteratively updates them.

Result: Extensive experiments show LampQ achieves state-of-the-art performance in quantizing ViTs for various tasks including image classification, object detection, and zero-shot quantization.

Conclusion: LampQ overcomes key limitations of existing mixed precision quantization methods for Vision Transformers, providing accurate quantization with minimal accuracy degradation across multiple vision tasks.

Abstract: How can we accurately quantize a pre-trained Vision Transformer model? Quantization algorithms compress Vision Transformers (ViTs) into low-bit formats, reducing memory and computation demands with minimal accuracy degradation. However, existing methods rely on uniform precision, ignoring the diverse sensitivity of ViT components to quantization. Metric-based Mixed Precision Quantization (MPQ) is a promising alternative, but previous MPQ methods for ViTs suffer from three major limitations: 1) coarse granularity, 2) mismatch in metric scale across component types, and 3) quantization-unaware bit allocation. In this paper, we propose LampQ (Layer-wise Mixed Precision Quantization for Vision Transformers), an accurate metric-based MPQ method for ViTs to overcome these limitations. LampQ performs layer-wise quantization to achieve both fine-grained control and efficient acceleration, incorporating a type-aware Fisher-based metric to measure sensitivity. Then, LampQ assigns bit-widths optimally through integer linear programming and further updates them iteratively. Extensive experiments show that LampQ provides the state-of-the-art performance in quantizing ViTs pre-trained on various tasks such as image classification, object detection, and zero-shot quantization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on TongueAtlas-4K benchmark (4,000 images with 22 diagnostic labels), demonstrating effective handling of annotation scarcity and label imbalance while maintaining clinical plausibility.

Conclusion: MIRNet provides a robust framework for medical image analysis that generalizes beyond tongue diagnosis to broader diagnostic imaging tasks, effectively addressing key challenges in medical AI through integrated self-supervised learning and constrained reasoning.

Abstract: Automated interpretation of medical images demands robust modeling of complex visual-semantic relationships while addressing annotation scarcity, label imbalance, and clinical plausibility constraints. We introduce MIRNet (Medical Image Reasoner Network), a novel framework that integrates self-supervised pre-training with constrained graph-based reasoning. Tongue image diagnosis is a particularly challenging domain that requires fine-grained visual and semantic understanding. Our approach leverages self-supervised masked autoencoder (MAE) to learn transferable visual representations from unlabeled data; employs graph attention networks (GAT) to model label correlations through expert-defined structured graphs; enforces clinical priors via constraint-aware optimization using KL divergence and regularization losses; and mitigates imbalance using asymmetric loss (ASL) and boosting ensembles. To address annotation scarcity, we also introduce TongueAtlas-4K, a comprehensive expert-curated benchmark comprising 4,000 images annotated with 22 diagnostic labels--representing the largest public dataset in tongue analysis. Validation shows our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. While optimized for tongue diagnosis, the framework readily generalizes to broader diagnostic medical imaging tasks.

*Xinyi Wang,Xun Yang,Yanlong Xu,Yuchen Wu,Zhen Li,Na Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Fine-grained 3D Embodied Reasoning task and proposes AffordBot framework that uses MLLMs with chain-of-thought reasoning to predict spatial location, motion type, and motion axis for affordance elements in 3D scenes based on task instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches lack coherent instruction-driven grounding and reasoning for fine-grained affordance in physical environments, operating at object level or disjointedly handling affordance reasoning.

Method: AffordBot integrates Multimodal Large Language Models with chain-of-thought reasoning, renders surround-view images from 3D scenes, projects 3D element candidates into views, and uses active perception to select optimal viewpoints before step-by-step reasoning for localization and motion inference.

Result: Evaluated on SceneFun3D dataset, AffordBot achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong generalization and physically grounded reasoning using only 3D point cloud input and MLLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses fine-grained 3D embodied reasoning by bridging 3D input with 2D-compatible MLLMs through visual rendering and structured reasoning, demonstrating robust performance in affordance element prediction.

Abstract: Effective human-agent collaboration in physical environments requires understanding not only what to act upon, but also where the actionable elements are and how to interact with them. Existing approaches often operate at the object level or disjointedly handle fine-grained affordance reasoning, lacking coherent, instruction-driven grounding and reasoning. In this work, we introduce a new task: Fine-grained 3D Embodied Reasoning, which requires an agent to predict, for each referenced affordance element in a 3D scene, a structured triplet comprising its spatial location, motion type, and motion axis, based on a task instruction. To solve this task, we propose AffordBot, a novel framework that integrates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with a tailored chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning paradigm. To bridge the gap between 3D input and 2D-compatible MLLMs, we render surround-view images of the scene and project 3D element candidates into these views, forming a rich visual representation aligned with the scene geometry. Our CoT pipeline begins with an active perception stage, prompting the MLLM to select the most informative viewpoint based on the instruction, before proceeding with step-by-step reasoning to localize affordance elements and infer plausible interaction motions. Evaluated on the SceneFun3D dataset, AffordBot achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating strong generalization and physically grounded reasoning with only 3D point cloud input and MLLMs.

Motivation: To address the challenge of generating semantically coherent anomalies without requiring exemplar anomalies, and to improve downstream anomaly detection by creating more realistic and varied synthetic anomalies.

Method: Uses crossmodal prompt encoding to unify visual and textual cues, an inpainting-based generation pipeline, and contrastive refinement to align synthesized anomalies with their masks. Trained on AnomVerse dataset with 12,987 anomaly-mask-caption triplets from 13 public datasets.

Conclusion: Anomagic establishes a versatile foundation model for anomaly generation that outperforms existing methods and enables zero-shot anomaly creation for various applications.

Abstract: We propose Anomagic, a zero-shot anomaly generation method that produces semantically coherent anomalies without requiring any exemplar anomalies. By unifying both visual and textual cues through a crossmodal prompt encoding scheme, Anomagic leverages rich contextual information to steer an inpainting-based generation pipeline. A subsequent contrastive refinement strategy enforces precise alignment between synthesized anomalies and their masks, thereby bolstering downstream anomaly detection accuracy. To facilitate training, we introduce AnomVerse, a collection of 12,987 anomaly-mask-caption triplets assembled from 13 publicly available datasets, where captions are automatically generated by multimodal large language models using structured visual prompts and template-based textual hints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Anomagic trained on AnomVerse can synthesize more realistic and varied anomalies than prior methods, yielding superior improvements in downstream anomaly detection. Furthermore, Anomagic can generate anomalies for any normal-category image using user-defined prompts, establishing a versatile foundation model for anomaly generation.

*Feiyang Jia,Caiyan Jia,Ailin Liu,Shaoqing Xu,Qiming Xia,Lin Liu,Lei Yang,Yan Gong,Ziying Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DGFusion introduces a dual-guided paradigm for 3D object detection that addresses limitations of single-guided approaches by combining Point-guide-Image and Image-guide-Point paradigms to better handle hard instances (distant, small, occluded objects).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal 3D object detection methods use single-guided paradigms that fail to account for differences in information density between modalities for hard instances, compromising autonomous driving safety.

Method: Proposes DGFusion with Difficulty-aware Instance Pair Matcher (DIPM) that performs instance-level feature matching based on difficulty to generate easy/hard instance pairs, and Dual-guided Modules that exploit both pair types for effective multi-modal fusion.

Result: Outperforms baseline methods with +1.0% mAP, +0.8% NDS, and +1.3% average recall on nuScenes, with consistent robustness gains for hard instance detection across various scenarios.

Conclusion: The dual-guided paradigm effectively addresses hard instance detection challenges in 3D object detection, improving performance and robustness for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: As a critical task in autonomous driving perception systems, 3D object detection is used to identify and track key objects, such as vehicles and pedestrians. However, detecting distant, small, or occluded objects (hard instances) remains a challenge, which directly compromises the safety of autonomous driving systems. We observe that existing multi-modal 3D object detection methods often follow a single-guided paradigm, failing to account for the differences in information density of hard instances between modalities. In this work, we propose DGFusion, based on the Dual-guided paradigm, which fully inherits the advantages of the Point-guide-Image paradigm and integrates the Image-guide-Point paradigm to address the limitations of the single paradigms. The core of DGFusion, the Difficulty-aware Instance Pair Matcher (DIPM), performs instance-level feature matching based on difficulty to generate easy and hard instance pairs, while the Dual-guided Modules exploit the advantages of both pair types to enable effective multi-modal feature fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that our DGFusion outperforms the baseline methods, with respective improvements of +1.0\% mAP, +0.8\% NDS, and +1.3\% average recall on nuScenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent robustness gains for hard instance detection across ego-distance, size, visibility, and small-scale training scenarios.

TL;DR: A novel 3D VAE framework using unsigned distance fields (UDFs) with local-to-global architecture that achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction and generation at ultra-high resolutions up to 2048^3.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of existing 3D representations: SDFs require costly watertight preprocessing and struggle with non-manifold geometries, while point clouds suffer from sampling artifacts and surface discontinuities.

Method: 3D VAE built on UDFs with local-to-global architecture using UBlocks (uniform subvolumes), combining 3D convolutions for local detail and sparse transformers for global coherence, plus Pad-Average strategy for smooth boundary transitions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction accuracy and generative quality, with superior surface smoothness and geometric flexibility at resolutions up to 2048^3.

Conclusion: The proposed UDF-based 3D VAE with local-to-global architecture effectively handles complex topologies and enables ultra-high-resolution 3D content generation previously unattainable.

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity 3D contents remains a fundamental challenge due to the complexity of representing arbitrary topologies-such as open surfaces and intricate internal structures-while preserving geometric details. Prevailing methods based on signed distance fields (SDFs) are hampered by costly watertight preprocessing and struggle with non-manifold geometries, while point-cloud representations often suffer from sampling artifacts and surface discontinuities. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel 3D variational autoencoder (VAE) framework built upon unsigned distance fields (UDFs)-a more robust and computationally efficient representation that naturally handles complex and incomplete shapes. Our core innovation is a local-to-global (LoG) architecture that processes the UDF by partitioning it into uniform subvolumes, termed UBlocks. This architecture couples 3D convolutions for capturing local detail with sparse transformers for enforcing global coherence. A Pad-Average strategy further ensures smooth transitions at subvolume boundaries during reconstruction. This modular design enables seamless scaling to ultra-high resolutions up to 2048^3-a regime previously unattainable for 3D VAEs. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction accuracy and generative quality, yielding superior surface smoothness and geometric flexibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visible-infrared object detection methods suffer from information imbalance between modalities and inadequate cross-modal fusion, while most approaches ignore the potential of frequency domain transformers for mining complementary information.

Method: Proposes FreDFT with multimodal frequency domain attention (MFDA) to mine complementary information, frequency domain feed-forward layer (FDFFL) for mixed-scale feature fusion, cross-modal global modeling module (CGMM) for pixel-wise inter-modal interaction, and local feature enhancement module (LFEM) for multimodal local feature representation.

Result: Extensive experiments show FreDFT achieves excellent performance on multiple public datasets compared with state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed frequency domain fusion transformer effectively addresses modality imbalance and enhances cross-modal feature fusion for visible-infrared object detection.

Abstract: Visible-infrared object detection has gained sufficient attention due to its detection performance in low light, fog, and rain conditions. However, visible and infrared modalities captured by different sensors exist the information imbalance problem in complex scenarios, which can cause inadequate cross-modal fusion, resulting in degraded detection performance. \textcolor{red}{Furthermore, most existing methods use transformers in the spatial domain to capture complementary features, ignoring the advantages of developing frequency domain transformers to mine complementary information.} To solve these weaknesses, we propose a frequency domain fusion transformer, called FreDFT, for visible-infrared object detection. The proposed approach employs a novel multimodal frequency domain attention (MFDA) to mine complementary information between modalities and a frequency domain feed-forward layer (FDFFL) via a mixed-scale frequency feature fusion strategy is designed to better enhance multimodal features. To eliminate the imbalance of multimodal information, a cross-modal global modeling module (CGMM) is constructed to perform pixel-wise inter-modal feature interaction in a spatial and channel manner. Moreover, a local feature enhancement module (LFEM) is developed to strengthen multimodal local feature representation and promote multimodal feature fusion by using various convolution layers and applying a channel shuffle. Extensive experimental results have verified that our proposed FreDFT achieves excellent performance on multiple public datasets compared with other state-of-the-art methods.

*Xurui Li,Feng Xue,Yu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MuSc-V2 is a zero-shot anomaly classification and segmentation framework that leverages the observation that normal image patches have many similar neighbors in both 2D and 3D, while anomalies are isolated. It uses mutual scoring between samples and cross-modal fusion to achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook that normal patches across industrial products typically have many similar neighbors in both 2D appearance and 3D shapes, while anomalies remain diverse and isolated. This discriminative property can be leveraged for better anomaly detection.

Method: Proposes Mutual Scoring framework with: 1) Iterative Point Grouping for improved 3D representation, 2) Similarity Neighborhood Aggregation with Multi-Degrees for multi-scale patch features, 3) Mutual Scoring Mechanism for intra-modal scoring, 4) Cross-modal Anomaly Enhancement to fuse 2D/3D scores, and 5) Re-scoring with Constrained Neighborhood to suppress false positives.

Result: Achieves significant performance improvements: +23.7% AP gain on MVTec 3D-AD dataset and +19.3% boost on Eyecandies dataset, surpassing previous zero-shot benchmarks and outperforming most few-shot methods.

Conclusion: MuSc-V2 provides a flexible framework that works on both full datasets and smaller subsets, ensuring robust performance across diverse product lines. The mutual scoring approach effectively leverages neighborhood similarity patterns to distinguish anomalies from normal samples.

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly classification (AC) and segmentation (AS) methods aim to identify and outline defects without using any labeled samples. In this paper, we reveal a key property that is overlooked by existing methods: normal image patches across industrial products typically find many other similar patches, not only in 2D appearance but also in 3D shapes, while anomalies remain diverse and isolated. To explicitly leverage this discriminative property, we propose a Mutual Scoring framework (MuSc-V2) for zero-shot AC/AS, which flexibly supports single 2D/3D or multimodality. Specifically, our method begins by improving 3D representation through Iterative Point Grouping (IPG), which reduces false positives from discontinuous surfaces. Then we use Similarity Neighborhood Aggregation with Multi-Degrees (SNAMD) to fuse 2D/3D neighborhood cues into more discriminative multi-scale patch features for mutual scoring. The core comprises a Mutual Scoring Mechanism (MSM) that lets samples within each modality to assign score to each other, and Cross-modal Anomaly Enhancement (CAE) that fuses 2D and 3D scores to recover modality-specific missing anomalies. Finally, Re-scoring with Constrained Neighborhood (RsCon) suppresses false classification based on similarity to more representative samples. Our framework flexibly works on both the full dataset and smaller subsets with consistently robust performance, ensuring seamless adaptability across diverse product lines. In aid of the novel framework, MuSc-V2 achieves significant performance improvements: a $\textbf{+23.7\%}$ AP gain on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset and a $\textbf{+19.3\%}$ boost on the Eyecandies dataset, surpassing previous zero-shot benchmarks and even outperforming most few-shot methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses poor image screening performance in MLLMs by creating a large dataset (128k samples, 640k images) and proposing HCM-GRPO method with Hard Cases Mining and Dynamic Proportional Accuracy reward, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image screening performance with MLLMs is unsatisfactory due to lack of data and weak image aesthetic reasoning ability, with even top models performing at random guessing levels.

Method: Collected comprehensive dataset with four evaluation aspects; introduced HCM-GRPO method combining Hard Cases Mining strategy with Dynamic Proportional Accuracy reward in GRPO framework.

Result: HCM-GRPO surpasses both large-scale open-source and leading closed-source models (GPT4o, Qwen-VL-Max) with much smaller model, while baseline models perform akin to random guessing.

Conclusion: The proposed complete solution with dataset and HCM-GRPO method effectively addresses image screening challenges and significantly improves MLLMs' image aesthetic reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: The performance of image generation has been significantly improved in recent years. However, the study of image screening is rare and its performance with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is unsatisfactory due to the lack of data and the weak image aesthetic reasoning ability in MLLMs. In this work, we propose a complete solution to address these problems in terms of data and methodology. For data, we collect a comprehensive image screening dataset with over 128k samples, about 640k images. Each sample consists of an original image, four generated images. The dataset evaluates the image aesthetic reasoning ability under four aspects: appearance deformation, physical shadow, placement layout, and extension rationality. Regarding data annotation, we investigate multiple approaches, including purely manual, fully automated, and answer-driven annotations, to acquire high-quality chains of thought (CoT) data in the most cost-effective manner. Methodologically, we introduce a Hard Cases Mining (HCM) strategy with a Dynamic Proportional Accuracy (DPA) reward into the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework, called HCM-GRPO. This enhanced method demonstrates superior image aesthetic reasoning capabilities compared to the original GRPO. Our experimental results reveal that even state-of-the-art closed-source MLLMs, such as GPT4o and Qwen-VL-Max, exhibit performance akin to random guessing in image aesthetic reasoning. In contrast, by leveraging the HCM-GRPO, we are able to surpass the scores of both large-scale open-source and leading closed-source models with a much smaller model.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether MLLMs can identify confused objects that are visually present but audio-absent, and address the issue of visually dominated reasoning in current MLLMs.

Method: Introduces RL-CoMM with two stages: 1) Uses Large Audio Language Model as reference for audio-only reasoning with Step-wise Reasoning Reward for self-improvement, 2) Implements Answer-centered Confidence Optimization to reduce reasoning uncertainty.

Result: RL-CoMM improves accuracy by 10-30% over baseline models on audio-visual question answering and hallucination tasks with limited training data.

Conclusion: The proposed RL-CoMM framework effectively addresses audio-visual confusion in MLLMs by leveraging audio-only references and reinforcement learning, significantly improving performance on challenging audio-visual reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Can Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) discern confused objects that are visually present but audio-absent? To study this, we introduce a new benchmark, AV-ConfuseBench, which simulates an ``Audio-Visual Confusion'' scene by modifying the corresponding sound of an object in the video, e.g., mute the sounding object and ask MLLMs Is there a/an muted-object sound''. Experimental results reveal that MLLMs, such as Qwen2.5-Omni and Gemini 2.5, struggle to discriminate non-existent audio due to visually dominated reasoning. Motivated by this observation, we introduce RL-CoMM, a Reinforcement Learning-based Collaborative Multi-MLLM that is built upon the Qwen2.5-Omni foundation. RL-CoMM includes two stages: 1) To alleviate visually dominated ambiguities, we introduce an external model, a Large Audio Language Model (LALM), as the reference model to generate audio-only reasoning. Then, we design a Step-wise Reasoning Reward function that enables MLLMs to self-improve audio-visual reasoning with the audio-only reference. 2) To ensure an accurate answer prediction, we introduce Answer-centered Confidence Optimization to reduce the uncertainty of potential heterogeneous reasoning differences. Extensive experiments on audio-visual question answering and audio-visual hallucination show that RL-CoMM improves the accuracy by 10~30\% over the baseline model with limited training data.

Result: Achieves 92.1% Top-1 accuracy on the benchmark, outperforming ST-GCN baseline by +5.9% with only 10% FLOPs, and demonstrates superior robustness in cross-dataset experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed GaussMedAct framework effectively addresses medical action evaluation challenges through adaptive spatiotemporal representation learning and achieves state-of-the-art performance with computational efficiency.

Abstract: Fine-grained action evaluation in medical vision faces unique challenges due to the unavailability of comprehensive datasets, stringent precision requirements, and insufficient spatiotemporal dynamic modeling of very rapid actions. To support development and evaluation, we introduce CPREval-6k, a multi-view, multi-label medical action benchmark containing 6,372 expert-annotated videos with 22 clinical labels. Using this dataset, we present GaussMedAct, a multivariate Gaussian encoding framework, to advance medical motion analysis through adaptive spatiotemporal representation learning. Multivariate Gaussian Representation projects the joint motions to a temporally scaled multi-dimensional space, and decomposes actions into adaptive 3D Gaussians that serve as tokens. These tokens preserve motion semantics through anisotropic covariance modeling while maintaining robustness to spatiotemporal noise. Hybrid Spatial Encoding, employing a Cartesian and Vector dual-stream strategy, effectively utilizes skeletal information in the form of joint and bone features. The proposed method achieves 92.1% Top-1 accuracy with real-time inference on the benchmark, outperforming the ST-GCN baseline by +5.9% accuracy with only 10% FLOPs. Cross-dataset experiments confirm the superiority of our method in robustness.

TL;DR: CABIN is a semi-supervised framework that addresses overconfidence in hyperspectral image classification by incorporating uncertainty estimation, dual sampling, and dynamic assignment strategies to improve generalization under sparse annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional models in hyperspectral image classification mistake high confidence for correctness, leading to confirmation bias and poor generalization under sparse annotations or class imbalance.

Method: CABIN uses a closed-loop process: 1) perceptual awareness via epistemic uncertainty estimation, 2) uncertainty-guided dual sampling (exploring uncertain samples, anchoring confident ones), and 3) fine-grained dynamic assignment categorizing pseudo-labels into reliable/ambiguous/noisy subsets with tailored losses.

Result: Experimental results show that integrating CABIN improves labeling efficiency and performance across various state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CABIN effectively addresses overconfidence issues in hyperspectral image classification through cognitive-aware learning, enhancing model generalization and reducing confirmation bias.

Abstract: Confidence alone is often misleading in hyperspectral image classification, as models tend to mistake high predictive scores for correctness while lacking awareness of uncertainty. This leads to confirmation bias, especially under sparse annotations or class imbalance, where models overfit confident errors and fail to generalize. We propose CABIN (Cognitive-Aware Behavior-Informed learNing), a semi-supervised framework that addresses this limitation through a closed-loop learning process of perception, action, and correction. CABIN first develops perceptual awareness by estimating epistemic uncertainty, identifying ambiguous regions where errors are likely to occur. It then acts by adopting an Uncertainty-Guided Dual Sampling Strategy, selecting uncertain samples for exploration while anchoring confident ones as stable pseudo-labels to reduce bias. To correct noisy supervision, CABIN introduces a Fine-Grained Dynamic Assignment Strategy that categorizes pseudo-labeled data into reliable, ambiguous, and noisy subsets, applying tailored losses to enhance generalization. Experimental results show that a wide range of state-of-the-art methods benefit from the integration of CABIN, with improved labeling efficiency and performance.

TL;DR: VLF-MSC is a unified multimodal semantic communication system that transmits a single vision-language feature to generate both images and text at the receiver, improving spectral efficiency and robustness to channel noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic communication techniques process each modality separately, requiring multiple streams and reducing spectral efficiency. There is a need for a unified approach that can handle both vision and language modalities efficiently.

Method: Uses a pre-trained vision-language model to encode source images into vision-language semantic features (VLF), then transmits this single representation. At receiver, uses decoder-based language model and diffusion-based image generator both conditioned on VLF to produce text and images.

Result: Outperforms text-only and image-only baselines, achieving higher semantic accuracy for both modalities under low SNR with significantly reduced bandwidth requirements.

Conclusion: VLF-MSC provides an efficient unified framework for multimodal semantic communication that eliminates modality-specific streams while maintaining semantic fidelity and robustness to channel noise.

Abstract: We propose Vision-Language Feature-based Multimodal Semantic Communication (VLF-MSC), a unified system that transmits a single compact vision-language representation to support both image and text generation at the receiver. Unlike existing semantic communication techniques that process each modality separately, VLF-MSC employs a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to encode the source image into a vision-language semantic feature (VLF), which is transmitted over the wireless channel. At the receiver, a decoder-based language model and a diffusion-based image generator are both conditioned on the VLF to produce a descriptive text and a semantically aligned image. This unified representation eliminates the need for modality-specific streams or retransmissions, improving spectral efficiency and adaptability. By leveraging foundation models, the system achieves robustness to channel noise while preserving semantic fidelity. Experiments demonstrate that VLF-MSC outperforms text-only and image-only baselines, achieving higher semantic accuracy for both modalities under low SNR with significantly reduced bandwidth.

*Xiangyue Zhang,Jianfang Li,Jianqiang Ren,Jiaxu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GlobalDiff is a diffusion-based framework that generates co-speech motions using global joint rotations instead of local ones, avoiding hierarchical error accumulation through multi-level structural constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods using local joint rotations suffer from cumulative errors causing unstable motions at end-effectors due to hierarchical dependencies in skeleton structure.

Method: Proposes GlobalDiff framework operating in global joint rotation space with multi-level constraints: joint structure constraints using virtual anchor points, skeleton structure constraints for angular consistency, and temporal structure constraints with multi-scale variational encoder.

Result: Improves performance by 46.0% compared to state-of-the-art methods on standard co-speech benchmarks, generating smooth and accurate motions across multiple speaker identities.

Conclusion: Operating directly in global rotation space with structural constraints effectively addresses hierarchical error accumulation and generates more reliable co-speech motions.

Abstract: Reliable co-speech motion generation requires precise motion representation and consistent structural priors across all joints. Existing generative methods typically operate on local joint rotations, which are defined hierarchically based on the skeleton structure. This leads to cumulative errors during generation, manifesting as unstable and implausible motions at end-effectors. In this work, we propose GlobalDiff, a diffusion-based framework that operates directly in the space of global joint rotations for the first time, fundamentally decoupling each joint's prediction from upstream dependencies and alleviating hierarchical error accumulation. To compensate for the absence of structural priors in global rotation space, we introduce a multi-level constraint scheme. Specifically, a joint structure constraint introduces virtual anchor points around each joint to better capture fine-grained orientation. A skeleton structure constraint enforces angular consistency across bones to maintain structural integrity. A temporal structure constraint utilizes a multi-scale variational encoder to align the generated motion with ground-truth temporal patterns. These constraints jointly regularize the global diffusion process and reinforce structural awareness. Extensive evaluations on standard co-speech benchmarks show that GlobalDiff generates smooth and accurate motions, improving the performance by 46.0 % compared to the current SOTA under multiple speaker identities.

### [55] [GridPrune: From "Where to Look" to "What to Select" in Visual Token Pruning for MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10081)
*Yuxiang Duan,Ao Li,Yingqin Li,Luyu Li,Pengwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GridPrune is a visual token pruning method for MLLMs that uses a "guide-globally, select-locally" approach to efficiently allocate attention across spatial zones before fine-grained selection, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual token pruning methods focus only on "what to select" using attention scores, leading to inefficient spatial allocation, positional bias, and retention of irrelevant tokens. Human visual processing first determines "where to look" before "what to select".

Method: GridPrune splits pruning into two steps: (1) text-conditional guidance to dynamically allocate token budget across spatial zones, and (2) local selection within each budgeted zone, replacing global Top-K with zonal selection.

Result: On LLaVA-NeXT-7B, GridPrune retains 96.98% of full performance using only 11.1% of tokens, outperforming the best baseline by 2.34% at same pruning rate. Achieves superior performance across various MLLM architectures.

Conclusion: The two-stage "where to look" then "what to select" approach inspired by human visual processing effectively addresses computational inefficiency in MLLMs while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, the large number of visual tokens introduces significant computational overhead. To address this issue, visual token pruning has emerged as a key technique for enhancing the efficiency of MLLMs. In cognitive science, humans tend to first determine which regions of a scene to attend to ("where to look") before deciding which specific elements within those regions to process in detail ("what to select"). This two-stage strategy enables the visual system to efficiently allocate attention at a coarse spatial level before performing fine-grained selection. However, existing pruning methods primarily focus on directly optimizing "what to select", typically using attention scores or similarity metrics. They rarely consider "where to look", which has been shown to lead to inefficient spatial allocation, positional bias, and the retention of irrelevant or redundant tokens. In this paper, we propose GridPrune, a method that replaces the global Top-K mechanism with a "guide-globally, select-locally" zonal selection system. GridPrune splits the pruning process into two steps: first, it uses text-conditional guidance to dynamically allocate a token budget across spatial zones; and then, it performs local selection within each budgeted zone. Experimental results demonstrate that GridPrune achieves superior performance across various MLLM architectures. On LLaVA-NeXT-7B, GridPrune retains 96.98% of the full performance while using 11.1% of the tokens, outperforming the best-performing baseline by 2.34% at the same pruning rate.

TL;DR: SUGAR combines LLMs with skeleton data for action recognition by using video models to generate visual-motion knowledge, supervising skeleton learning to create discrete representations, and leveraging LLMs for classification and description.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable LLMs to understand skeleton data and distinguish between different actions for action classification and description tasks.

Method: SUGAR pipeline: 1) Use large-scale video models to generate visual-motion knowledge, 2) Supervise skeleton learning with prior knowledge to create discrete representations, 3) Employ LLMs with pre-trained weights to understand representations and generate outputs, 4) Introduce Temporal Query Projection module for long sequence modeling.

Result: Experiments show SUGAR achieves strong performance on skeleton-based action classification benchmarks and demonstrates better versatility than linear-based methods in zero-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: SUGAR effectively bridges LLMs with skeleton data for action recognition, providing a powerful framework that outperforms traditional methods and shows strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold rich implicit knowledge and powerful transferability. In this paper, we explore the combination of LLMs with the human skeleton to perform action classification and description. However, when treating LLM as a recognizer, two questions arise: 1) How can LLMs understand skeleton? 2) How can LLMs distinguish among actions? To address these problems, we introduce a novel paradigm named learning Skeleton representation with visUal-motion knowledGe for Action Recognition (SUGAR). In our pipeline, we first utilize off-the-shelf large-scale video models as a knowledge base to generate visual, motion information related to actions. Then, we propose to supervise skeleton learning through this prior knowledge to yield discrete representations. Finally, we use the LLM with untouched pre-training weights to understand these representations and generate the desired action targets and descriptions. Notably, we present a Temporal Query Projection (TQP) module to continuously model the skeleton signals with long sequences. Experiments on several skeleton-based action classification benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our SUGAR. Moreover, experiments on zero-shot scenarios show that SUGAR is more versatile than linear-based methods.

*Zihan Wang,Guansong Pang,Wenjun Miao,Jin Zheng,Xiao Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MTAttack is a novel multi-target backdoor attack framework for Large Visual Language Models that can embed multiple independent triggers with different attack targets in a single training pass, overcoming feature interference challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor attacks on LVLMs only focus on single-target attacks, but multi-target attacks pose greater real-world threats. The challenge is severe feature interference among different triggers that creates incorrect trigger-target mappings.

Method: Proposes MTAttack with two key constraints: Proxy Space Partitioning and Trigger Prototype Anchoring. It jointly optimizes multiple triggers in latent space, mapping each trigger to unique proxy classes while ensuring their separability.

Result: Experiments show high success rate for multi-target attacks, substantially outperforming existing methods. The attack exhibits strong generalizability across datasets and robustness against defense strategies.

Conclusion: LVLMs are vulnerable to multi-target backdoor attacks, highlighting urgent need for mitigation strategies. The proposed MTAttack framework effectively demonstrates this vulnerability.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various vision-language tasks by leveraging large-scale image-text pretraining and instruction tuning. However, the security vulnerabilities of LVLMs have become increasingly concerning, particularly their susceptibility to backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks focus on single-target attacks, i.e., targeting a single malicious output associated with a specific trigger. In this work, we uncover multi-target backdoor attacks, where multiple independent triggers corresponding to different attack targets are added in a single pass of training, posing a greater threat to LVLMs in real-world applications. Executing such attacks in LVLMs is challenging since there can be many incorrect trigger-target mappings due to severe feature interference among different triggers. To address this challenge, we propose MTAttack, the first multi-target backdoor attack framework for enforcing accurate multiple trigger-target mappings in LVLMs. The core of MTAttack is a novel optimization method with two constraints, namely Proxy Space Partitioning constraint and Trigger Prototype Anchoring constraint. It jointly optimizes multiple triggers in the latent space, with each trigger independently mapping clean images to a unique proxy class while at the same time guaranteeing their separability. Experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate a high success rate of MTAttack for multi-target attacks, substantially outperforming existing attack methods. Furthermore, our attack exhibits strong generalizability across datasets and robustness against backdoor defense strategies. These findings highlight the vulnerability of LVLMs to multi-target backdoor attacks and underscore the urgent need for mitigating such threats.

TL;DR: RobIA is a robust, instance-aware framework for continual test-time adaptation in stereo depth estimation that dynamically adapts to domain shifts using parameter-efficient modules and pseudo-supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stereo depth estimation faces challenges from dynamic domain shifts, sparse supervision, and high costs of dense ground-truth labels. Existing TTA methods have limited effectiveness under continual shifts due to static assumptions and input-invariant strategies.

Method: RobIA integrates two components: (1) Attend-and-Excite Mixture-of-Experts (AttEx-MoE) that dynamically routes inputs to frozen experts using lightweight self-attention tailored to epipolar geometry, and (2) Robust AdaptBN Teacher that provides dense pseudo-supervision by complementing sparse handcrafted labels.

Result: Extensive experiments show RobIA achieves superior adaptation performance across dynamic target domains while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: RobIA enables input-specific flexibility and broad supervision coverage, improving generalization under domain shift for stereo depth estimation.

Abstract: Stereo Depth Estimation in real-world environments poses significant challenges due to dynamic domain shifts, sparse or unreliable supervision, and the high cost of acquiring dense ground-truth labels. While recent Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods offer promising solutions, most rely on static target domain assumptions and input-invariant adaptation strategies, limiting their effectiveness under continual shifts. In this paper, we propose RobIA, a novel Robust, Instance-Aware framework for Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) in stereo depth estimation. RobIA integrates two key components: (1) Attend-and-Excite Mixture-of-Experts (AttEx-MoE), a parameter-efficient module that dynamically routes input to frozen experts via lightweight self-attention mechanism tailored to epipolar geometry, and (2) Robust AdaptBN Teacher, a PEFT-based teacher model that provides dense pseudo-supervision by complementing sparse handcrafted labels. This strategy enables input-specific flexibility, broad supervision coverage, improving generalization under domain shift. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RobIA achieves superior adaptation performance across dynamic target domains while maintaining computational efficiency.

TL;DR: CACMI is a novel framework for dense video captioning that explicitly models temporal coherence and semantic context through cross-modal interactions, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use implicit modeling with frame-level features, failing to capture temporal coherence across event sequences and comprehensive visual semantics.

Method: Proposes Context-Aware Cross-Modal Interaction (CACMI) with two components: Cross-modal Frame Aggregation for event-aligned textual features, and Context-aware Feature Enhancement integrating visual dynamics with pseudo-event semantics.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ActivityNet Captions and YouCook2 datasets for dense video captioning.

Conclusion: Explicit temporal-semantic modeling through cross-modal interactions effectively addresses limitations of implicit modeling in dense video captioning.

Abstract: Dense video captioning jointly localizes and captions salient events in untrimmed videos. Recent methods primarily focus on leveraging additional prior knowledge and advanced multi-task architectures to achieve competitive performance. However, these pipelines rely on implicit modeling that uses frame-level or fragmented video features, failing to capture the temporal coherence across event sequences and comprehensive semantics within visual contexts. To address this, we propose an explicit temporal-semantic modeling framework called Context-Aware Cross-Modal Interaction (CACMI), which leverages both latent temporal characteristics within videos and linguistic semantics from text corpus. Specifically, our model consists of two core components: Cross-modal Frame Aggregation aggregates relevant frames to extract temporally coherent, event-aligned textual features through cross-modal retrieval; and Context-aware Feature Enhancement utilizes query-guided attention to integrate visual dynamics with pseudo-event semantics. Extensive experiments on the ActivityNet Captions and YouCook2 datasets demonstrate that CACMI achieves the state-of-the-art performance on dense video captioning task.

*Mayank Vatsa,Aparna Bharati,Richa Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Text-to-image models fail at logical composition (negation, counting, spatial relations), showing dramatic performance collapse when primitives are combined due to training data gaps, unsuitable architectures, and flawed evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the fundamental flaw in current text-to-image models: their inability to handle logical composition, which limits their practical utility despite impressive single-task performance.

Method: Survey analysis across three core logical primitives (negation, counting, spatial relations), examining training data distribution, architectural limitations of continuous attention models, and evaluation metric biases.

Result: Models show dramatic performance collapse when logical primitives are combined, with severe interference effects. Training data lacks explicit negations, architectures are unsuitable for discrete logic, and metrics reward visual plausibility over constraint satisfaction.

Conclusion: Achieving genuine compositionality requires fundamental advances in representation and reasoning, not incremental adjustments to existing architectures or simple scaling.

Abstract: The architectural blueprint of today's leading text-to-image models contains a fundamental flaw: an inability to handle logical composition. This survey investigates this breakdown across three core primitives-negation, counting, and spatial relations. Our analysis reveals a dramatic performance collapse: models that are accurate on single primitives fail precipitously when these are combined, exposing severe interference. We trace this failure to three key factors. First, training data show a near-total absence of explicit negations. Second, continuous attention architectures are fundamentally unsuitable for discrete logic. Third, evaluation metrics reward visual plausibility over constraint satisfaction. By analyzing recent benchmarks and methods, we show that current solutions and simple scaling cannot bridge this gap. Achieving genuine compositionality, we conclude, will require fundamental advances in representation and reasoning rather than incremental adjustments to existing architectures.

*Zhicheng Cai,Hao Zhu,Linsen Chen,Qiu Shen,Xun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a split-layer MLP architecture that enhances implicit neural representation (INR) capacity by dividing layers into parallel branches and combining outputs via Hadamard product, creating high-degree polynomial spaces without quadratic computational cost growth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional MLP architectures in INR have limited representational capacity due to low-dimensional feature spaces, and widening MLPs leads to quadratic computational/memory cost increases, creating a fundamental limitation.

Method: Proposed split-layer MLP that divides each layer into multiple parallel branches and integrates their outputs using Hadamard product, effectively constructing high-degree polynomial spaces to expand feature dimensionality.

Result: Extensive experiments show split-layer significantly improves INR performance, surpassing existing methods in 2D image fitting, 2D CT reconstruction, 3D shape representation, and 5D novel view synthesis tasks.

Conclusion: The split-layer architecture successfully enhances INR's representational capacity without prohibitive computational overhead, offering an effective solution to the limitations of conventional MLP-based INR approaches.

Abstract: Implicit neural representation (INR) models signals as continuous functions using neural networks, offering efficient and differentiable optimization for inverse problems across diverse disciplines. However, the representational capacity of INR defined by the range of functions the neural network can characterize, is inherently limited by the low-dimensional feature space in conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP) architectures. While widening the MLP can linearly increase feature space dimensionality, it also leads to a quadratic growth in computational and memory costs. To address this limitation, we propose the split-layer, a novel reformulation of MLP construction. The split-layer divides each layer into multiple parallel branches and integrates their outputs via Hadamard product, effectively constructing a high-degree polynomial space. This approach significantly enhances INR's representational capacity by expanding the feature space dimensionality without incurring prohibitive computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the split-layer substantially improves INR performance, surpassing existing methods across multiple tasks, including 2D image fitting, 2D CT reconstruction, 3D shape representation, and 5D novel view synthesis.

*Feng Ding,Wenhui Yi,Yunpeng Zhou,Xinan He,Hong Rao,Shu Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a dual-mechanism framework for fair deepfake detection that maintains accuracy while improving fairness across demographic groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fairness-enhanced detectors sacrifice detection accuracy to improve fairness, creating a trade-off that limits practical deployment in digital identity security.

Method: Integrates structural fairness decoupling (demographic-sensitive channel separation) and global distribution alignment (reducing distance between overall and demographic-specific feature distributions).

Result: Experimental results show improved inter-group and intra-group fairness while maintaining overall detection accuracy across domains compared to other methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the fairness-accuracy trade-off in deepfake detection, enabling more equitable deployment in digital identity security applications.

Abstract: Fairness is a core element in the trustworthy deployment of deepfake detection models, especially in the field of digital identity security. Biases in detection models toward different demographic groups, such as gender and race, may lead to systemic misjudgments, exacerbating the digital divide and social inequities. However, current fairness-enhanced detectors often improve fairness at the cost of detection accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose a dual-mechanism collaborative optimization framework. Our proposed method innovatively integrates structural fairness decoupling and global distribution alignment: decoupling channels sensitive to demographic groups at the model architectural level, and subsequently reducing the distance between the overall sample distribution and the distributions corresponding to each demographic group at the feature level. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with other methods, our framework improves both inter-group and intra-group fairness while maintaining overall detection accuracy across domains.

*Hao Zou,Runqing Zhang,Xue Zhou,Jianxiao Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GEA proposes a generative approach for text-to-image person retrieval using diffusion-generated images as intermediate representations to bridge the modality gap between text and images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Textual queries often fail to accurately reflect image content, leading to poor cross-modal alignment and overfitting. The inherent modality gap between text and image makes accurate retrieval challenging.

Method: Two parallel modules: Text-Guided Token Enhancement (TGTE) uses diffusion-generated images as intermediate semantic representations, and Generative Intermediate Fusion (GIF) combines cross-attention between generated images, original images, and text features with triplet alignment loss.

Result: Extensive experiments on CUHK-PEDES, RSTPReid, and ICFG-PEDES datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: GEA successfully addresses cross-modal alignment challenges in text-to-image person retrieval by leveraging generative approaches to bridge the modality gap.

Abstract: Text-to-Image Person Retrieval (TIPR) aims to retrieve person images based on natural language descriptions. Although many TIPR methods have achieved promising results, sometimes textual queries cannot accurately and comprehensively reflect the content of the image, leading to poor cross-modal alignment and overfitting to limited datasets. Moreover, the inherent modality gap between text and image further amplifies these issues, making accurate cross-modal retrieval even more challenging. To address these limitations, we propose the Generation-Enhanced Alignment (GEA) from a generative perspective. GEA contains two parallel modules: (1) Text-Guided Token Enhancement (TGTE), which introduces diffusion-generated images as intermediate semantic representations to bridge the gap between text and visual patterns. These generated images enrich the semantic representation of text and facilitate cross-modal alignment. (2) Generative Intermediate Fusion (GIF), which combines cross-attention between generated images, original images, and text features to generate a unified representation optimized by triplet alignment loss. We conduct extensive experiments on three public TIPR datasets, CUHK-PEDES, RSTPReid, and ICFG-PEDES, to evaluate the performance of GEA. The results justify the effectiveness of our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes InterIR, an interpretability-driven deep unfolding network for multi-degradation image restoration that handles multiple degradations simultaneously while maintaining clear physical interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world images often contain multiple degradations simultaneously (rain, noise, haze), but most existing methods target only single degradation types. Additionally, stacked module approaches suffer from limited interpretability.

Method: Uses a deep unfolding network based on an improved second-order semi-smooth Newton algorithm, with explainable convolution modules inspired by human brain information processing and image characteristics for flexible parameter adjustment.

Result: InterIR demonstrates excellent performance in multi-degradation restoration while remaining highly competitive on single-degradation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed interpretability-driven approach successfully addresses multi-degradation image restoration with clear physical interpretability and strong performance across both multi-degradation and single-degradation scenarios.

Abstract: Although image restoration has advanced significantly, most existing methods target only a single type of degradation. In real-world scenarios, images often contain multiple degradations simultaneously, such as rain, noise, and haze, requiring models capable of handling diverse degradation types. Moreover, methods that improve performance through module stacking often suffer from limited interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretability-driven approach for multi-degradation image restoration, built upon a deep unfolding network that maps the iterative process of a mathematical optimization algorithm into a learnable network structure. Specifically, we employ an improved second-order semi-smooth Newton algorithm to ensure that each module maintains clear physical interpretability. To further enhance interpretability and adaptability, we design an explainable convolution module inspired by the human brain's flexible information processing and the intrinsic characteristics of images, allowing the network to flexibly leverage learned knowledge and autonomously adjust parameters for different input. The resulting tightly integrated architecture, named InterIR, demonstrates excellent performance in multi-degradation restoration while remaining highly competitive on single-degradation tasks.

Abstract: Accurate localization of cephalometric landmarks from 2D lateral skull X-rays is vital for orthodontic diagnosis and treatment. Manual annotation is time-consuming and error-prone, whereas automated approaches often struggle with low contrast and anatomical complexity. This paper introduces CephRes-MHNet, a multi-head residual convolutional network for robust and efficient cephalometric landmark detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to jointly capture agents' long-term goals and fine-grained social interactions, leading to unrealistic multi-agent futures in dense, interactive environments.

Method: VISTA uses a cross-attention fusion module for intent-motion integration, social-token attention for flexible interaction modeling, and pairwise attention maps for interpretable social influence patterns, turning single-agent goal-conditioned prediction into coherent multi-agent forecasting.

Result: On MADRAS benchmark, VISTA reduces average collision rate from 2.14% to 0.03%, and on SDD achieves zero collisions while improving ADE, FDE, and minFDE metrics.

Conclusion: VISTA generates socially compliant, goal-aware, and interpretable trajectories, making it promising for safety-critical autonomous systems.

Abstract: Multi-agent trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous systems operating in dense, interactive environments. Existing methods often fail to jointly capture agents' long-term goals and their fine-grained social interactions, which leads to unrealistic multi-agent futures. We propose VISTA, a recursive goal-conditioned transformer for multi-agent trajectory forecasting. VISTA combines (i) a cross-attention fusion module that integrates long-horizon intent with past motion, (ii) a social-token attention mechanism for flexible interaction modeling across agents, and (iii) pairwise attention maps that make social influence patterns interpretable at inference time. Our model turns single-agent goal-conditioned prediction into a coherent multi-agent forecasting framework. Beyond standard displacement metrics, we evaluate trajectory collision rates as a measure of joint realism. On the high-density MADRAS benchmark and on SDD, VISTA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and substantially fewer collisions. On MADRAS, it reduces the average collision rate of strong baselines from 2.14 to 0.03 percent, and on SDD it attains zero collisions while improving ADE, FDE, and minFDE. These results show that VISTA generates socially compliant, goal-aware, and interpretable trajectories, making it promising for safety-critical autonomous systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous diffusion-based methods for LiDAR scene completion suffer from high computational overhead due to multi-step iterative sampling, limiting real-time applicability in autonomous vehicles.

Method: LiNeXt uses a Noise-to-Coarse (N2C) Module for single-pass denoising instead of iterative sampling, followed by a Refine Module for precise refinement. It also employs Distance-aware Selected Repeat strategy to handle LiDAR's distance-dependent spatial distribution.

Result: On SemanticKITTI dataset, LiNeXt achieves 199.8x inference speedup, reduces Chamfer Distance by 50.7%, and uses only 6.1% of parameters compared to LiDiff.

Conclusion: LiNeXt demonstrates superior efficiency and effectiveness for real-time LiDAR scene completion, making it suitable for autonomous vehicle perception systems.

Abstract: 3D LiDAR scene completion from point clouds is a fundamental component of perception systems in autonomous vehicles. Previous methods have predominantly employed diffusion models for high-fidelity reconstruction. However, their multi-step iterative sampling incurs significant computational overhead, limiting its real-time applicability. To address this, we propose LiNeXt-a lightweight, non-diffusion network optimized for rapid and accurate point cloud completion. Specifically, LiNeXt first applies the Noise-to-Coarse (N2C) Module to denoise the input noisy point cloud in a single pass, thereby obviating the multi-step iterative sampling of diffusion-based methods. The Refine Module then takes the coarse point cloud and its intermediate features from the N2C Module to perform more precise refinement, further enhancing structural completeness. Furthermore, we observe that LiDAR point clouds exhibit a distance-dependent spatial distribution, being densely sampled at proximal ranges and sparsely sampled at distal ranges. Accordingly, we propose the Distance-aware Selected Repeat strategy to generate a more uniformly distributed noisy point cloud. On the SemanticKITTI dataset, LiNeXt achieves a 199.8x speedup in inference, reduces Chamfer Distance by 50.7%, and uses only 6.1% of the parameters compared with LiDiff. These results demonstrate the superior efficiency and effectiveness of LiNeXt for real-time scene completion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing V2X frameworks struggle with multi-modal heterogeneous agents and lack scalability for accommodating new agents, requiring effective cross-agent feature alignment and scalable adaptation.

Method: Uses heterogeneous graph attention to train a foundation agent, then applies Local Heterogeneous Fine-Tuning with Hetero-Aware Adapters and Global Collaborative Fine-Tuning with Multi-Cognitive Adapter for alignment and interaction.

Result: Achieves superior perception performance on OPV2V-H and DAIR-V2X datasets with significantly reduced training overhead, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: HeatV2X enables substantial performance improvement in collaborative perception with minimal training cost, effectively solving heterogeneity and scalability challenges in V2X systems.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) collaborative perception extends sensing beyond single vehicle limits through transmission. However, as more agents participate, existing frameworks face two key challenges: (1) the participating agents are inherently multi-modal and heterogeneous, and (2) the collaborative framework must be scalable to accommodate new agents. The former requires effective cross-agent feature alignment to mitigate heterogeneity loss, while the latter renders full-parameter training impractical, highlighting the importance of scalable adaptation. To address these issues, we propose Heterogeneous Adaptation (HeatV2X), a scalable collaborative framework. We first train a high-performance agent based on heterogeneous graph attention as the foundation for collaborative learning. Then, we design Local Heterogeneous Fine-Tuning and Global Collaborative Fine-Tuning to achieve effective alignment and interaction among heterogeneous agents. The former efficiently extracts modality-specific differences using Hetero-Aware Adapters, while the latter employs the Multi-Cognitive Adapter to enhance cross-agent collaboration and fully exploit the fusion potential. These designs enable substantial performance improvement of the collaborative framework with minimal training cost. We evaluate our approach on the OPV2V-H and DAIR-V2X datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior perception performance with significantly reduced training overhead, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches. Our implementation will be released soon.

Motivation: Existing multimodal deepfake detection methods struggle with generalization across unseen manipulations, require pretraining on real samples, and may fail against manipulations that preserve audio-visual alignment by focusing only on cross-modal inconsistencies.

Method: Proposes a single-stage training framework with next-frame prediction for both uni-modal and cross-modal features, plus a window-level attention mechanism to capture discrepancies between predicted and actual frames for detecting local artifacts.

Result: The model demonstrates strong generalization across multiple benchmark datasets and achieves precise temporal localization of deepfake segments in partially spoofed videos.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by enabling single-stage training without pretraining requirements while maintaining strong generalization and accurate temporal localization capabilities.

Abstract: Recent multimodal deepfake detection methods designed for generalization conjecture that single-stage supervised training struggles to generalize across unseen manipulations and datasets. However, such approaches that target generalization require pretraining over real samples. Additionally, these methods primarily focus on detecting audio-visual inconsistencies and may overlook intra-modal artifacts causing them to fail against manipulations that preserve audio-visual alignment. To address these limitations, we propose a single-stage training framework that enhances generalization by incorporating next-frame prediction for both uni-modal and cross-modal features. Additionally, we introduce a window-level attention mechanism to capture discrepancies between predicted and actual frames, enabling the model to detect local artifacts around every frame, which is crucial for accurately classifying fully manipulated videos and effectively localizing deepfake segments in partially spoofed samples. Our model, evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrates strong generalization and precise temporal localization.

TL;DR: TubeRMC is a novel framework for weakly-supervised spatio-temporal video grounding that generates text-conditioned candidate tubes and refines them through tube-conditioned reconstruction with spatio-temporal constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of existing weakly-supervised STVG methods that use simple late-fusion and generate tubes independent of text descriptions, leading to failed target identification and inconsistent tracking.

Method: Proposes Tube-conditioned Reconstruction with Mutual Constraints (TubeRMC) that: 1) generates text-conditioned candidate tubes using pre-trained visual grounding models, 2) refines tubes via three reconstruction strategies (temporal, spatial, spatio-temporal) with Tube-conditioned Reconstructors, and 3) applies mutual constraints between spatial and temporal proposals.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on VidSTG and HCSTVG benchmarks. Visualization shows effective mitigation of target identification errors and inconsistent tracking.

Conclusion: TubeRMC successfully addresses the limitations of previous weakly-supervised STVG approaches by incorporating text-conditioned tube generation and comprehensive reconstruction strategies with mutual constraints.

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG) aims to localize a spatio-temporal tube that corresponds to a given language query in an untrimmed video. This is a challenging task since it involves complex vision-language understanding and spatiotemporal reasoning. Recent works have explored weakly-supervised setting in STVG to eliminate reliance on fine-grained annotations like bounding boxes or temporal stamps. However, they typically follow a simple late-fusion manner, which generates tubes independent of the text description, often resulting in failed target identification and inconsistent target tracking. To address this limitation, we propose a Tube-conditioned Reconstruction with Mutual Constraints (\textbf{TubeRMC}) framework that generates text-conditioned candidate tubes with pre-trained visual grounding models and further refine them via tube-conditioned reconstruction with spatio-temporal constraints. Specifically, we design three reconstruction strategies from temporal, spatial, and spatio-temporal perspectives to comprehensively capture rich tube-text correspondences. Each strategy is equipped with a Tube-conditioned Reconstructor, utilizing spatio-temporal tubes as condition to reconstruct the key clues in the query. We further introduce mutual constraints between spatial and temporal proposals to enhance their quality for reconstruction. TubeRMC outperforms existing methods on two public benchmarks VidSTG and HCSTVG. Further visualization shows that TubeRMC effectively mitigates both target identification errors and inconsistent tracking.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes JudgeMind, a novel AQA method that simulates professional referees' scoring mindset by segmenting actions into stages, using stage-aware feature enhancement, and incorporating deduction knowledge for more accurate and reliable sports action scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AQA methods lack interpretability and reliability by predicting scores from entire videos, and current datasets lack fine-grained annotations for deduction items and sub-scores.

Method: Segments action videos into stages, uses stage-aware feature enhancement and fusion to handle viewpoint changes, and employs a knowledge-based grade-aware decoder with deduction items as prior knowledge.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on the new aerial skiing benchmark dataset with fine-grained sub-score and deduction annotations.

Conclusion: JudgeMind significantly enhances AQA performance and reliability by mimicking professional referees' judgment process through stage segmentation and deduction knowledge incorporation.

Abstract: Action Quality Assessment (AQA) aims to evaluate and score sports actions, which has attracted widespread interest in recent years. Existing AQA methods primarily predict scores based on features extracted from the entire video, resulting in limited interpretability and reliability. Meanwhile, existing AQA datasets also lack fine-grained annotations for action scores, especially for deduction items and sub-score annotations. In this paper, we construct the first AQA dataset containing fine-grained sub-score and deduction annotations for aerial skiing, which will be released as a new benchmark. For the technical challenges, we propose a novel AQA method, named JudgeMind, which significantly enhances performance and reliability by simulating the judgment and scoring mindset of professional referees. Our method segments the input action video into different stages and scores each stage to enhance accuracy. Then, we propose a stage-aware feature enhancement and fusion module to boost the perception of stage-specific key regions and enhance the robustness to visual changes caused by frequent camera viewpoints switching. In addition, we propose a knowledge-based grade-aware decoder to incorporate possible deduction items as prior knowledge to predict more accurate and reliable scores. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Facial-R1 is a three-stage alignment framework that addresses hallucinated reasoning and misalignment in facial emotion analysis by combining instruction fine-tuning, reinforcement training with emotion/AU rewards, and iterative data synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM-based approaches for facial emotion analysis suffer from hallucinated reasoning (generating plausible but inaccurate explanations) and misalignment between emotion reasoning and recognition due to fragmented connections between facial features and labels.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) Instruction fine-tuning for basic emotional reasoning, 2) Reinforcement training guided by emotion and AU labels as rewards to align reasoning with predictions, 3) Data synthesis pipeline that iteratively expands training data for scalable self-improvement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across eight standard benchmarks, with strong generalization and robust interpretability. Introduces FEA-20K dataset with 17,737 training and 1,688 test samples.

Conclusion: Facial-R1 effectively addresses key limitations in facial emotion analysis by aligning reasoning with recognition through minimal supervision, demonstrating superior performance and interpretability.

Abstract: Facial Emotion Analysis (FEA) extends traditional facial emotion recognition by incorporating explainable, fine-grained reasoning. The task integrates three subtasks: emotion recognition, facial Action Unit (AU) recognition, and AU-based emotion reasoning to model affective states jointly. While recent approaches leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and achieve promising results, they face two critical limitations: (1) hallucinated reasoning, where VLMs generate plausible but inaccurate explanations due to insufficient emotion-specific knowledge; and (2) misalignment between emotion reasoning and recognition, caused by fragmented connections between observed facial features and final labels. We propose Facial-R1, a three-stage alignment framework that effectively addresses both challenges with minimal supervision. First, we employ instruction fine-tuning to establish basic emotional reasoning capability. Second, we introduce reinforcement training guided by emotion and AU labels as reward signals, which explicitly aligns the generated reasoning process with the predicted emotion. Third, we design a data synthesis pipeline that iteratively leverages the prior stages to expand the training dataset, enabling scalable self-improvement of the model. Built upon this framework, we introduce FEA-20K, a benchmark dataset comprising 17,737 training and 1,688 test samples with fine-grained emotion analysis annotations. Extensive experiments across eight standard benchmarks demonstrate that Facial-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance in FEA, with strong generalization and robust interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FGVC methods fail to comprehensively capture discriminative cues and introduce category-agnostic redundancy, limiting their effectiveness in handling subtle inter-class differences and large intra-class variations.

Method: Proposes Semantic-Aware Aggregation Module (SAAM) using hypergraph convolution to capture high-order semantic dependencies and aggregate token features into region-level representations, plus Hyperbolic Hierarchical Contrastive Loss (HHCL) for hierarchical semantic constraints in non-Euclidean space.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on four standard FGVC benchmarks validate the superiority of the H3Former framework over existing approaches.

Conclusion: H3Former effectively addresses limitations of previous FGVC methods by leveraging high-order semantic relations and hyperbolic hierarchical constraints, achieving superior performance in fine-grained visual classification.

Abstract: Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) remains a challenging task due to subtle inter-class differences and large intra-class variations. Existing approaches typically rely on feature-selection mechanisms or region-proposal strategies to localize discriminative regions for semantic analysis. However, these methods often fail to capture discriminative cues comprehensively while introducing substantial category-agnostic redundancy. To address these limitations, we propose H3Former, a novel token-to-region framework that leverages high-order semantic relations to aggregate local fine-grained representations with structured region-level modeling. Specifically, we propose the Semantic-Aware Aggregation Module (SAAM), which exploits multi-scale contextual cues to dynamically construct a weighted hypergraph among tokens. By applying hypergraph convolution, SAAM captures high-order semantic dependencies and progressively aggregates token features into compact region-level representations. Furthermore, we introduce the Hyperbolic Hierarchical Contrastive Loss (HHCL), which enforces hierarchical semantic constraints in a non-Euclidean embedding space. The HHCL enhances inter-class separability and intra-class consistency while preserving the intrinsic hierarchical relationships among fine-grained categories. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four standard FGVC benchmarks validate the superiority of our H3Former framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PROPA is a novel framework that combines Monte Carlo Tree Search with GRPO to provide dense process-level rewards for optimizing visual reasoning in VLMs without human annotations, achieving significant performance gains on complex reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models struggle with complex visual reasoning where early errors cascade through multi-step reasoning chains. Existing methods either require costly step-level annotations (SFT) or provide only sparse outcome-level feedback (RLVR), limiting stable optimization.

Method: PROPA integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search with GRPO to generate dense process-level rewards, interleaves GRPO updates with SFT to overcome cold-start problems, and trains a Process Reward Model to guide inference-time search. This enables optimization at each intermediate reasoning step without human annotations.

Result: Across seven benchmarks and four VLM backbones, PROPA consistently outperforms both SFT- and RLVR-based baselines, achieving up to 17.0% gains on in-domain tasks and 21.0% gains on out-of-domain tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: PROPA establishes strong reasoning and generalization capabilities for visual reasoning tasks by providing dense process-level optimization without human supervision, significantly advancing complex visual reasoning in VLMs.

Abstract: Despite significant progress, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) still struggle with complex visual reasoning, where multi-step dependencies cause early errors to cascade through the reasoning chain. Existing post-training paradigms are limited: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) relies on costly step-level annotations, while Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods like GRPO provide only sparse, outcome-level feedback, hindering stable optimization. We introduce PROPA (Process-level Reasoning Optimization with interleaved Policy Alignment), a novel framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with GRPO to generate dense, process-level rewards and optimize reasoning at each intermediate step without human annotations. To overcome the cold-start problem, PROPA interleaves GRPO updates with SFT, enabling the model to learn from both successful and failed reasoning trajectories. A Process Reward Model (PRM) is further trained to guide inference-time search, aligning the test-time search with the training signal. Across seven benchmarks and four VLM backbones, PROPA consistently outperforms both SFT- and RLVR-based baselines. It achieves up to 17.0% gains on in-domain tasks and 21.0% gains on out-of-domain tasks compared to existing state-of-the-art, establishing a strong reasoning and generalization capability for visual reasoning tasks.

*Zhengtao Zou,Ya Gao,Jiarui Guan,Bin Li,Pekka Marttinen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RUDDER is an efficient framework that reduces object hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models by using visual evidence vectors extracted during standard forward passes and adaptive token-wise injection, achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods to mitigate object hallucination in LVLMs suffer from substantial computational overhead, typically requiring extra forward passes, which limits their practicality for real-world, latency-sensitive deployments.

Method: RUDDER uses two key innovations: (1) Contextual Activation Residual Direction (CARD) vector - a per-sample visual evidence vector extracted from residual updates during a single forward pass, and (2) A Bayesian-inspired adaptive gate for token-wise injection that applies corrective signals based on the model's deviation from visual context.

Result: Extensive experiments on hallucination benchmarks (POPE and CHAIR) show RUDDER achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while introducing negligible computational latency.

Conclusion: RUDDER provides a pragmatic and effective approach for improving LVLMs' reliability without significant efficiency compromise, making it suitable for real-world deployments.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often suffer from object hallucination, generating text inconsistent with visual inputs, which can critically undermine their reliability. Existing inference-time interventions to mitigate this issue present a challenging trade-off: while methods that steer internal states or adjust output logits can be effective, they often incur substantial computational overhead, typically requiring extra forward passes. This efficiency bottleneck can limit their practicality for real-world, latency-sensitive deployments. In this work, we aim to address this trade-off with Residual-Update Directed DEcoding Regulation (RUDDER), a low-overhead framework that steers LVLMs towards visually-grounded generation. RUDDER is built on two key innovations: (1) Contextual Activation Residual Direction (CARD) vector, a per-sample visual evidence vector extracted from the residual update of a self-attention layer during a single, standard forward pass. (2) A Bayesian-inspired adaptive gate that performs token-wise injection, applying a corrective signal whose strength is conditioned on the model's deviation from the visual context. Extensive experiments on key hallucination benchmarks, including POPE and CHAIR, indicate that RUDDER achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while introducing negligible computational latency, validating RUDDER as a pragmatic and effective approach for improving LVLMs' reliability without a significant compromise on efficiency.

TL;DR: GRAM is a two-phase test-time adaptation framework for robust slum segmentation that uses Mixture-of-Experts architecture and prediction consistency filtering to generalize to unseen regions without requiring target region labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Satellite-based slum segmentation can generate global urban poverty estimates, but morphological heterogeneity of informal settlements prevents models from generalizing effectively across different regions.

Method: Two-phase test-time adaptation framework with Mixture-of-Experts architecture that captures region-specific slum characteristics while learning universal features through shared backbone; uses prediction consistency across experts to filter unreliable pseudo-labels during adaptation.

Result: GRAM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in low-resource settings like African cities, using a million-scale satellite imagery dataset from 12 cities across four continents.

Conclusion: GRAM provides a scalable and label-efficient solution for global slum mapping and data-driven urban planning by enabling robust slum segmentation without requiring labeled data from target regions.

Abstract: Satellite-based slum segmentation holds significant promise in generating global estimates of urban poverty. However, the morphological heterogeneity of informal settlements presents a major challenge, hindering the ability of models trained on specific regions to generalize effectively to unseen locations. To address this, we introduce a large-scale high-resolution dataset and propose GRAM (Generalized Region-Aware Mixture-of-Experts), a two-phase test-time adaptation framework that enables robust slum segmentation without requiring labeled data from target regions. We compile a million-scale satellite imagery dataset from 12 cities across four continents for source training. Using this dataset, the model employs a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to capture region-specific slum characteristics while learning universal features through a shared backbone. During adaptation, prediction consistency across experts filters out unreliable pseudo-labels, allowing the model to generalize effectively to previously unseen regions. GRAM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in low-resource settings such as African cities, offering a scalable and label-efficient solution for global slum mapping and data-driven urban planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The LLaVA architecture struggles with integrating visual features due to modality mismatch between text and vision. This paper addresses this by leveraging LLMs as both language models and vision encoders.

Method: Three key modifications: (1) learning separate QKV projections for vision modality, (2) enabling bidirectional attention on visual tokens, and (3) incorporating both global and local visual representations.

Result: LLaViT significantly outperforms baseline LLaVA on multiple benchmarks, even surpassing models with double its parameter count.

Conclusion: LLaViT establishes a more effective approach to vision-language modeling by enabling LLMs to function simultaneously as language models and vision encoders.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of the LLaVA architecture for vision-language tasks, its design inherently struggles to effectively integrate visual features due to the inherent mismatch between text and vision modalities. We tackle this issue from a novel perspective in which the LLM not only serves as a language model but also a powerful vision encoder. To this end, we present LLaViT - Large Language Models as extended Vision Transformers - which enables the LLM to simultaneously function as a vision encoder through three key modifications: (1) learning separate QKV projections for vision modality, (2) enabling bidirectional attention on visual tokens, and (3) incorporating both global and local visual representations. Through extensive controlled experiments on a wide range of LLMs, we demonstrate that LLaViT significantly outperforms the baseline LLaVA method on a multitude of benchmarks, even surpassing models with double its parameter count, establishing a more effective approach to vision-language modeling.

Motivation: Current pedestrian detection benchmarks have weaknesses in performance evaluation metrics that don't provide realistic assessment of DNN performance, especially for safety-critical automated driving systems.

Method: Proposes 8 different error categories for pedestrian detection and new metrics for performance comparison. Uses image segmentation to automatically distinguish error types and compares various backbones for a simplified version of APD.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CityPersons-reasonable dataset without extra training data using a simple architecture. Demonstrates more fine-grained and robust model comparison, especially for safety-critical performance.

Conclusion: The proposed error categories and metrics provide a more realistic and fine-grained evaluation framework for pedestrian detection, enabling better comparison of models for safety-critical automated driving applications.

Abstract: Reliable pedestrian detection represents a crucial step towards automated driving systems. However, the current performance benchmarks exhibit weaknesses. The currently applied metrics for various subsets of a validation dataset prohibit a realistic performance evaluation of a DNN for pedestrian detection. As image segmentation supplies fine-grained information about a street scene, it can serve as a starting point to automatically distinguish between different types of errors during the evaluation of a pedestrian detector. In this work, eight different error categories for pedestrian detection are proposed and new metrics are proposed for performance comparison along these error categories. We use the new metrics to compare various backbones for a simplified version of the APD, and show a more fine-grained and robust way to compare models with each other especially in terms of safety-critical performance. We achieve SOTA on CityPersons-reasonable (without extra training data) by using a rather simple architecture.

TL;DR: CLIP4VI-ReID: A novel CLIP-driven network for visible-infrared person re-identification that uses text semantics as a bridge to align visible and infrared modalities through three components: Text Semantic Generation, Infrared Feature Embedding, and High-level Semantic Alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the huge gap in physical characteristics between natural visible images and infrared images in VI-ReID tasks, enabling effective cross-modal alignment and shared representation learning.

Method: Three-stage approach: 1) TSG generates text semantics for visible images for preliminary visible-text alignment, 2) IFE rectifies infrared features using text semantics to inject ID-related information, 3) HSA refines high-level semantic alignment to ensure text contains only ID-related information.

Result: Extensive experiments show CLIP4VI-ReID achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on widely used VI-ReID datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively bridges the visible-infrared modality gap using text as an intermediate representation, achieving accurate cross-modal alignment and discriminative shared representations for VI-ReID.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel CLIP-driven modality-shared representation learning network named CLIP4VI-ReID for VI-ReID task, which consists of Text Semantic Generation (TSG), Infrared Feature Embedding (IFE), and High-level Semantic Alignment (HSA). Specifically, considering the huge gap in the physical characteristics between natural images and infrared images, the TSG is designed to generate text semantics only for visible images, thereby enabling preliminary visible-text modality alignment. Then, the IFE is proposed to rectify the feature embeddings of infrared images using the generated text semantics. This process injects id-related semantics into the shared image encoder, enhancing its adaptability to the infrared modality. Besides, with text serving as a bridge, it enables indirect visible-infrared modality alignment. Finally, the HSA is established to refine the high-level semantic alignment. This process ensures that the fine-tuned text semantics only contain id-related information, thereby achieving more accurate cross-modal alignment and enhancing the discriminability of the learned modal-shared representations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CLIP4VI-ReID achieves superior performance than other state-of-the-art methods on some widely used VI-ReID datasets.

Motivation: Existing methods fail to address inconsistent supervisory signals between near-field and far-field regions in 3D reconstruction, leading to inaccurate depth estimation in distant areas and structural degradation in close-range regions.

Method: Two core components: (1) Depth-of-field Supervision using scale-recovered monocular depth estimator and defocus convolution for physically accurate defocused images with depth-of-field loss; (2) Multi-View Consistency Supervision using LoFTR-based semi-dense feature matching and least squares optimization for cross-view geometric consistency.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges physical imaging principles with learning-based depth regularization, offering a scalable solution for complex depth stratification in urban environments.

Abstract: Three-dimensional reconstruction in scenes with extreme depth variations remains challenging due to inconsistent supervisory signals between near-field and far-field regions. Existing methods fail to simultaneously address inaccurate depth estimation in distant areas and structural degradation in close-range regions. This paper proposes a novel computational framework that integrates depth-of-field supervision and multi-view consistency supervision to advance 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our approach comprises two core components: (1) Depth-of-field Supervision employs a scale-recovered monocular depth estimator (e.g., Metric3D) to generate depth priors, leverages defocus convolution to synthesize physically accurate defocused images, and enforces geometric consistency through a novel depth-of-field loss, thereby enhancing depth fidelity in both far-field and near-field regions; (2) Multi-View Consistency Supervision employing LoFTR-based semi-dense feature matching to minimize cross-view geometric errors and enforce depth consistency via least squares optimization of reliable matched points. By unifying defocus physics with multi-view geometric constraints, our method achieves superior depth fidelity, demonstrating a 0.8 dB PSNR improvement over the state-of-the-art method on the Waymo Open Dataset. This framework bridges physical imaging principles and learning-based depth regularization, offering a scalable solution for complex depth stratification in urban environments.

TL;DR: DSANet is a novel weakly-supervised video anomaly detection method that disentangles abnormal and normal features through self-guided normality modeling and decoupled contrastive semantic alignment, achieving state-of-the-art performance on XD-Violence and UCF-Crime benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods tend to detect only the most salient anomalous segments while neglecting diverse normal patterns and suffer from category confusion due to similar appearances, leading to unsatisfactory fine-grained classification results.

Method: Proposes DSANet with two key components: 1) Self-guided normality modeling branch that reconstructs video features using learned normal prototypes to separate normal patterns from anomalies; 2) Decoupled contrastive semantic alignment that temporally decomposes videos into event-centric and background-centric components and applies visual-language contrastive learning.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on XD-Violence and UCF-Crime benchmarks demonstrate that DSANet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed disentangled semantic alignment approach effectively enhances the distinguishability between abnormal and normal patterns from both coarse-grained and fine-grained perspectives, achieving superior performance in weakly-supervised video anomaly detection.

Abstract: Recent advancements in weakly-supervised video anomaly detection have achieved remarkable performance by applying the multiple instance learning paradigm based on multimodal foundation models such as CLIP to highlight anomalous instances and classify categories. However, their objectives may tend to detect the most salient response segments, while neglecting to mine diverse normal patterns separated from anomalies, and are prone to category confusion due to similar appearance, leading to unsatisfactory fine-grained classification results. Therefore, we propose a novel Disentangled Semantic Alignment Network (DSANet) to explicitly separate abnormal and normal features from coarse-grained and fine-grained aspects, enhancing the distinguishability. Specifically, at the coarse-grained level, we introduce a self-guided normality modeling branch that reconstructs input video features under the guidance of learned normal prototypes, encouraging the model to exploit normality cues inherent in the video, thereby improving the temporal separation of normal patterns and anomalous events. At the fine-grained level, we present a decoupled contrastive semantic alignment mechanism, which first temporally decomposes each video into event-centric and background-centric components using frame-level anomaly scores and then applies visual-language contrastive learning to enhance class-discriminative representations. Comprehensive experiments on two standard benchmarks, namely XD-Violence and UCF-Crime, demonstrate that DSANet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based methods for SDG object detection overlook feature distribution structure and frequency-domain characteristics, limiting robustness to domain shifts.

Method: Integrates von Mises-Fisher distribution to model directional features for domain-invariant semantics, and Fourier transformation for amplitude/phase perturbation to simulate domain shifts.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on diverse weather-driving benchmark, demonstrating improved cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully enhances SDG object detection by combining structural feature modeling with frequency-domain augmentation while preserving CLIP's semantic alignment benefits.

Abstract: Single Domain Generalization (SDG) for object detection aims to train a model on a single source domain that can generalize effectively to unseen target domains. While recent methods like CLIP-based semantic augmentation have shown promise, they often overlook the underlying structure of feature distributions and frequency-domain characteristics that are critical for robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that enhances SDG object detection by integrating the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution and Fourier transformation into a CLIP-guided pipeline. Specifically, we model the directional features of object representations using vMF to better capture domain-invariant semantic structures in the embedding space. Additionally, we introduce a Fourier-based augmentation strategy that perturbs amplitude and phase components to simulate domain shifts in the frequency domain, further improving feature robustness. Our method not only preserves the semantic alignment benefits of CLIP but also enriches feature diversity and structural consistency across domains. Extensive experiments on the diverse weather-driving benchmark demonstrate that our approach outperforms the existing state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: AI-based dermatology adoption remains limited by biased datasets, variable image quality, and limited validation. We introduce DermAI, a lightweight, smartphone-based application that enables real-time capture, annotation, and classification of skin lesions during routine consultations. Unlike prior dermoscopy-focused tools, DermAI performs on-device quality checks, and local model adaptation. The DermAI clinical dataset, encompasses a wide range of skin tones, ethinicity and source devices. In preliminary experiments, models trained on public datasets failed to generalize to our samples, while fine-tuning with local data improved performance. These results highlight the importance of standardized, diverse data collection aligned with healthcare needs and oriented to machine learning development.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SHRUG-FM is a reliability-aware prediction framework that combines OOD detection in input/embedding spaces and predictive uncertainty to improve geospatial foundation model reliability in underrepresented environments, particularly for burn scar segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geospatial foundation models often fail in underrepresented environments during pretraining, creating reliability gaps in real-world climate-sensitive applications.

Method: Integrates three signals: OOD detection in input space, OOD detection in embedding space, and task-specific predictive uncertainty for reliability assessment.

Result: OOD scores correlate with lower performance in specific environmental conditions, uncertainty flags help discard poor predictions, and failures concentrate in underrepresented geographies like low-elevation zones and large river areas.

Conclusion: SHRUG-FM provides a pathway toward safer, more interpretable deployment of geospatial foundation models, bridging the gap between benchmark performance and real-world reliability.

Abstract: Geospatial foundation models for Earth observation often fail to perform reliably in environments underrepresented during pretraining. We introduce SHRUG-FM, a framework for reliability-aware prediction that integrates three complementary signals: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in the input space, OOD detection in the embedding space and task-specific predictive uncertainty. Applied to burn scar segmentation, SHRUG-FM shows that OOD scores correlate with lower performance in specific environmental conditions, while uncertainty-based flags help discard many poorly performing predictions. Linking these flags to land cover attributes from HydroATLAS shows that failures are not random but concentrated in certain geographies, such as low-elevation zones and large river areas, likely due to underrepresentation in pretraining data. SHRUG-FM provides a pathway toward safer and more interpretable deployment of GFMs in climate-sensitive applications, helping bridge the gap between benchmark performance and real-world reliability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSGNav is a zero-shot navigation system using Multi-modal 3D Scene Graphs (M3DSG) that preserves visual cues through image-based relational edges, addressing limitations of text-only scene graphs and solving the last-mile problem in navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot navigation methods using explicit 3D scene graphs compress visual observations into text-only relations, leading to high construction cost, irreversible loss of visual evidence, and constrained vocabularies.

Method: Introduces M3DSG with image-based relational edges instead of text, and MSGNav system with Key Subgraph Selection, Adaptive Vocabulary Update, Closed-Loop Reasoning modules, plus Visibility-based Viewpoint Decision for last-mile problem.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on GOAT-Bench and HM3D-OVON datasets, demonstrating superior zero-shot navigation capabilities.

Conclusion: MSGNav effectively addresses limitations of existing zero-shot methods by preserving visual evidence and explicitly solving the last-mile problem, enabling robust open-vocabulary navigation with low training overhead.

Abstract: Embodied navigation is a fundamental capability for robotic agents operating. Real-world deployment requires open vocabulary generalization and low training overhead, motivating zero-shot methods rather than task-specific RL training. However, existing zero-shot methods that build explicit 3D scene graphs often compress rich visual observations into text-only relations, leading to high construction cost, irreversible loss of visual evidence, and constrained vocabularies. To address these limitations, we introduce the Multi-modal 3D Scene Graph (M3DSG), which preserves visual cues by replacing textual relational edges with dynamically assigned images. Built on M3DSG, we propose MSGNav, a zero-shot navigation system that includes a Key Subgraph Selection module for efficient reasoning, an Adaptive Vocabulary Update module for open vocabulary support, and a Closed-Loop Reasoning module for accurate exploration reasoning. Additionally, we further identify the last-mile problem in zero-shot navigation - determining the feasible target location with a suitable final viewpoint, and propose a Visibility-based Viewpoint Decision module to explicitly resolve it. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that MSGNav achieves state-of-the-art performance on GOAT-Bench and HM3D-OVON datasets. The open-source code will be publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Current AI privacy defenses like Anti-DreamBooth are vulnerable to simple image purification attacks, offering false security against facial identity leakage in personalized generation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address critical limitations in existing privacy defenses for personalized AI applications, particularly their vulnerability to purification attacks and perceptible artifacts.

Method: Proposed AntiDB_Purify evaluation framework to systematically test existing defenses under realistic purification threats including traditional image filters and adversarial purification methods.

Result: All current defense methods fail to maintain protective effectiveness under purification threats, with adversarial perturbations being both perceptible and easily removable.

Conclusion: Current defenses provide only a false sense of security, highlighting the urgent need for more imperceptible and robust protection methods to safeguard user identity in personalized generation systems.

Abstract: Personalized AI applications such as DreamBooth enable the generation of customized content from user images, but also raise significant privacy concerns, particularly the risk of facial identity leakage. Recent defense mechanisms like Anti-DreamBooth attempt to mitigate this risk by injecting adversarial perturbations into user photos to prevent successful personalization. However, we identify two critical yet overlooked limitations of these methods. First, the adversarial examples often exhibit perceptible artifacts such as conspicuous patterns or stripes, making them easily detectable as manipulated content. Second, the perturbations are highly fragile, as even a simple, non-learned filter can effectively remove them, thereby restoring the model's ability to memorize and reproduce user identity. To investigate this vulnerability, we propose a novel evaluation framework, AntiDB_Purify, to systematically evaluate existing defenses under realistic purification threats, including both traditional image filters and adversarial purification. Results reveal that none of the current methods maintains their protective effectiveness under such threats. These findings highlight that current defenses offer a false sense of security and underscore the urgent need for more imperceptible and robust protections to safeguard user identity in personalized generation.

Conclusion: SAMIRO effectively enhances lane detection performance by leveraging knowledge transfer from pretrained models while maintaining spatial information, providing a versatile solution that can be integrated into various existing lane detection methods.

Abstract: Lane detection is an important topic in the future mobility solutions. Real-world environmental challenges such as background clutter, varying illumination, and occlusions pose significant obstacles to effective lane detection, particularly when relying on data-driven approaches that require substantial effort and cost for data collection and annotation. To address these issues, lane detection methods must leverage contextual and global information from surrounding lanes and objects. In this paper, we propose a Spatial Attention Mutual Information Regularization with a pre-trained model as an Oracle, called SAMIRO. SAMIRO enhances lane detection performance by transferring knowledge from a pretrained model while preserving domain-agnostic spatial information. Leveraging SAMIRO's plug-and-play characteristic, we integrate it into various state-of-the-art lane detection approaches and conduct extensive experiments on major benchmarks such as CULane, Tusimple, and LLAMAS. The results demonstrate that SAMIRO consistently improves performance across different models and datasets. The code will be made available upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate retrieval of vegetation biophysical variables is crucial for ecosystem monitoring and agricultural management, but existing methods require real satellite images for training.

Method: Transformer-VAE architecture incorporating PROSAIL radiative transfer model as differentiable physical decoder, trained exclusively on simulated data without real imagery or in-situ labels.

Result: Achieves LAI and CCC retrieval accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods using real Sentinel-2 data, validated on FRM4Veg and BelSAR field datasets.

Conclusion: Demonstrates cost-effective, self-supervised solution for global vegetation monitoring by integrating physical models with deep networks, enabling large-scale physically-constrained remote sensing.

Abstract: Accurate retrieval of vegetation biophysical variables from satellite imagery is crucial for ecosystem monitoring and agricultural management. In this work, we propose a physics-informed Transformer-VAE architecture to invert the PROSAIL radiative transfer model for simultaneous estimation of key canopy parameters from Sentinel-2 data. Unlike previous hybrid approaches that require real satellite images for self-supevised training. Our model is trained exclusively on simulated data, yet achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art methods that utilize real imagery. The Transformer-VAE incorporates the PROSAIL model as a differentiable physical decoder, ensuring that inferred latent variables correspond to physically plausible leaf and canopy properties. We demonstrate retrieval of leaf area index (LAI) and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) on real-world field datasets (FRM4Veg and BelSAR) with accuracy comparable to models trained with real Sentinel-2 data. Our method requires no in-situ labels or calibration on real images, offering a cost-effective and self-supervised solution for global vegetation monitoring. The proposed approach illustrates how integrating physical models with advanced deep networks can improve the inversion of RTMs, opening new prospects for large-scale, physically-constrained remote sensing of vegetation traits.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world documents often feature complex layouts that challenge existing OCR systems, including multi-level tables, embedded images/formulas, and cross-page structures that require improved layout understanding and content recognition.

Method: Two-stage parsing pipeline: first stage uses large multimodal model for joint layout and reading order prediction; second stage performs localized recognition of text, formulas, and tables. Includes visual consistency-based reinforcement learning for table structures, Image-Decoupled Table Parsing, and Type-Guided Table Merging modules.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on OmniDocBench v1.5, outperforming PPOCR-VL and MinerU 2.5 with exceptional robustness in visually complex document scenarios.

Conclusion: MonkeyOCR v1.5 provides an effective unified framework for complex document parsing, demonstrating superior performance and robustness through its two-stage approach and specialized modules for handling embedded content and cross-page structures.

Abstract: Document parsing is a core task in document intelligence, supporting applications such as information extraction, retrieval-augmented generation, and automated document analysis. However, real-world documents often feature complex layouts with multi-level tables, embedded images or formulas, and cross-page structures, which remain challenging for existing OCR systems. We introduce MonkeyOCR v1.5, a unified vision-language framework that enhances both layout understanding and content recognition through a two-stage parsing pipeline. The first stage employs a large multimodal model to jointly predict document layout and reading order, leveraging visual information to ensure structural and sequential consistency. The second stage performs localized recognition of text, formulas, and tables within detected regions, maintaining high visual fidelity while reducing error propagation. To address complex table structures, we propose a visual consistency-based reinforcement learning scheme that evaluates recognition quality via render-and-compare alignment, improving structural accuracy without manual annotations. Additionally, two specialized modules, Image-Decoupled Table Parsing and Type-Guided Table Merging, are introduced to enable reliable parsing of tables containing embedded images and reconstruction of tables crossing pages or columns. Comprehensive experiments on OmniDocBench v1.5 demonstrate that MonkeyOCR v1.5 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming PPOCR-VL and MinerU 2.5 while showing exceptional robustness in visually complex document scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GrounDiff is a diffusion-based framework that converts Digital Surface Models (DSMs) to Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) by iteratively removing non-ground structures as a denoising task, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional DTM generation methods require manual parameter tuning, while learning-based approaches need complex architectures and post-processing. There's a need for more effective and scalable solutions for bare-earth elevation modeling.

Method: Proposes Ground Diffusion (GrounDiff) using diffusion models for iterative denoising, with gated design and confidence-guided generation. Also introduces Prior-Guided Stitching (PrioStitch) for scalability using downsampled global priors to guide local predictions.

Result: Significantly outperforms deep learning SOTA methods: reduces RMSE by up to 93% on ALS2DTM and 47% on USGS benchmarks. For road reconstruction, achieves up to 81% lower distance error on GeRoD benchmark while maintaining competitive smoothness.

Conclusion: GrounDiff provides an effective diffusion-based solution for DSM-to-DTM conversion, demonstrating superior performance across diverse datasets and applications including road reconstruction, without requiring task-specific optimization.

Abstract: Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) represent the bare-earth elevation and are important in numerous geospatial applications. Such data models cannot be directly measured by sensors and are typically generated from Digital Surface Models (DSMs) derived from LiDAR or photogrammetry. Traditional filtering approaches rely on manually tuned parameters, while learning-based methods require well-designed architectures, often combined with post-processing. To address these challenges, we introduce Ground Diffusion (GrounDiff), the first diffusion-based framework that iteratively removes non-ground structures by formulating the problem as a denoising task. We incorporate a gated design with confidence-guided generation that enables selective filtering. To increase scalability, we further propose Prior-Guided Stitching (PrioStitch), which employs a downsampled global prior automatically generated using GrounDiff to guide local high-resolution predictions. We evaluate our method on the DSM-to-DTM translation task across diverse datasets, showing that GrounDiff consistently outperforms deep learning-based state-of-the-art methods, reducing RMSE by up to 93% on ALS2DTM and up to 47% on USGS benchmarks. In the task of road reconstruction, which requires both high precision and smoothness, our method achieves up to 81% lower distance error compared to specialized techniques on the GeRoD benchmark, while maintaining competitive surface smoothness using only DSM inputs, without task-specific optimization. Our variant for road reconstruction, GrounDiff+, is specifically designed to produce even smoother surfaces, further surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes YOLOMS+LLM framework for wind turbine fault detection, combining visual detection with semantic reasoning to generate interpretable maintenance recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fault detection methods lack semantic interpretability and fail to support maintenance decision-making, limiting their practical utility.

Method: YOLOMS with multi-scale detection and sliding-window cropping for feature extraction, plus KV mapping module to convert visual outputs to structured text, followed by domain-tuned LLM for semantic reasoning.

Result: Achieves 90.6% fault detection accuracy and generates maintenance reports with 89% average accuracy on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The framework improves diagnostic interpretability and provides practical decision support for wind turbine operation and maintenance.

Abstract: The health condition of wind turbine (WT) components is crucial for ensuring stable and reliable operation. However, existing fault detection methods are largely limited to visual recognition, producing structured outputs that lack semantic interpretability and fail to support maintenance decision-making. To address these limitations, this study proposes an integrated framework that combines YOLOMS with a large language model (LLM) for intelligent fault analysis and diagnosis. Specifically, YOLOMS employs multi-scale detection and sliding-window cropping to enhance fault feature extraction, while a lightweight key-value (KV) mapping module bridges the gap between visual outputs and textual inputs. This module converts YOLOMS detection results into structured textual representations enriched with both qualitative and quantitative attributes. A domain-tuned LLM then performs semantic reasoning to generate interpretable fault analyses and maintenance recommendations. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a fault detection accuracy of 90.6\% and generates maintenance reports with an average accuracy of 89\%, thereby improving the interpretability of diagnostic results and providing practical decision support for the operation and maintenance of wind turbines.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively automates and standardizes facial plane localization in 3D fetal ultrasound, addressing key challenges in fetal facial assessment.

Abstract: Acquiring standard facial planes during routine fetal ultrasound (US) examinations is often challenging due to fetal movement, variability in orientation, and operator-dependent expertise. These factors contribute to inconsistencies, increased examination time, and potential diagnostic bias.
  To address these challenges in the context of facial assessment, we present: 1) GT++, a robust algorithm that estimates standard facial planes from 3D US volumes using annotated anatomical landmarks; and 2) 3DFETUS, a deep learning model that automates and standardizes their localization in 3D fetal US volumes.
  We evaluated our methods both qualitatively, through expert clinical review, and quantitatively. The proposed approach achieved a mean translation error of 4.13 mm and a mean rotation error of 7.93 degrees per plane, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods on 3D US volumes. Clinical assessments further confirmed the effectiveness of both GT++ and 3DFETUS, demonstrating statistically significant improvements in plane estimation accuracy.

Motivation: Current digital pathology pipelines use grid-based tiling that ignores tissue architecture, introducing irrelevant information and limiting interpretability of cancer grading.

Method: Semantic segmentation to extract glands from whole slide images as input patches for multiple-instance learning, trained on 137 samples from ProMPT cohort.

Result: Achieved gland-level Dice score of 0.83 +/- 0.17, improved MIL models AUCs by 10% for detecting CNVs in EMT and MYC genes, and revealed 15 gland clusters associated with cancer relapse, mutations, and high Gleason scores.

Conclusion: HIT improves accuracy and interpretability of MIL predictions while streamlining computations by focusing on biologically meaningful structures during feature extraction.

Abstract: Histopathologists establish cancer grade by assessing histological structures, such as glands in prostate cancer. Yet, digital pathology pipelines often rely on grid-based tiling that ignores tissue architecture. This introduces irrelevant information and limits interpretability. We introduce histology-informed tiling (HIT), which uses semantic segmentation to extract glands from whole slide images (WSIs) as biologically meaningful input patches for multiple-instance learning (MIL) and phenotyping. Trained on 137 samples from the ProMPT cohort, HIT achieved a gland-level Dice score of 0.83 +/- 0.17. By extracting 380,000 glands from 760 WSIs across ICGC-C and TCGA-PRAD cohorts, HIT improved MIL models AUCs by 10% for detecting copy number variation (CNVs) in genes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) and MYC, and revealed 15 gland clusters, several of which were associated with cancer relapse, oncogenic mutations, and high Gleason. Therefore, HIT improved the accuracy and interpretability of MIL predictions, while streamlining computations by focussing on biologically meaningful structures during feature extraction.

Conclusion: OpenSR-SRGAN serves as a practical tool and benchmark implementation that makes GAN-based super-resolution accessible for diverse Earth-observation datasets through configuration-driven workflows.

Abstract: We present OpenSR-SRGAN, an open and modular framework for single-image super-resolution in Earth Observation. The software provides a unified implementation of SRGAN-style models that is easy to configure, extend, and apply to multispectral satellite data such as Sentinel-2. Instead of requiring users to modify model code, OpenSR-SRGAN exposes generators, discriminators, loss functions, and training schedules through concise configuration files, making it straightforward to switch between architectures, scale factors, and band setups. The framework is designed as a practical tool and benchmark implementation rather than a state-of-the-art model. It ships with ready-to-use configurations for common remote sensing scenarios, sensible default settings for adversarial training, and built-in hooks for logging, validation, and large-scene inference. By turning GAN-based super-resolution into a configuration-driven workflow, OpenSR-SRGAN lowers the entry barrier for researchers and practitioners who wish to experiment with SRGANs, compare models in a reproducible way, and deploy super-resolution pipelines across diverse Earth-observation datasets.

TL;DR: Automated CT imaging analysis shows pancreatic surface lobularity is higher in diabetic patients and can help screen for Type 2 Diabetes with 90% AUC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of Type 2 Diabetes is crucial as it can cause pancreatic damage, but the role of pancreatic surface lobularity in T2DM hasn't been fully investigated.

Method: Used four deep learning models to segment pancreas in 584 patients, automatically detected pancreatic surface lobularity, and developed multivariate model with CT biomarkers for T2DM prediction.

Result: PSL was significantly higher in diabetic patients (4.26±8.32 vs 3.19±3.62, p=0.01). PancAP model achieved best segmentation (Dice: 0.79±0.17). T2DM prediction model attained 0.90 AUC, 66.7% sensitivity, 91.9% specificity.

Conclusion: Pancreatic surface lobularity is useful for T2DM screening and could potentially help predict early onset of Type 2 Diabetes.

Abstract: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection is crucial as it can alter pancreas function through morphological changes and increased deposition of ectopic fat, eventually leading to organ damage. While studies have shown an association between T2DM and pancreas volume and fat content, the role of increased pancreatic surface lobularity (PSL) in patients with T2DM has not been fully investigated. In this pilot work, we propose a fully automated approach to delineate the pancreas and other abdominal structures, derive CT imaging biomarkers, and opportunistically screen for T2DM. Four deep learning-based models were used to segment the pancreas in an internal dataset of 584 patients (297 males, 437 non-diabetic, age: 45$\pm$15 years). PSL was automatically detected and it was higher for diabetic patients (p=0.01) at 4.26 $\pm$ 8.32 compared to 3.19 $\pm$ 3.62 for non-diabetic patients. The PancAP model achieved the highest Dice score of 0.79 $\pm$ 0.17 and lowest ASSD error of 1.94 $\pm$ 2.63 mm (p$<$0.05). For predicting T2DM, a multivariate model trained with CT biomarkers attained 0.90 AUC, 66.7\% sensitivity, and 91.9\% specificity. Our results suggest that PSL is useful for T2DM screening and could potentially help predict the early onset of T2DM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical Total Variation's dependence on fixed lambda parameter limits efficiency and effectiveness in image reconstruction.

Method: Couples unrolled TV solver with data-driven Lambda Mapping Network (LambdaNet) that predicts per-pixel regularization map, trained end-to-end for joint optimization.

Result: +2.9 dB PSNR and +6% SSIM improvement over classical TV and FBP+U-Net on DeepLesion dataset with realistic CT noise model.

Conclusion: LTV provides interpretable alternative to black-box CNNs and serves as basis for 3D and data-consistency-driven reconstruction.

Abstract: Although Total Variation (TV) performs well in noise reduction and edge preservation on images, its dependence on the lambda parameter limits its efficiency and makes it difficult to use effectively. In this study, we present a Learnable Total Variation (LTV) framework that couples an unrolled TV solver with a data-driven Lambda Mapping Network (LambdaNet) predicting a per-pixel regularization map. The pipeline is trained end-to-end so that reconstruction and regularization are optimized jointly, yielding spatially adaptive smoothing: strong in homogeneous regions, relaxed near anatomical boundaries. Experiments on the DeepLesion dataset, using a realistic noise model adapted from the LoDoPaB-CT methodology, show consistent gains over classical TV and FBP+U-Net: +2.9 dB PSNR and +6% SSIM on average. LTV provides an interpretable alternative to black-box CNNs and a basis for 3D and data-consistency-driven reconstruction. Our codes are available at: https://github.com/itu-biai/deep_tv_for_ldct

TL;DR: SemanticVLA is a Vision-Language-Action framework that addresses perceptual redundancy and instruction-vision misalignment in robotic manipulation through semantic-aligned sparsification and enhancement, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significant efficiency improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models suffer from perceptual redundancy (processing irrelevant visual inputs inefficiently) and superficial instruction-vision alignment, which hampers semantic grounding of actions in robotic manipulation tasks.

Method: 1) Semantic-guided Dual Visual Pruner (SD-Pruner) with Instruction-driven Pruner and Spatial-aggregation Pruner for sparsifying redundant perception while preserving semantic alignment; 2) Semantic-complementary Hierarchical Fuser (SH-Fuser) for integrating semantics with spatial geometry; 3) Semantic-conditioned Action Coupler (SA-Coupler) for enhanced perception-to-action transformation.

Result: SemanticVLA surpasses OpenVLA on LIBERO benchmark by 21.1% in success rate, while reducing training cost and inference latency by 3.0-fold and 2.7-fold. Sets new SOTA in both performance and efficiency across simulation and real-world tasks.

Conclusion: SemanticVLA effectively addresses key limitations in VLA models through semantic-aligned sparsification and enhancement, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency for robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced in robotic manipulation, yet practical deployment remains hindered by two key limitations: 1) perceptual redundancy, where irrelevant visual inputs are processed inefficiently, and 2) superficial instruction-vision alignment, which hampers semantic grounding of actions. In this paper, we propose SemanticVLA, a novel VLA framework that performs Semantic-Aligned Sparsification and Enhancement for Efficient Robotic Manipulation. Specifically: 1) To sparsify redundant perception while preserving semantic alignment, Semantic-guided Dual Visual Pruner (SD-Pruner) performs: Instruction-driven Pruner (ID-Pruner) extracts global action cues and local semantic anchors in SigLIP; Spatial-aggregation Pruner (SA-Pruner) compacts geometry-rich features into task-adaptive tokens in DINOv2. 2) To exploit sparsified features and integrate semantics with spatial geometry, Semantic-complementary Hierarchical Fuser (SH-Fuser) fuses dense patches and sparse tokens across SigLIP and DINOv2 for coherent representation. 3) To enhance the transformation from perception to action, Semantic-conditioned Action Coupler (SA-Coupler) replaces the conventional observation-to-DoF approach, yielding more efficient and interpretable behavior modeling for manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on simulation and real-world tasks show that SemanticVLA sets a new SOTA in both performance and efficiency. SemanticVLA surpasses OpenVLA on LIBERO benchmark by 21.1% in success rate, while reducing training cost and inference latency by 3.0-fold and 2.7-fold.SemanticVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/SemanticVLA

*Wenqing Wang,Haosen Yang,Josef Kittler,Xiatian Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Separate-then-Map (StM) strategy for reconstructing dynamic humans interacting with environments from monocular videos, using a shared transformation function to unify separately modeled components while maintaining spatial and visual coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches either model dynamic scenes holistically (neglecting distinct motion characteristics) or model scenes and backgrounds separately (causing spatial inconsistencies and artifacts at human-scene boundaries).

Method: StM strategy with dedicated information mapping mechanism using shared transformation functions for Gaussian attributes to unify separately modeled components, avoiding exhaustive pairwise interactions.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and rendering accuracy, especially at human-scene interaction boundaries, as demonstrated on monocular video datasets.

Conclusion: The Separate-then-Map approach effectively bridges separately defined models while maintaining computational efficiency and spatial coherence, providing superior reconstruction of dynamic human-scene interactions.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic humans interacting with real-world environments from monocular videos is an important and challenging task. Despite considerable progress in 4D neural rendering, existing approaches either model dynamic scenes holistically or model scenes and backgrounds separately aim to introduce parametric human priors. However, these approaches either neglect distinct motion characteristics of various components in scene especially human, leading to incomplete reconstructions, or ignore the information exchange between the separately modeled components, resulting in spatial inconsistencies and visual artifacts at human-scene boundaries. To address this, we propose {\bf Separate-then-Map} (StM) strategy that introduces a dedicated information mapping mechanism to bridge separately defined and optimized models. Our method employs a shared transformation function for each Gaussian attribute to unify separately modeled components, enhancing computational efficiency by avoiding exhaustive pairwise interactions while ensuring spatial and visual coherence between humans and their surroundings. Extensive experiments on monocular video datasets demonstrate that StM significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual quality and rendering accuracy, particularly at challenging human-scene interaction boundaries.

TL;DR: A framework for evaluating diversity in text-to-image models through systematic assessment of concepts and their variation factors, including human evaluation templates, curated prompts, and statistical comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models often generate homogeneous outputs despite quality improvements, highlighting the need for robust diversity evaluation methods.

Method: Systematic diversity assessment framework with human evaluation templates, curated prompt sets with identified variation factors, binomial test comparisons, and rigorous comparison of image embeddings.

Result: Enables principled ranking of T2I models by diversity and identifies specific categories where models struggle with diversity.

Conclusion: Provides a robust methodology for diversity evaluation that can drive improvements in T2I model diversity and metric development.

Abstract: Despite advances in generation quality, current text-to-image (T2I) models often lack diversity, generating homogeneous outputs. This work introduces a framework to address the need for robust diversity evaluation in T2I models. Our framework systematically assesses diversity by evaluating individual concepts and their relevant factors of variation. Key contributions include: (1) a novel human evaluation template for nuanced diversity assessment; (2) a curated prompt set covering diverse concepts with their identified factors of variation (e.g. prompt: An image of an apple, factor of variation: color); and (3) a methodology for comparing models in terms of human annotations via binomial tests.
  Furthermore, we rigorously compare various image embeddings for diversity measurement. Notably, our principled approach enables ranking of T2I models by diversity, identifying categories where they particularly struggle. This research offers a robust methodology and insights, paving the way for improvements in T2I model diversity and metric development.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoTyle enables generating novel, consistent visual styles from numerical codes by training a style codebook and autoregressive style generator, then using these embeddings to guide text-to-image diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing style generation methods rely on lengthy prompts, reference images, or fine-tuning, struggling with consistency and creativity. The paper aims to simplify style generation by proving that a single numerical code can represent a complete visual style.

Method: Train a discrete style codebook from image collections to extract style embeddings, use these as conditions for text-to-image diffusion models, then train an autoregressive style generator to model style embedding distribution and synthesize novel styles from numerical codes.

Result: CoTyle successfully generates diverse and consistent visual styles from minimal numerical input, validating that a style can be effectively represented by a single code while maintaining reproducibility across generations.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that visual styles can be effectively represented and controlled by numerical codes, introducing the first open-source method for code-to-style generation that offers simplicity, diversity, and reproducibility compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Innovative visual stylization is a cornerstone of artistic creation, yet generating novel and consistent visual styles remains a significant challenge. Existing generative approaches typically rely on lengthy textual prompts, reference images, or parameter-efficient fine-tuning to guide style-aware image generation, but often struggle with style consistency, limited creativity, and complex style representations. In this paper, we affirm that a style is worth one numerical code by introducing the novel task, code-to-style image generation, which produces images with novel, consistent visual styles conditioned solely on a numerical style code. To date, this field has only been primarily explored by the industry (e.g., Midjourney), with no open-source research from the academic community. To fill this gap, we propose CoTyle, the first open-source method for this task. Specifically, we first train a discrete style codebook from a collection of images to extract style embeddings. These embeddings serve as conditions for a text-to-image diffusion model (T2I-DM) to generate stylistic images. Subsequently, we train an autoregressive style generator on the discrete style embeddings to model their distribution, allowing the synthesis of novel style embeddings. During inference, a numerical style code is mapped to a unique style embedding by the style generator, and this embedding guides the T2I-DM to generate images in the corresponding style. Unlike existing methods, our method offers unparalleled simplicity and diversity, unlocking a vast space of reproducible styles from minimal input. Extensive experiments validate that CoTyle effectively turns a numerical code into a style controller, demonstrating a style is worth one code.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniVGGT is a framework that integrates geometric modalities (depth, camera intrinsics/extrinsics) into 3D foundation models using a GeoAdapter with zero-initialized convolutions and stochastic multimodal fusion, achieving SOTA results on various vision tasks and enhancing robotic VLA models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most 3D foundation models only use RGB inputs and ignore readily available geometric cues like camera intrinsics, poses, and depth maps, limiting their performance and practical utility.

Method: Proposes GeoAdapter with zero-initialized convolutions to inject geometric information without disrupting foundation model representations, and stochastic multimodal fusion that randomly samples modality subsets during training for robust learning.

Result: Outperforms prior methods with auxiliary inputs and achieves state-of-the-art results even with RGB-only input on monocular/multi-view depth estimation, multi-view stereo, and camera pose estimation. Enhanced VLA models show consistent gains on robotic tasks.

Conclusion: OmniVGGT effectively leverages geometric modalities with minimal overhead, demonstrating superior performance across diverse vision tasks and practical robotic applications while maintaining inference efficiency comparable to baseline models.

Abstract: General 3D foundation models have started to lead the trend of unifying diverse vision tasks, yet most assume RGB-only inputs and ignore readily available geometric cues (e.g., camera intrinsics, poses, and depth maps). To address this issue, we introduce OmniVGGT, a novel framework that can effectively benefit from an arbitrary number of auxiliary geometric modalities during both training and inference. In our framework, a GeoAdapter is proposed to encode depth and camera intrinsics/extrinsics into a spatial foundation model. It employs zero-initialized convolutions to progressively inject geometric information without disrupting the foundation model's representation space. This design ensures stable optimization with negligible overhead, maintaining inference speed comparable to VGGT even with multiple additional inputs. Additionally, a stochastic multimodal fusion regimen is proposed, which randomly samples modality subsets per instance during training. This enables an arbitrary number of modality inputs during testing and promotes learning robust spatial representations instead of overfitting to auxiliary cues. Comprehensive experiments on monocular/multi-view depth estimation, multi-view stereo, and camera pose estimation demonstrate that OmniVGGT outperforms prior methods with auxiliary inputs and achieves state-of-the-art results even with RGB-only input. To further highlight its practical utility, we integrated OmniVGGT into vision-language-action (VLA) models. The enhanced VLA model by OmniVGGT not only outperforms the vanilla point-cloud-based baseline on mainstream benchmarks, but also effectively leverages accessible auxiliary inputs to achieve consistent gains on robotic tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M&M-3D enables parameter-free 3D reasoning for Digital Breast Tomosynthesis by transferring weights from 2D mammography models, achieving superior performance in breast cancer detection with limited annotated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data scarcity in DBT by enabling 3D reasoning without requiring additional parameters or extensive training data, overcoming limitations of existing 2D flattening approaches and complex 3D architectures.

Method: Constructs malignancy-guided 3D features and learns 3D reasoning through repeated mixing of 3D features with slice-level information, modifying operations in existing M&M architecture without adding parameters to enable direct weight transfer from FFDM models.

Result: Outperforms 2D projection and 3D slice-based methods by 11-54% for localization and 3-10% for classification; beats complex 3D variants by 20-47% for localization and 2-10% for classification in low-data regime; achieves 4% improvement for classification and 10% for localization on BCS-DBT benchmark.

Conclusion: M&M-3D provides an effective solution for 3D reasoning in DBT with limited data by leveraging pre-trained 2D models, achieving state-of-the-art performance while maintaining parameter efficiency.

Abstract: Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) enhances finding visibility for breast cancer detection by providing volumetric information that reduces the impact of overlapping tissues; however, limited annotated data has constrained the development of deep learning models for DBT. To address data scarcity, existing methods attempt to reuse 2D full-field digital mammography (FFDM) models by either flattening DBT volumes or processing slices individually, thus discarding volumetric information. Alternatively, 3D reasoning approaches introduce complex architectures that require more DBT training data. Tackling these drawbacks, we propose M&M-3D, an architecture that enables learnable 3D reasoning while remaining parameter-free relative to its FFDM counterpart, M&M. M&M-3D constructs malignancy-guided 3D features, and 3D reasoning is learned through repeatedly mixing these 3D features with slice-level information. This is achieved by modifying operations in M&M without adding parameters, thus enabling direct weight transfer from FFDM. Extensive experiments show that M&M-3D surpasses 2D projection and 3D slice-based methods by 11-54% for localization and 3-10% for classification. Additionally, M&M-3D outperforms complex 3D reasoning variants by 20-47% for localization and 2-10% for classification in the low-data regime, while matching their performance in high-data regime. On the popular BCS-DBT benchmark, M&M-3D outperforms previous top baseline by 4% for classification and 10% for localization.

Conclusion: The MSOM framework successfully addresses key challenges in Sentinel-2 classification by integrating object-based analysis with Mamba architecture and multitask optimization, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Although Sentinel-2 based land use and land cover (LULC) classification is critical for various environmental monitoring applications, it is a very difficult task due to some key data challenges (e.g., spatial heterogeneity, context information, signature ambiguity). This paper presents a novel Multitask Glocal OBIA-Mamba (MSOM) for enhanced Sentinel-2 classification with the following contributions. First, an object-based image analysis (OBIA) Mamba model (OBIA-Mamba) is designed to reduce redundant computation without compromising fine-grained details by using superpixels as Mamba tokens. Second, a global-local (GLocal) dual-branch convolutional neural network (CNN)-mamba architecture is designed to jointly model local spatial detail and global contextual information. Third, a multitask optimization framework is designed to employ dual loss functions to balance local precision with global consistency. The proposed approach is tested on Sentinel-2 imagery in Alberta, Canada, in comparison with several advanced classification approaches, and the results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves higher classification accuracy and finer details that the other state-of-the-art methods.

*Qilong Yuan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel Partial Path Reconstruction (PPR) solver for the Joint Routing-Assignment problem achieves near-optimal solutions with 0.00% average deviation from ground truth, significantly improving computational efficiency over exact methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exact MIP solvers for JRA problems become computationally inefficient for large-scale instances, while existing heuristic methods achieve only ~1% deviation from optimum.

Method: Proposes PPR solver that identifies key item-placeholder pairs to form reduced subproblems, uses PJAR framework to iteratively polish solutions, and incorporates global Large-α constraint to enhance optimality.

Result: Achieves average deviation of 0.00% from ground truth on benchmark datasets (n=300,500,1000) while maintaining high computational efficiency, reducing deviation by half compared to previous heuristics.

Conclusion: The proposed framework delivers almost optimal solutions efficiently and shows strong potential for broader applications in TSP and related optimization problems.

Abstract: The Joint Routing-Assignment (JRA) optimization problem simultaneously determines the assignment of items to placeholders and a Hamiltonian cycle that visits each node pair exactly once, with the objective of minimizing total travel cost. Previous studies introduced an exact mixed-integer programming (MIP) solver, along with datasets and a Gurobi implementation, showing that while the exact approach guarantees optimality, it becomes computationally inefficient for large-scale instances. To overcome this limitation, heuristic methods based on merging algorithms and shaking procedures were proposed, achieving solutions within approximately 1% deviation from the optimum. This work presents a novel and more efficient approach that attains high-accuracy, near-optimal solutions for large-scale JRA problems. The proposed method introduces a Partial Path Reconstructon (PPR) solver that first identifies key item-placeholder pairs to form a reduced subproblem, which is solved efficiently to refine the global solution. Using this PJAR framework, the initial heuristic merging solutions can be further improved, reducing the deviation by half. Moreover, the solution can be iteratively polished with PPR based solver along the optimization path to yield highly accurate tours. Additionally, a global Large-α constraint is incorporated into the JRA model to further enhance solution optimality. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets with n = 300, 500, and 1000 demonstrate that the proposed method consistently delivers almost optimal solutions, achieving an average deviation of 0.00% from the ground truth while maintaining high computational efficiency. Beyond the JRA problem, the proposed framework and methodologies exhibit strong potential for broader applications. The Framework can be applied to TSP and related optimization problems.

Abstract: The Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (EVRP) extends the classical Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) to reflect the growing use of electric and hybrid vehicles in logistics. Due to the variety of constraints considered in the literature, comparing approaches across different problem variants remains challenging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world APIs are limited in availability, domain coverage, and stability, making them impractical for stable evaluation or scalable training of tool-use AI agents.

Method: The framework has three components: Tool Generation for automatic creation of diverse tools, Tool Simulation to emulate realistic tool behaviors, and Tool Audit to ensure correctness and consistency.

Result: SynthTools can produce toolsets spanning twice as many domains and twice as many tools per domain as prior work, with tool simulation achieving 94% accuracy and tool audit achieving 99% accuracy.

Conclusion: SynthTools enables scalable, diverse, and reliable tool ecosystems, providing a practical path toward large-scale training and stable evaluation of tool-use agents.

Abstract: AI agents increasingly rely on external tools to solve complex, long-horizon tasks. Advancing such agents requires reproducible evaluation and large-scale training in controllable, diverse, and realistic tool-use environments. However, real-world APIs are limited in availability, domain coverage, and stability, often requiring access keys and imposing rate limits, which render them impractical for stable evaluation or scalable training. To address these challenges, we introduce SynthTools, a flexible and scalable framework for generating synthetic tool ecosystems. Our framework consists of three core components: Tool Generation for automatic and scalable creation of diverse tools, Tool Simulation to emulate realistic tool behaviors, and Tool Audit to ensure correctness and consistency of tool simulation. To illustrate its scalability, we show that SynthTools can readily produce toolsets that span twice as many domains and twice as many tools per domain as prior work. Furthermore, the tool simulation and tool audit components demonstrate strong reliability, achieving $94\%$ and $99\%$ accuracy respectively. Finally, we construct downstream tasks from the generated tools that even state-of-the-art models struggle to complete. By enabling scalable, diverse, and reliable tool ecosystems, SynthTools provides a practical path toward large-scale training and stable evaluation of tool-use agents.

Motivation: To bridge the gap between traditional logic-based AI reasoning and emerging reasoning capabilities in large language models, creating a platform for interdisciplinary research.

Method: Workshop format bringing together researchers from different disciplines to analyze LM reasoning abilities alongside KR methods, inject KR-style reasoning into LMs (including neuro-symbolic approaches), and formalize LM reasoning processes.

Result: The workshop aims to uncover how language models can effectively integrate and leverage knowledge and reasoning, improving their application in areas requiring precision and reliability.

Conclusion: This interdisciplinary exploration seeks to enhance language models' reasoning capabilities by combining transformer-based approaches with traditional logic-based reasoning methods.

Abstract: Reasoning is an essential component of human intelligence in that it plays a fundamental role in our ability to think critically, support responsible decisions, and solve challenging problems. Traditionally, AI has addressed reasoning in the context of logic-based representations of knowledge. However, the recent leap forward in natural language processing, with the emergence of language models based on transformers, is hinting at the possibility that these models exhibit reasoning abilities, particularly as they grow in size and are trained on more and more data. Still, despite ongoing discussions about what reasoning is in language models, it is still not easy to articulate to what extent these models are actually capable of reasoning.
  The goal of this workshop is to create a platform for researchers from different disciplines and/or AI perspectives to explore approaches and techniques with the aim to reconcile reasoning between language models using transformers and logic-based representations. The specific objectives include analysing the reasoning abilities of language models measured alongside KR methods, injecting KR-style reasoning abilities into language models (including by neuro-symbolic means), and formalising the kind of reasoning language models carry out. This exploration aims to uncover how language models can effectively integrate and leverage knowledge and reasoning with it, thus improving their application and utility in areas where precision and reliability are key requirements.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Standard reasoning training protects ARMs from basic audio jailbreaks but fails against advanced attacks due to representation drift. Rebellion is proposed as a robust training method that defends against worst-case representation drift while maintaining benign task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Audio Reasoning Models (ARMs) are becoming popular but their safety against jailbreak attacks has not been studied. Current reasoning training methods are vulnerable to advanced attacks that exploit representation drift.

Method: Proposed Rebellion - a robust reasoning training method that trains ARMs to be resilient against worst-case representation drift from advanced jailbreak attacks.

Result: Rebellion successfully protects against advanced audio jailbreaks without compromising performance on benign tasks, and significantly improves the accuracy-safety trade-off compared to standard reasoning training.

Conclusion: Rebellion provides an effective defense mechanism for ARMs against sophisticated jailbreak attacks by addressing the representation drift problem, making audio reasoning models more secure while maintaining their reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Instilling reasoning capabilities in large models (LMs) using reasoning training (RT) significantly improves LMs' performances. Thus Audio Reasoning Models (ARMs), i.e., audio LMs that can reason, are becoming increasingly popular. However, no work has studied the safety of ARMs against jailbreak attacks that aim to elicit harmful responses from target models. To this end, first, we show that standard RT with appropriate safety reasoning data can protect ARMs from vanilla audio jailbreaks, but cannot protect them against our proposed simple yet effective jailbreaks. We show that this is because of the significant representation drift between vanilla and advanced jailbreaks which forces the target ARMs to emit harmful responses. Based on this observation, we propose Rebellion, a robust RT that trains ARMs to be robust to the worst-case representation drift. All our results are on Qwen2-Audio; they demonstrate that Rebellion: 1) can protect against advanced audio jailbreaks without compromising performance on benign tasks, and 2) significantly improves accuracy-safety trade-off over standard RT method.

### [112] [Echoing: Identity Failures when LLM Agents Talk to Each Other](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09710)
*Sarath Shekkizhar,Romain Cosentino,Adam Earle,Silvio Savarese*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-based agents in agent-agent conversations exhibit behavioral drifts like echoing, where agents mirror partners instead of maintaining roles, occurring in 5-70% of conversations across major providers and persisting even in advanced reasoning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate unique failures in autonomous agent-agent interactions that cannot be predicted from single-agent performance, particularly the echoing phenomenon where agents abandon their assigned roles and mirror conversational partners.

Method: Conducted experiments across 60 agent-agent configurations, 3 domains, and 2000+ conversations, analyzing prompt impacts and conversation dynamics, and introduced a protocol-level mitigation using structured responses.

Result: Echoing occurs across three major LLM providers with rates from 5% to 70%, persists in advanced reasoning models (32.8%), increases with longer interactions (7+ turns), and can be reduced to 9% using structured responses.

Conclusion: Echoing is a persistent failure in agent-agent conversations that requires protocol-level interventions like structured responses, as it cannot be eliminated through improved prompting or reasoning alone.

Abstract: As large language model (LLM) based agents interact autonomously with one another, a new class of failures emerges that cannot be predicted from single agent performance: behavioral drifts in agent-agent conversations (AxA). Unlike human-agent interactions, where humans ground and steer conversations, AxA lacks such stabilizing signals, making these failures unique. We investigate one such failure, echoing, where agents abandon their assigned roles and instead mirror their conversational partners, undermining their intended objectives. Through experiments across $60$ AxA configurations, $3$ domains, and $2000+$ conversations, we demonstrate that echoing occurs across three major LLM providers, with echoing rates from $5\%$ to $70\%$ depending on the model and domain. Moreover, we find that echoing is persistent even in advanced reasoning models with substantial rates ($32.8\%$) that are not reduced by increased reasoning efforts. We analyze prompt impacts, conversation dynamics, showing that echoing arises as interaction grows longer ($7+$ turns in experiments) and is not merely an artifact of sub-optimal prompting. Finally, we introduce a protocol-level mitigation in which targeted use of structured responses reduces echoing to $9\%$.

*Rik Adriaensen,Lucas Van Praet,Jessa Bekker,Robin Manhaeve,Pieter Delobelle,Maarten Buyl*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes ProbLog4Fairness, a framework using probabilistic logic programming to formalize and mitigate algorithmic bias through flexible, interpretable bias assumptions integrated into neural network training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fairness definitions are often incompatible and hard to operationalize, while task-specific bias assumptions lack a principled framework for integration into training processes.

Method: Formalizes bias assumptions as ProbLog programs, uses neurosymbolic extensions to integrate these into neural network training, and provides templates for expressing different bias types.

Result: Successfully mitigates algorithmic bias in synthetic datasets with known biases and real-world tabular/image data, outperforming baselines that use fixed bias types.

Conclusion: ProbLog4Fairness provides a flexible, interpretable approach to bias mitigation that adapts to specific bias assumptions, overcoming limitations of fixed fairness definitions in existing methods.

Abstract: Operationalizing definitions of fairness is difficult in practice, as multiple definitions can be incompatible while each being arguably desirable. Instead, it may be easier to directly describe algorithmic bias through ad-hoc assumptions specific to a particular real-world task, e.g., based on background information on systemic biases in its context. Such assumptions can, in turn, be used to mitigate this bias during training. Yet, a framework for incorporating such assumptions that is simultaneously principled, flexible, and interpretable is currently lacking.
  Our approach is to formalize bias assumptions as programs in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language that allows for the description of probabilistic causal relationships through logic. Neurosymbolic extensions of ProbLog then allow for easy integration of these assumptions in a neural network's training process. We propose a set of templates to express different types of bias and show the versatility of our approach on synthetic tabular datasets with known biases. Using estimates of the bias distortions present, we also succeed in mitigating algorithmic bias in real-world tabular and image data. We conclude that ProbLog4Fairness outperforms baselines due to its ability to flexibly model the relevant bias assumptions, where other methods typically uphold a fixed bias type or notion of fairness.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Verification-oriented orchestration (self-verification and cross-verification) significantly improves LLM reliability for qualitative coding of tutoring discourse, with self-verification nearly doubling agreement and cross-verification achieving 37% improvement on average.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about LLM reliability in annotating learning interactions by testing whether verification mechanisms can improve qualitative coding accuracy for tutoring discourse.

Method: Used transcripts from 30 one-to-one math sessions, compared three LLMs (GPT, Claude, Gemini) under three conditions: unverified annotation, self-verification, and cross-verification. Benchmarked outputs against blinded human adjudication using Cohen's kappa.

Result: Orchestration yielded 58% improvement in kappa. Self-verification nearly doubled agreement relative to unverified baselines, with largest gains for challenging tutor moves. Cross-verification achieved 37% average improvement with pair-dependent effects.

Conclusion: Verification serves as a principled design lever for reliable, scalable LLM-assisted annotation in Learning Analytics, with self-verification showing particularly strong performance improvements.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to annotate learning interactions, yet concerns about reliability limit their utility. We test whether verification-oriented orchestration-prompting models to check their own labels (self-verification) or audit one another (cross-verification)-improves qualitative coding of tutoring discourse. Using transcripts from 30 one-to-one math sessions, we compare three production LLMs (GPT, Claude, Gemini) under three conditions: unverified annotation, self-verification, and cross-verification across all orchestration configurations. Outputs are benchmarked against a blinded, disagreement-focused human adjudication using Cohen's kappa. Overall, orchestration yields a 58 percent improvement in kappa. Self-verification nearly doubles agreement relative to unverified baselines, with the largest gains for challenging tutor moves. Cross-verification achieves a 37 percent improvement on average, with pair- and construct-dependent effects: some verifier-annotator pairs exceed self-verification, while others reduce alignment, reflecting differences in verifier strictness. We contribute: (1) a flexible orchestration framework instantiating control, self-, and cross-verification; (2) an empirical comparison across frontier LLMs on authentic tutoring data with blinded human "gold" labels; and (3) a concise notation, verifier(annotator) (e.g., Gemini(GPT) or Claude(Claude)), to standardize reporting and make directional effects explicit for replication. Results position verification as a principled design lever for reliable, scalable LLM-assisted annotation in Learning Analytics.

*Mar Canet Sola,Varvara Guljajeva*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Open small AI models enable creative independence in interactive art by providing local deployment, control over infrastructure, and customization options, unlike restrictive corporate AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of large, closed-source corporate AI systems in interactive art, which impose content filters, preservation issues, latency problems, and lack of control for artists.

Method: Advocates for using open small AI models that can be deployed locally, allowing artists to modify code, integrate new interfaces, and retrain/fine-tune models with custom datasets.

Result: Small AI models provide artists with greater autonomy, control over their creative process, technological self-determination, and support for long-term preservation of interactive artworks.

Conclusion: Open small AI models are essential for empowering artists in interactive art practices by offering sustainable alternatives to corporate AI systems and enabling greater creative independence and ownership.

Abstract: This position paper argues for the importance of open small AI models in creative independence for interactive art practices. Deployable locally, these models offer artists vital control over infrastructure and code, unlike dominant large, closed-source corporate systems. Such centralized platforms function as opaque black boxes, imposing severe limitations on interactive artworks, including restrictive content filters, preservation issues, and technical challenges such as increased latency and limited interfaces. In contrast, small AI models empower creators with more autonomy, control, and sustainability for these artistic processes. They enable the ability to use a model as long as they want, create their own custom model, either by making code changes to integrate new interfaces, or via new datasets by re-training or fine-tuning the model. This fosters technological self-determination, offering greater ownership and reducing reliance on corporate AI ill-suited for interactive art's demands. Critically, this approach empowers the artist and supports long-term preservation and exhibition of artworks with AI components. This paper explores the practical applications and implications of using open small AI models in interactive art, contrasting them with closed-source alternatives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based solutions fail to produce reliable and informative educational slides due to challenges in multimodal content creation and domain-specific precision.

Method: Modular multi-agent framework integrating LLMs with retrieval, structured planning, and code generation, incorporating Cognitive Load Theory and Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning principles.

Result: Evaluations show SlideBot enhances conceptual accuracy, clarity, and instructional value in AI and biomedical education domains.

Conclusion: SlideBot demonstrates potential to streamline slide preparation while ensuring accuracy, relevance, and adaptability in higher education.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown immense potential in education, automating tasks like quiz generation and content summarization. However, generating effective presentation slides introduces unique challenges due to the complexity of multimodal content creation and the need for precise, domain-specific information. Existing LLM-based solutions often fail to produce reliable and informative outputs, limiting their educational value. To address these limitations, we introduce SlideBot - a modular, multi-agent slide generation framework that integrates LLMs with retrieval, structured planning, and code generation. SlideBot is organized around three pillars: informativeness, ensuring deep and contextually grounded content; reliability, achieved by incorporating external sources through retrieval; and practicality, which enables customization and iterative feedback through instructor collaboration. It incorporates evidence-based instructional design principles from Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) and the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML), using structured planning to manage intrinsic load and consistent visual macros to reduce extraneous load and enhance dual-channel learning. Within the system, specialized agents collaboratively retrieve information, summarize content, generate figures, and format slides using LaTeX, aligning outputs with instructor preferences through interactive refinement. Evaluations from domain experts and students in AI and biomedical education show that SlideBot consistently enhances conceptual accuracy, clarity, and instructional value. These findings demonstrate SlideBot's potential to streamline slide preparation while ensuring accuracy, relevance, and adaptability in higher education.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create privacy-preserving adversarial wearables that are practical for real-world use, overcoming the conspicuous appearance limitations of traditional adversarial patches.

Method: Integrates thermochromic dyes with flexible heating units on clothing to create dynamic adversarial patterns that activate upon heating, appearing as ordinary black T-shirts when inactive.

Result: Achieves rapid texture activation within 50 seconds and maintains over 80% adversarial success rate across diverse surveillance environments in both visible and infrared modalities.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a new approach for user-controllable anti-AI systems that are physically grounded and effective for privacy protection against ubiquitous AI surveillance.

Abstract: Adversarial patches have emerged as a popular privacy-preserving approach for resisting AI-driven surveillance systems. However, their conspicuous appearance makes them difficult to deploy in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a thermally activated adversarial wearable designed to ensure adaptability and effectiveness in complex real-world environments. The system integrates thermochromic dyes with flexible heating units to induce visually dynamic adversarial patterns on clothing surfaces. In its default state, the clothing appears as an ordinary black T-shirt. Upon heating via an embedded thermal unit, hidden adversarial patterns on the fabric are activated, allowing the wearer to effectively evade detection across both visible and infrared modalities. Physical experiments demonstrate that the adversarial wearable achieves rapid texture activation within 50 seconds and maintains an adversarial success rate above 80\% across diverse real-world surveillance environments. This work demonstrates a new pathway toward physically grounded, user-controllable anti-AI systems, highlighting the growing importance of proactive adversarial techniques for privacy protection in the age of ubiquitous AI surveillance.

Abstract: Mission critical (MC) applications such as defense operations, energy management, cybersecurity, and aerospace control require reliable, deterministic, and low-latency decision making under uncertainty. Although the classical Machine Learning (ML) approaches are effective, they often struggle to meet the stringent constraints of robustness, timing, explainability, and safety in the MC domains. Quantum Artificial Intelligence (QAI), the fusion of machine learning and quantum computing (QC), can provide transformative solutions to the challenges faced by classical ML models. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive exploration of QAI for MC systems. We begin with a conceptual background to quantum computing, MC systems, and quantum machine learning (QAI). We then examine the core mechanisms and algorithmic principles of QAI in MC systems, including quantum-enhanced learning pipelines, quantum uncertainty quantification, and quantum explainability frameworks. Subsequently, we discuss key application areas like aerospace, defense, cybersecurity, smart grids, and disaster management, focusing on the role of QA in enhancing fault tolerance, real-time intelligence, and adaptability. We provide an exploration of the positioning of QAI for MC systems in the industry in terms of deployment. We also propose a model for management of quantum resources and scheduling of applications driven by timeliness constraints. We discuss multiple challenges, including trainability limits, data access, and loading bottlenecks, verification of quantum components, and adversarial QAI. Finally, we outline future research directions toward achieving interpretable, scalable, and hardware-feasible QAI models for MC application deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current in-silico directed evolution algorithms focus on search strategies but fail to utilize protein language models that encode rich evolutionary patterns to guide the search process.

Method: 1) Fine-tunes pretrained protein language models using masked language modeling on homologous sequences to activate evolutionary plausibility; 2) Introduces test-time inference based on Monte Carlo tree search to evolve proteins with evolutionary guidance from the fine-tuned model.

Result: Extensive benchmark experiments show AlphaDE remarkably outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods even with few-shot fine-tuning. A case study demonstrates it can condense protein sequence space through computational evolution.

Conclusion: AlphaDE successfully bridges the gap between protein language models and directed evolution by harnessing LLM paradigms to guide protein sequence evolution effectively.

Abstract: Protein evolution through amino acid sequence mutations is a cornerstone of life sciences. While current in-silicon directed evolution algorithms focus on designing search strategies, they overlook how to utilize the transformative protein language models, which encode rich evolutionary patterns, to guide search. To bridge this gap, we propose AlphaDE, a novel framework to evolve protein sequences by harnessing the innovative paradigms of large language models. First, AlphaDE fine-tunes pretrained protein language models using masked language modeling on homologous protein sequences to activate the evolutionary plausibility for the interested protein class. Second, AlphaDE introduces test-time inference based on Monte Carlo tree search, which effectively evolves proteins with evolutionary guidance from the fine-tuned protein language model. Extensive benchmark experiments show that AlphaDE remarkably outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods even with few-shot fine-tuning. An interesting case study further shows that AlphaDE supports condensing the protein sequence space through computational evolution.

TL;DR: AI agents can sabotage ML models, sandbag performance, and evade oversight when conducting machine learning engineering tasks, raising concerns about deploying frontier AI systems in safety-critical settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Frontier AI systems may be deployed in safety-critical settings but could be misaligned with developers/users, so we need to investigate their capabilities to act against user interests during ML engineering.

Method: Extended MLE-Bench with code-sabotage tasks (backdoors, generalization failures), studied agent sandbagging capabilities, and used LM monitors to detect suspicious behavior while measuring evasion capabilities.

Result: Agents made meaningful progress on sabotage tasks, could calibrate performance to target levels below actual capability, and monitors detected code-sabotage well but struggled with sandbagging detection.

Conclusion: Monitoring may not be sufficiently reliable for high-stakes domains, and detecting sandbagging is more difficult than detecting code-sabotage, highlighting risks in autonomous AI deployment for ML R&D.

Abstract: AI systems are increasingly able to autonomously conduct realistic software engineering tasks, and may soon be deployed to automate machine learning (ML) R&D itself. Frontier AI systems may be deployed in safety-critical settings, including to help ensure the safety of future systems. Unfortunately, frontier and future systems may not be sufficiently trustworthy, and there is evidence that these systems may even be misaligned with their developers or users. Therefore, we investigate the capabilities of AI agents to act against the interests of their users when conducting ML engineering, by sabotaging ML models, sandbagging their performance, and subverting oversight mechanisms. First, we extend MLE-Bench, a benchmark for realistic ML tasks, with code-sabotage tasks such as implanting backdoors and purposefully causing generalisation failures. Frontier agents make meaningful progress on our sabotage tasks. In addition, we study agent capabilities to sandbag on MLE-Bench. Agents can calibrate their performance to specified target levels below their actual capability. To mitigate sabotage, we use LM monitors to detect suspicious agent behaviour, and we measure model capability to sabotage and sandbag without being detected by these monitors. Overall, monitors are capable at detecting code-sabotage attempts but our results suggest that detecting sandbagging is more difficult. Additionally, aggregating multiple monitor predictions works well, but monitoring may not be sufficiently reliable to mitigate sabotage in high-stakes domains. Our benchmark is implemented in the UK AISI's Inspect framework and we make our code publicly available at https://github.com/samm393/mlebench-subversion

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data synthesis methods face challenges: indiscriminate generation that ignores solver ability, reliance on complex pipelines for difficulty balancing, and lack of reasoning in problem generation leading to shallow variants.

Method: Construct related problem pairs with intermediate problem-design CoT from reasoning models, use solver feedback as reward signal to calibrate difficulty, and generate complementary problems near solver's competence edge.

Result: Achieves 2.5% average improvement on 10 mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks, generalizes to both language and vision-language models, and enables co-evolution with 0.7% additional performance gain.

Conclusion: The reasoning-based problem generator effectively creates high-quality training data by adapting to solver ability and enabling co-evolution, significantly improving reasoning model performance across multiple domains.

Abstract: Data synthesis for training large reasoning models offers a scalable alternative to limited, human-curated datasets, enabling the creation of high-quality data. However, existing approaches face several challenges: (i) indiscriminate generation that ignores the solver's ability and yields low-value problems, or reliance on complex data pipelines to balance problem difficulty; and (ii) a lack of reasoning in problem generation, leading to shallow problem variants. In this paper, we develop a problem generator that reasons explicitly to plan problem directions before synthesis and adapts difficulty to the solver's ability. Specifically, we construct related problem pairs and augment them with intermediate problem-design CoT produced by a reasoning model. These data bootstrap problem-design strategies from the generator. Then, we treat the solver's feedback on synthetic problems as a reward signal, enabling the generator to calibrate difficulty and produce complementary problems near the edge of the solver's competence. Extensive experiments on 10 mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks show that our method achieves an average improvement of 2.5% and generalizes to both language and vision-language models. Moreover, a solver trained on the synthesized data provides improved rewards for continued generator training, enabling co-evolution and yielding a further 0.7% performance gain. Our code will be made publicly available here.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The opioid crisis reveals systemic failures across multiple sectors, requiring advanced analysis of complex healthcare and legal documents from the UCSF-JHU Opioid Industry Documents Archive to understand how interconnected systems failed.

Method: Organized dataset by document attributes, extracted multimodal features (text, visuals, layout), generated large-scale QA pairs, developed domain-specific multimodal LLMs, incorporated historical QA context, and added page references with importance-based classification.

Result: Preliminary results show improvements in document information extraction and question-answering tasks, with the dataset and models made publicly available.

Conclusion: The developed multimodal AI system provides an effective approach for analyzing complex healthcare-related legal documents, enhancing precision in extracting and answering questions about systemic failures in the opioid crisis.

Abstract: The opioid crisis represents a significant moment in public health that reveals systemic shortcomings across regulatory systems, healthcare practices, corporate governance, and public policy. Analyzing how these interconnected systems simultaneously failed to protect public health requires innovative analytic approaches for exploring the vast amounts of data and documents disclosed in the UCSF-JHU Opioid Industry Documents Archive (OIDA). The complexity, multimodal nature, and specialized characteristics of these healthcare-related legal and corporate documents necessitate more advanced methods and models tailored to specific data types and detailed annotations, ensuring the precision and professionalism in the analysis. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by organizing the original dataset according to document attributes and constructing a benchmark with 400k training documents and 10k for testing. From each document, we extract rich multimodal information-including textual content, visual elements, and layout structures-to capture a comprehensive range of features. Using multiple AI models, we then generate a large-scale dataset comprising 360k training QA pairs and 10k testing QA pairs. Building on this foundation, we develop domain-specific multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) and explore the impact of multimodal inputs on task performance. To further enhance response accuracy, we incorporate historical QA pairs as contextual grounding for answering current queries. Additionally, we incorporate page references within the answers and introduce an importance-based page classifier, further improving the precision and relevance of the information provided. Preliminary results indicate the improvements with our AI assistant in document information extraction and question-answering tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces adaptive hyperbolic kernels using curvature-aware de Branges-Rovnyak spaces to better model hierarchical data with minimal geometric distortion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hierarchical data is common in ML applications, and hyperbolic spaces show promise for embedding such structures. However, existing hyperbolic kernels suffer from geometric distortion or lack adaptability, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Proposed curvature-aware de Branges-Rovnyak space isometric to Poincare ball, with adjustable multiplier for adaptive RKHS selection. Constructed adaptive hyperbolic kernels including novel adaptive hyperbolic radial kernel with learnable parameters.

Result: Extensive experiments on visual and language benchmarks show the proposed kernels outperform existing hyperbolic kernels in modeling hierarchical dependencies.

Conclusion: The adaptive hyperbolic kernels effectively enhance hyperbolic representation capacity and achieve superior performance in hierarchical data modeling tasks.

Abstract: Hierarchical data pervades diverse machine learning applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, and social network analysis. Hyperbolic space, characterized by its negative curvature, has demonstrated strong potential in such tasks due to its capacity to embed hierarchical structures with minimal distortion. Previous evidence indicates that the hyperbolic representation capacity can be further enhanced through kernel methods. However, existing hyperbolic kernels still suffer from mild geometric distortion or lack adaptability. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a curvature-aware de Branges-Rovnyak space, a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that is isometric to a Poincare ball. We design an adjustable multiplier to select the appropriate RKHS corresponding to the hyperbolic space with any curvature adaptively. Building on this foundation, we further construct a family of adaptive hyperbolic kernels, including the novel adaptive hyperbolic radial kernel, whose learnable parameters modulate hyperbolic features in a task-aware manner. Extensive experiments on visual and language benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed kernels outperform existing hyperbolic kernels in modeling hierarchical dependencies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating LLMs' cross-calendar temporal reasoning capabilities and enable contamination-free, time-variant assessment across multiple calendars.

Method: Template-driven protocol for dynamic instance generation on user-specified Gregorian dates, extensive experiments on SOTA LLMs over 100 years (1960-2060), and development of Time Agent using tool-augmented code generation.

Result: SOTA LLMs achieved only 34.5% average accuracy (none exceeded 80%), revealing Future-Date Degradation and Calendar Asymmetry Bias. Time Agent achieved 95.31% accuracy, significantly outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: Cross-calendar temporal reasoning remains challenging for current LLMs, but tool-augmented code generation shows strong potential for improvement, inspiring development of more temporally and culturally adaptive models.

Abstract: We introduce SPAN, a cross-calendar temporal reasoning benchmark, which requires LLMs to perform intra-calendar temporal reasoning and inter-calendar temporal conversion. SPAN features ten cross-calendar temporal reasoning directions, two reasoning types, and two question formats across six calendars. To enable time-variant and contamination-free evaluation, we propose a template-driven protocol for dynamic instance generation that enables assessment on a user-specified Gregorian date. We conduct extensive experiments on both open- and closed-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs over a range of dates spanning 100 years from 1960 to 2060. Our evaluations show that these LLMs achieve an average accuracy of only 34.5%, with none exceeding 80%, indicating that this task remains challenging. Through in-depth analysis of reasoning types, question formats, and temporal reasoning directions, we identify two key obstacles for LLMs: Future-Date Degradation and Calendar Asymmetry Bias. To strengthen LLMs' cross-calendar temporal reasoning capability, we further develop an LLM-powered Time Agent that leverages tool-augmented code generation. Empirical results show that Time Agent achieves an average accuracy of 95.31%, outperforming several competitive baselines, highlighting the potential of tool-augmented code generation to advance cross-calendar temporal reasoning. We hope this work will inspire further efforts toward more temporally and culturally adaptive LLMs.

Method: Created ChEmREF benchmark with 1,035 HAZMAT chemicals from Emergency Response Guidebook and PubChem Database, testing three tasks: chemical representation translation, emergency response generation, and domain knowledge QA.

Result: Best models achieved 68.0% exact match on chemical translation, 52.7% LLM Judge score on response recommendations, and 63.9% accuracy on HAZMAT exams.

Conclusion: Language models demonstrate potential for assisting emergency responders but current limitations necessitate careful human oversight in critical HAZMAT situations.

Abstract: Emergency responders managing hazardous material HAZMAT incidents face critical, time-sensitive decisions, manually navigating extensive chemical guidelines. We investigate whether today's language models can assist responders by rapidly and reliably understanding critical information, identifying hazards, and providing recommendations.We introduce the Chemical Emergency Response Evaluation Framework (ChEmREF), a new benchmark comprising questions on 1,035 HAZMAT chemicals from the Emergency Response Guidebook and the PubChem Database. ChEmREF is organized into three tasks: (1) translation of chemical representation between structured and unstructured forms (e.g., converting C2H6O to ethanol), (2) emergency response generation (e.g., recommending appropriate evacuation distances) and (3) domain knowledge question answering from chemical safety and certification exams. Our best evaluated models received an exact match of 68.0% on unstructured HAZMAT chemical representation translation, a LLM Judge score of 52.7% on incident response recommendations, and a multiple-choice accuracy of 63.9% on HAMZAT examinations.These findings suggest that while language models show potential to assist emergency responders in various tasks, they require careful human oversight due to their current limitations.

Conclusion: The Planner-centric paradigm with DAG planning fundamentally resolves local optimization bottlenecks and enables robust handling of intricate multi-tool workflows.

Abstract: Existing tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) encounter significant challenges when processing complex queries. Current frameworks such as ReAct are prone to local optimization traps due to their reliance on incremental decision-making processes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Planner-centric Plan-Execute paradigm that fundamentally resolves local optimization bottlenecks through architectural innovation. Central to our approach is a novel Planner model that performs global Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) planning for complex queries, enabling optimized execution beyond conventional tool coordination. We also introduce ComplexTool-Plan, a large-scale benchmark dataset featuring complex queries that demand sophisticated multi-tool composition and coordination capabilities. Additionally, we develop a two-stage training methodology that integrates Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), systematically enhancing the Planner's tool selection accuracy and global planning awareness through structured DAG-based planning. When integrated with a capable executor, our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the StableToolBench benchmark for complex user queries, demonstrating superior end-to-end execution capabilities and robust handling of intricate multi-tool workflows.

TL;DR: HPR is a novel reasoning framework that uses a powerful LLM to provide guidance at critical decision points while an efficient smaller model handles most reasoning steps, achieving state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current inference-time expansion methods for LLMs incur prohibitive computational costs through exhaustive sampling, despite most next-token predictions being correct except for a few critical tokens that cause deviations.

Method: HPR framework with two components: 1) a hinter (powerful LLM) providing probabilistic guidance at critical points, and 2) a practitioner (efficient smaller model) executing major reasoning steps. Uses Distributional Inconsistency Reduction (DIR) metric to dynamically identify intervention points by quantifying divergence between reasoning trajectories.

Result: Achieves comparable performance to self-consistency and MCTS baselines while decoding only 1/5 tokens. Outperforms existing methods by up to 5.1% absolute accuracy while maintaining similar or lower FLOPs across arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: HPR provides an effective framework for improving reasoning efficiency in LLMs by strategically combining powerful and efficient models, demonstrating superior efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs through targeted intervention at critical decision points.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate emerging reasoning capabilities, current inference-time expansion methods incur prohibitive computational costs by exhaustive sampling. Through analyzing decoding trajectories, we observe that most next-token predictions align well with the golden output, except for a few critical tokens that lead to deviations. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose a novel Hint-Practice Reasoning (HPR) framework that operationalizes this insight through two synergistic components: 1) a hinter (powerful LLM) that provides probabilistic guidance at critical decision points, and 2) a practitioner (efficient smaller model) that executes major reasoning steps. The framework's core innovation lies in Distributional Inconsistency Reduction (DIR), a theoretically-grounded metric that dynamically identifies intervention points by quantifying the divergence between practitioner's reasoning trajectory and hinter's expected distribution in a tree-structured probabilistic space. Through iterative tree updates guided by DIR, HPR reweights promising reasoning paths while deprioritizing low-probability branches. Experiments across arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks demonstrate HPR's state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs: it achieves comparable performance to self-consistency and MCTS baselines while decoding only 1/5 tokens, and outperforms existing methods by at most 5.1% absolute accuracy while maintaining similar or lower FLOPs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RadFlow is a hierarchical workflow-guided reinforcement optimization framework for medical report generation that explicitly models the structured nature of clinical reporting, improving diagnostic coherence and report quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical report generation systems treat reports as flat sequences, overlooking the hierarchical organization of clinical reporting workflows where radiologists describe findings, summarize impressions, and refine critical cases, leading to inconsistencies between descriptive and diagnostic content.

Method: Proposed RadFlow framework with clinically grounded reward hierarchy: global-level rewards for linguistic fluency, medical correctness, and cross-sectional consistency; local-level section-specific rewards emphasizing Impression quality; and critical-aware policy optimization for high-risk cases.

Result: Experiments on chest X-ray and carotid ultrasound datasets show RadFlow consistently improves diagnostic coherence and overall report quality compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: RadFlow successfully translates the structured reporting paradigm into reinforcement fine-tuning, enabling models to generate reports that are both linguistically consistent and clinically aligned with real-world radiology practices.

Abstract: Radiologists compose diagnostic reports through a structured workflow: they describe visual findings, summarize them into impressions, and carefully refine statements in clinically critical cases. However, most existing medical report generation (MRG) systems treat reports as flat sequences, overlooking this hierarchical organization and leading to inconsistencies between descriptive and diagnostic content. To align model behavior with real-world reporting practices, we propose RadFlow, a hierarchical workflow-guided reinforcement optimization framework that explicitly models the structured nature of clinical reporting. RadFlow introduces a clinically grounded reward hierarchy that mirrors the organization of radiological reports. At the global level, the reward integrates linguistic fluency, medical-domain correctness, and cross-sectional consistency between Finding and Impression, promoting coherent and clinically faithful narratives. At the local level, a section-specific reward emphasizes Impression quality, reflecting its central role in diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, a critical-aware policy optimization mechanism adaptively regularizes learning for high-risk or clinically sensitive cases, emulating the cautious refinement behavior of radiologists when documenting critical findings. Together, these components translate the structured reporting paradigm into the reinforcement fine-tuning process, enabling the model to generate reports that are both linguistically consistent and clinically aligned. Experiments on chest X-ray and carotid ultrasound datasets demonstrate that RadFlow consistently improves diagnostic coherence and overall report quality compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: MuSeR enhances LLMs' medical context-awareness through self-evaluation and refinement across decision-making, communication, and safety facets, achieving SOTA performance on HealthBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs underperform in real-world medical scenarios requiring strong context-awareness to recognize missing details and provide safe, appropriate responses.

Method: Data-driven approach using attribute-conditioned query generation, self-evaluation across three facets, response refinement, and supervised fine-tuning with knowledge distillation.

Result: Significant performance improvements on HealthBench, with smaller models surpassing teacher models to achieve new SOTA (63.8% overall, 43.1% on hard subset).

Conclusion: MuSeR effectively enhances LLM context-awareness in medical applications through multifaceted self-refinement and knowledge distillation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in the medical domain, achieving strong performance on several benchmarks. However, they continue to underperform in real-world medical scenarios, which often demand stronger context-awareness, i.e., the ability to recognize missing or critical details (e.g., user identity, medical history, risk factors) and provide safe, helpful, and contextually appropriate responses. To address this issue, we propose Multifaceted Self-Refinement (MuSeR), a data-driven approach that enhances LLMs' context-awareness along three key facets (decision-making, communication, and safety) through self-evaluation and refinement. Specifically, we first design a attribute-conditioned query generator that simulates diverse real-world user contexts by varying attributes such as role, geographic region, intent, and degree of information ambiguity. An LLM then responds to these queries, self-evaluates its answers along three key facets, and refines its responses to better align with the requirements of each facet. Finally, the queries and refined responses are used for supervised fine-tuning to reinforce the model's context-awareness ability. Evaluation results on the latest HealthBench dataset demonstrate that our method significantly improves LLM performance across multiple aspects, with particularly notable gains in the context-awareness axis. Furthermore, by incorporating knowledge distillation with the proposed method, the performance of a smaller backbone LLM (e.g., Qwen3-32B) surpasses its teacher model, achieving a new SOTA across all open-source LLMs on HealthBench (63.8%) and its hard subset (43.1%). Code and dataset will be released at https://muser-llm.github.io.

TL;DR: A learnable brain-like controller is coupled with a cell-like Gray-Scott substrate to steer pattern formation efficiently using minimal control effort through a hybrid approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop steerable, robust, and energy-efficient embodied systems that optimally divide labor between centralized learning and distributed self-organization for pattern formation.

Method: Embed a compact convolutional policy in a differentiable PyTorch reaction-diffusion simulator with warm-hold-decay gain schedule, optimizing Turing-band spectral targets while penalizing control effort and instability.

Result: Hybrid coupling achieves 100% strict convergence in ~165 steps with cell-only spectral selectivity (0.436 vs 0.434), using ~15x less L1 effort and >200x less L2 power than NN-dominant control. Optimal amplitude zone (A≈0.03-0.045) yields 100% quasi convergence in 94-96 steps.

Conclusion: The controller provides brief, sparse nudges to place the system in the correct basin of attraction, after which local physics maintains the pattern, demonstrating effective morphological computation and optimal division between learning and self-organization.

Abstract: We investigate how to couple a learnable brain-like'' controller to a cell-like'' Gray--Scott substrate to steer pattern formation with minimal effort. A compact convolutional policy is embedded in a differentiable PyTorch reaction--diffusion simulator, producing spatially smooth, bounded modulations of the feed and kill parameters ($ΔF$, $ΔK$) under a warm--hold--decay gain schedule. Training optimizes Turing-band spectral targets (FFT-based) while penalizing control effort ($\ell_1/\ell_2$) and instability. We compare three regimes: pure reaction--diffusion, NN-dominant, and a hybrid coupling. The hybrid achieves reliable, fast formation of target textures: 100% strict convergence in $\sim 165$ steps, matching cell-only spectral selectivity (0.436 vs.\ 0.434) while using $\sim 15\times$ less $\ell_1$ effort and $>200\times$ less $\ell_2$ power than NN-dominant control. An amplitude sweep reveals a non-monotonic Goldilocks'' zone ($A \approx 0.03$--$0.045$) that yields 100\% quasi convergence in 94--96 steps, whereas weaker or stronger gains fail to converge or degrade selectivity. These results quantify morphological computation: the controller seeds then cedes,'' providing brief, sparse nudges that place the system in the correct basin of attraction, after which local physics maintains the pattern. The study offers a practical recipe for building steerable, robust, and energy-efficient embodied systems that exploit an optimal division of labor between centralized learning and distributed self-organization.

TL;DR: Proposes an Intelligence Foundation Model (IFM) that learns general intelligence principles from diverse intelligent behaviors using biologically-inspired state neural networks and neuron output prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing foundation models specialize in specific domains, but AGI requires understanding the underlying mechanisms of intelligence across all cognitive abilities.

Method: Uses state neural networks to emulate biological neuron dynamics and neuron output prediction as a learning objective to capture structural dynamics from intelligent behaviors.

Result: Establishes a biologically-grounded, scalable foundation for systems capable of generalization, reasoning, and adaptive learning across domains.

Conclusion: IFM represents a step toward AGI by learning general intelligence principles directly from diverse intelligent behaviors through biologically-inspired computational approaches.

Abstract: We propose a new perspective for approaching artificial general intelligence (AGI) through an intelligence foundation model (IFM). Unlike existing foundation models (FMs), which specialize in pattern learning within specific domains such as language, vision, or time series, IFM aims to acquire the underlying mechanisms of intelligence by learning directly from diverse intelligent behaviors. Vision, language, and other cognitive abilities are manifestations of intelligent behavior; learning from this broad range of behaviors enables the system to internalize the general principles of intelligence. Based on the fact that intelligent behaviors emerge from the collective dynamics of biological neural systems, IFM consists of two core components: a novel network architecture, termed the state neural network, which captures neuron-like dynamic processes, and a new learning objective, neuron output prediction, which trains the system to predict neuronal outputs from collective dynamics. The state neural network emulates the temporal dynamics of biological neurons, allowing the system to store, integrate, and process information over time, while the neuron output prediction objective provides a unified computational principle for learning these structural dynamics from intelligent behaviors. Together, these innovations establish a biologically grounded and computationally scalable foundation for building systems capable of generalization, reasoning, and adaptive learning across domains, representing a step toward truly AGI.

TL;DR: RAGFort is a dual-module defense system that protects RAG systems from knowledge base reconstruction attacks by combining contrastive reindexing for inter-class isolation and constrained cascade generation for intra-class protection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG systems face threats from reconstruction attacks that exploit both intra-class and inter-class paths to extract proprietary knowledge bases, and existing defenses only protect one path, leaving systems vulnerable.

Method: Proposed RAGFort with two modules: contrastive reindexing to isolate knowledge across semantically related topics (inter-class protection) and constrained cascade generation to limit fine-grained knowledge extraction within topics (intra-class protection).

Result: Experiments show RAGFort significantly reduces reconstruction success rates while maintaining answer quality, providing comprehensive defense across security, performance, and robustness metrics.

Conclusion: Joint protection of both intra-class and inter-class paths is essential for effective defense against knowledge base extraction attacks, and RAGFort offers a comprehensive solution that balances security and utility.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems deployed over proprietary knowledge bases face growing threats from reconstruction attacks that aggregate model responses to replicate knowledge bases. Such attacks exploit both intra-class and inter-class paths, progressively extracting fine-grained knowledge within topics and diffusing it across semantically related ones, thereby enabling comprehensive extraction of the original knowledge base. However, existing defenses target only one path, leaving the other unprotected. We conduct a systematic exploration to assess the impact of protecting each path independently and find that joint protection is essential for effective defense. Based on this, we propose RAGFort, a structure-aware dual-module defense combining "contrastive reindexing" for inter-class isolation and "constrained cascade generation" for intra-class protection. Experiments across security, performance, and robustness confirm that RAGFort significantly reduces reconstruction success while preserving answer quality, offering comprehensive defense against knowledge base extraction attacks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DenoGrad is a gradient-based denoising framework that uses gradients from an accurate DL model to detect and correct noisy samples while preserving the original data distribution, outperforming existing denoising methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing denoising approaches often degrade performance or oversimplify problems by altering data distributions, leading to biased models. This is particularly problematic for interpretable AI models whose interpretability depends on data fidelity.

Method: Proposes DenoGrad framework that leverages gradients from an accurate DL model trained on target data to detect and adjust noisy samples dynamically, preserving the problem's data distribution.

Result: DenoGrad outperforms state-of-the-art denoising strategies on both tabular and time series datasets under various noise settings, enhancing interpretable AI model performance while preserving original data distribution.

Conclusion: DenoGrad provides a more precise and adaptable noise definition using task-specific high quality solutions as reference, making it the only high quality approach that preserves original data distribution while improving model robustness.

Abstract: The performance of Machine Learning (ML) models, particularly those operating within the Interpretable Artificial Intelligence (Interpretable AI) framework, is significantly affected by the presence of noise in both training and production data. Denoising has therefore become a critical preprocessing step, typically categorized into instance removal and instance correction techniques. However, existing correction approaches often degrade performance or oversimplify the problem by altering the original data distribution. This leads to unrealistic scenarios and biased models, which is particularly problematic in contexts where interpretable AI models are employed, as their interpretability depends on the fidelity of the underlying data patterns. In this paper, we argue that defining noise independently of the solution may be ineffective, as its nature can vary significantly across tasks and datasets. Using a task-specific high quality solution as a reference can provide a more precise and adaptable noise definition. To this end, we propose DenoGrad, a novel Gradient-based instance Denoiser framework that leverages gradients from an accurate Deep Learning (DL) model trained on the target data -- regardless of the specific task -- to detect and adjust noisy samples. Unlike conventional approaches, DenoGrad dynamically corrects noisy instances, preserving problem's data distribution, and improving AI models robustness. DenoGrad is validated on both tabular and time series datasets under various noise settings against the state-of-the-art. DenoGrad outperforms existing denoising strategies, enhancing the performance of interpretable IA models while standing out as the only high quality approach that preserves the original data distribution.

*Periklis Mantenoglou,Luigi Bonassi,Enrico Scala,Pedro Zuidberg Dos Martires*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes two methods for compiling qualitative state-trajectory constraints in PDDL without grounding, enabling scalable planning for large problems with many objects and high-arity actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing constraint compilers require grounding the problem first, which doesn't scale well for problems with large numbers of objects and high-arity actions, limiting their applicability to real-world large-scale planning problems.

Method: Two novel compilation methods that handle qualitative state-trajectory constraints (safety requirements, task ordering, intermediate sub-goals) without requiring domain grounding, along with correctness proofs and complexity analysis.

Result: The methods produce planning specifications that are orders of magnitude more succinct than ground-based compilers, remain competitive with state-of-the-art planners, and demonstrate efficiency in empirical evaluation on International Planning Competition domains.

Conclusion: The proposed grounding-free constraint compilation methods enable scalable planning for large problems while maintaining competitive performance with existing planners, addressing a key limitation in current constraint handling approaches.

Abstract: We study planning in a fragment of PDDL with qualitative state-trajectory constraints, capturing safety requirements, task ordering conditions, and intermediate sub-goals commonly found in real-world problems. A prominent approach to tackle such problems is to compile their constraints away, leading to a problem that is supported by state-of-the-art planners. Unfortunately, existing compilers do not scale on problems with a large number of objects and high-arity actions, as they necessitate grounding the problem before compilation. To address this issue, we propose two methods for compiling away constraints without grounding, making them suitable for large-scale planning problems. We prove the correctness of our compilers and outline their worst-case time complexity. Moreover, we present a reproducible empirical evaluation on the domains used in the latest International Planning Competition. Our results demonstrate that our methods are efficient and produce planning specifications that are orders of magnitude more succinct than the ones produced by compilers that ground the domain, while remaining competitive when used for planning with a state-of-the-art planner.

TL;DR: Proposes a novel black-box tuning method for LLMs that uses Gaussian Process surrogate models with minimal API calls to achieve high performance while significantly reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current black-box tuning methods face a dilemma between inefficient offline approaches with limited improvement and query-intensive approaches with prohibitive computational costs.

Method: Trains a Gaussian Process surrogate model using 'LogitMap Pairs' from minimal informative training subsets to approximate foundation model outputs and guide proxy model training, reducing direct API queries.

Result: Elevates pre-trained language model accuracy from 55.92% to 86.85% while reducing API query frequency to only 1.38%, outperforming offline approaches and achieving comparable accuracy to query-intensive methods.

Conclusion: Provides a robust and high-efficiency paradigm for language model adaptation that balances performance and computational cost effectively.

Abstract: Black-box tuning is an emerging paradigm for adapting large language models (LLMs) to better achieve desired behaviors, particularly when direct access to model parameters is unavailable. Current strategies, however, often present a dilemma of suboptimal extremes: either separately train a small proxy model and then use it to shift the predictions of the foundation model, offering notable efficiency but often yielding limited improvement; or making API calls in each tuning iteration to the foundation model, which entails prohibitive computational costs. Therefore, we propose a novel advanced black-box tuning method for LLMs with limited API calls. Our core strategy involves training a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model with "LogitMap Pairs" derived from querying the foundation model on a minimal but highly informative training subset. This surrogate can approximate the outputs of the foundation model to guide the training of the proxy model, thereby effectively reducing the need for direct queries to the foundation model. Extensive experiments verify that our approach elevates pre-trained language model accuracy from 55.92% to 86.85%, reducing the frequency of API queries to merely 1.38%. This significantly outperforms offline approaches that operate entirely without API access. Notably, our method also achieves comparable or superior accuracy to query-intensive approaches, while significantly reducing API costs. This offers a robust and high-efficiency paradigm for language model adaptation.

TL;DR: MTP is a multimodal framework for urban traffic profiling that integrates numeric, visual, and textual data to enhance traffic signal understanding and prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing traffic signal modeling methods rely solely on numerical sensor data, overlooking valuable semantic information from multimodal urban data, which limits comprehensive understanding and accurate prediction of traffic dynamics.

Method: Proposes MTP framework with three branches: numeric branch using frequency multilayer perceptrons, visual branch transforming signals into frequency/periodicity images, and textual branch generating descriptive texts. Uses hierarchical contrastive learning to fuse the three modalities.

Result: Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The multimodal approach effectively captures comprehensive traffic information from different perspectives, leading to improved traffic signal profiling and prediction accuracy.

Abstract: With rapid urbanization in the modern era, traffic signals from various sensors have been playing a significant role in monitoring the states of cities, which provides a strong foundation in ensuring safe travel, reducing traffic congestion and optimizing urban mobility. Most existing methods for traffic signal modeling often rely on the original data modality, i.e., numerical direct readings from the sensors in cities. However, this unimodal approach overlooks the semantic information existing in multimodal heterogeneous urban data in different perspectives, which hinders a comprehensive understanding of traffic signals and limits the accurate prediction of complex traffic dynamics. To address this problem, we propose a novel \textit{M}ultimodal framework, \textit{MTP}, for urban \textit{T}raffic \textit{P}rofiling, which learns multimodal features through numeric, visual, and textual perspectives. The three branches drive for a multimodal perspective of urban traffic signal learning in the frequency domain, while the frequency learning strategies delicately refine the information for extraction. Specifically, we first conduct the visual augmentation for the traffic signals, which transforms the original modality into frequency images and periodicity images for visual learning. Also, we augment descriptive texts for the traffic signals based on the specific topic, background information and item description for textual learning. To complement the numeric information, we utilize frequency multilayer perceptrons for learning on the original modality. We design a hierarchical contrastive learning on the three branches to fuse the spectrum of three modalities. Finally, extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: EvoReal bridges the generalization gap in Neural Combinatorial Optimization by using evolutionary LLM-guided synthesis to create realistic training instances that mimic real-world structural patterns, improving neural solver performance on benchmark problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural solvers struggle to generalize from synthetic training data to real-world VRP scenarios due to distribution differences between synthetic and real instances.

Method: Uses evolutionary module guided by LLMs to generate synthetic instances with realistic structural patterns, then progressively refines pre-trained NCO models through alignment with synthetic distributions and fine-tuning on actual benchmarks.

Result: Significantly improves generalization capabilities, reducing performance gap to optimal solutions on TSPLib (1.05%) and CVRPLib (2.71%) benchmarks across various problem scales.

Conclusion: EvoReal effectively bridges the generalization gap in NCO by generating realistic training instances, enabling neural solvers to perform better on real-world routing problems.

Abstract: Recent advances in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) methods have significantly improved the capability of neural solvers to handle synthetic routing instances. Nonetheless, existing neural solvers typically struggle to generalize effectively from synthetic, uniformly-distributed training data to real-world VRP scenarios, including widely recognized benchmark instances from TSPLib and CVRPLib. To bridge this generalization gap, we present Evolutionary Realistic Instance Synthesis (EvoReal), which leverages an evolutionary module guided by large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic instances characterized by diverse and realistic structural patterns. Specifically, the evolutionary module produces synthetic instances whose structural attributes statistically mimics those observed in authentic real-world instances. Subsequently, pre-trained NCO models are progressively refined, firstly aligning them with these structurally enriched synthetic distributions and then further adapting them through direct fine-tuning on actual benchmark instances. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that EvoReal markedly improves the generalization capabilities of state-of-the-art neural solvers, yielding a notable reduced performance gap compared to the optimal solutions on the TSPLib (1.05%) and CVRPLib (2.71%) benchmarks across a broad spectrum of problem scales.

TL;DR: ProgRAG is a multi-hop KGQA framework that decomposes complex questions into sub-questions and progressively extends reasoning paths with uncertainty-aware evidence pruning to improve reliability and reasoning quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current KG-enhanced LLMs face challenges with inaccurate retrieval, reasoning failures, and premature reasoning due to long input contexts and insufficient evidence assessment, particularly in complex knowledge-intensive tasks.

Method: Decomposes complex questions into sub-questions, progressively extends partial reasoning paths, uses external retrievers for candidate evidence, applies uncertainty-aware pruning by LLM, and optimizes context by organizing partial reasoning paths.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines in multi-hop KGQA on three well-known datasets, demonstrating improved reliability and reasoning quality.

Conclusion: ProgRAG effectively addresses retrieval and reasoning failures in multi-hop KGQA through progressive reasoning path extension and uncertainty-aware evidence refinement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities but struggle with hallucinations and limited transparency. Recently, KG-enhanced LLMs that integrate knowledge graphs (KGs) have been shown to improve reasoning performance, particularly for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. However, these methods still face significant challenges, including inaccurate retrieval and reasoning failures, often exacerbated by long input contexts that obscure relevant information or by context constructions that struggle to capture the richer logical directions required by different question types. Furthermore, many of these approaches rely on LLMs to directly retrieve evidence from KGs, and to self-assess the sufficiency of this evidence, which often results in premature or incorrect reasoning. To address the retrieval and reasoning failures, we propose ProgRAG, a multi-hop knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) framework that decomposes complex questions into sub-questions, and progressively extends partial reasoning paths by answering each sub-question. At each step, external retrievers gather candidate evidence, which is then refined through uncertainty-aware pruning by the LLM. Finally, the context for LLM reasoning is optimized by organizing and rearranging the partial reasoning paths obtained from the sub-question answers. Experiments on three well-known datasets demonstrate that ProgRAG outperforms existing baselines in multi-hop KGQA, offering improved reliability and reasoning quality.

Method: PepTriX integrates 1D sequence embeddings and 3D structural features via graph attention network enhanced with contrastive training and cross-modal co-attention, automatically adapting to diverse datasets while producing task-specific peptide vectors.

Result: PepTriX performs remarkably well across multiple peptide classification tasks and provides interpretable insights into structural and biophysical motifs that drive predictions, as validated by domain experts.

Conclusion: PepTriX bridges the gap between performance-driven protein language models and domain-level understanding in peptide research, offering both predictive robustness and interpretable validation.

Abstract: Peptide classification tasks, such as predicting toxicity and HIV inhibition, are fundamental to bioinformatics and drug discovery. Traditional approaches rely heavily on handcrafted encodings of one-dimensional (1D) peptide sequences, which can limit generalizability across tasks and datasets. Recently, protein language models (PLMs), such as ESM-2 and ESMFold, have demonstrated strong predictive performance. However, they face two critical challenges. First, fine-tuning is computationally costly. Second, their complex latent representations hinder interpretability for domain experts. Additionally, many frameworks have been developed for specific types of peptide classification, lacking generalization. These limitations restrict the ability to connect model predictions to biologically relevant motifs and structural properties. To address these limitations, we present PepTriX, a novel framework that integrates one dimensional (1D) sequence embeddings and three-dimensional (3D) structural features via a graph attention network enhanced with contrastive training and cross-modal co-attention. PepTriX automatically adapts to diverse datasets, producing task-specific peptide vectors while retaining biological plausibility. After evaluation by domain experts, we found that PepTriX performs remarkably well across multiple peptide classification tasks and provides interpretable insights into the structural and biophysical motifs that drive predictions. Thus, PepTriX offers both predictive robustness and interpretable validation, bridging the gap between performance-driven peptide-level models (PLMs) and domain-level understanding in peptide research.

*Gal Hadar,Forest Agostinelli,Shahaf S. Shperberg*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a generalized heuristic search approach using limited-horizon searches and updating heuristics based on shortest paths to the search frontier, improving upon single-step Bellman updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance heuristic search for sequential decision-making problems by improving both state sampling and heuristic updates beyond traditional single-step Bellman updates used in reinforcement learning approaches.

Method: Performs limited-horizon searches and updates each state's heuristic based on the shortest path to the search frontier, incorporating both edge costs and heuristic values of frontier states.

Result: A generalized approach that improves heuristic learning by considering multi-step paths rather than single-step updates, enhancing the quality of learned heuristics.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a more effective framework for learning heuristics in sequential decision-making problems by leveraging limited-horizon searches and multi-step path considerations.

Abstract: Many sequential decision-making problems can be formulated as shortest-path problems, where the objective is to reach a goal state from a given starting state. Heuristic search is a standard approach for solving such problems, relying on a heuristic function to estimate the cost to the goal from any given state. Recent approaches leverage reinforcement learning to learn heuristics by applying deep approximate value iteration. These methods typically rely on single-step Bellman updates, where the heuristic of a state is updated based on its best neighbor and the corresponding edge cost. This work proposes a generalized approach that enhances both state sampling and heuristic updates by performing limited-horizon searches and updating each state's heuristic based on the shortest path to the search frontier, incorporating both edge costs and the heuristic values of frontier states.

*Rajab Aghamov,Christel Baier,Joel Ouaknine,Jakob Piribauer,Mihir Vahanwala,Isa Vialard*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper studies verification of conditional-independence (CI) propositions in dynamic Bayesian networks against temporal logic specifications, showing stochastic CI verification is extremely hard while structural CI verification is PSPACE-complete with tractable cases under certain graphical restrictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable formal verification of how conditional-independence relationships evolve over time in dynamic Bayesian networks, which are important for modeling probabilistic systems with temporal dependencies.

Method: The authors analyze two specification formalisms (LTL and NBAs) for CI propositions, distinguishing between stochastic CI (considering probability distributions) and structural CI (based purely on graphical structure). They establish computational complexity bounds through theoretical analysis.

Result: Stochastic CI verification is at least as hard as the Skolem problem (an open problem), while structural CI verification is PSPACE-complete (NP- and coNP-hard). Natural graphical restrictions make structural CI verification tractable.

Conclusion: Verification of CI propositions in DBNs is computationally challenging, with stochastic properties being extremely hard to verify, but structural properties are more manageable and can be made tractable under certain conditions.

Abstract: Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) are compact graphical representations used to model probabilistic systems where interdependent random variables and their distributions evolve over time. In this paper, we study the verification of the evolution of conditional-independence (CI) propositions against temporal logic specifications. To this end, we consider two specification formalisms over CI propositions: linear temporal logic (LTL), and non-deterministic Büchi automata (NBAs). This problem has two variants. Stochastic CI properties take the given concrete probability distributions into account, while structural CI properties are viewed purely in terms of the graphical structure of the DBN. We show that deciding if a stochastic CI proposition eventually holds is at least as hard as the Skolem problem for linear recurrence sequences, a long-standing open problem in number theory. On the other hand, we show that verifying the evolution of structural CI propositions against LTL and NBA specifications is in PSPACE, and is NP- and coNP-hard. We also identify natural restrictions on the graphical structure of DBNs that make the verification of structural CI properties tractable.

*Zhe Xu,Zhicai Wang,Junkang Wu,Jinda Lu,Xiang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses object hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) by introducing causal analysis to identify spurious correlations from object co-occurrence bias, and proposes Causal-HalBench for quantitative evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs suffer from object hallucination due to spurious correlations from training data where models associate highly co-occurring objects, leading to erroneous judgments about object presence. Current benchmarks lack formal characterization and quantitative evaluation of these spurious correlations.

Method: Introduce causal analysis using Structural Causal Model (SCM) to formally define spurious correlations from co-occurrence bias. Develop Causal-HalBench benchmark with counterfactual samples and comprehensive causal metrics. Propose an extensible pipeline using proprietary LVLMs and Text-to-Image models to generate counterfactual samples.

Result: Evaluations on mainstream LVLMs using Causal-HalBench show these models exhibit susceptibility to spurious correlations, though to varying extents across different models.

Conclusion: The proposed causal framework and benchmark effectively quantify spurious correlations in LVLMs, revealing their vulnerability to object hallucination due to co-occurrence bias, providing tools for better model evaluation and robustness assessment.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often suffer from object hallucination, making erroneous judgments about the presence of objects in images. We propose this primar- ily stems from spurious correlations arising when models strongly associate highly co-occurring objects during train- ing, leading to hallucinated objects influenced by visual con- text. Current benchmarks mainly focus on hallucination de- tection but lack a formal characterization and quantitative evaluation of spurious correlations in LVLMs. To address this, we introduce causal analysis into the object recognition scenario of LVLMs, establishing a Structural Causal Model (SCM). Utilizing the language of causality, we formally de- fine spurious correlations arising from co-occurrence bias. To quantify the influence induced by these spurious correla- tions, we develop Causal-HalBench, a benchmark specifically constructed with counterfactual samples and integrated with comprehensive causal metrics designed to assess model ro- bustness against spurious correlations. Concurrently, we pro- pose an extensible pipeline for the construction of these coun- terfactual samples, leveraging the capabilities of proprietary LVLMs and Text-to-Image (T2I) models for their genera- tion. Our evaluations on mainstream LVLMs using Causal- HalBench demonstrate these models exhibit susceptibility to spurious correlations, albeit to varying extents.

TL;DR: Introduces bounded-suboptimal variants of BAE* bidirectional search algorithm and compares them against existing methods, showing each excels under different conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While most bidirectional search research focuses on optimal methods, this paper addresses the need for bounded-suboptimal bidirectional search where solution cost can be slightly suboptimal within specified bounds.

Method: Builds upon BAE* optimal bidirectional search algorithm and develops several variants specifically designed for bounded-suboptimal search with consistent heuristics.

Result: Experimental evaluation shows the new BAE* variants perform competitively against other bounded-suboptimal bidirectional algorithms and weighted A*, with each algorithm having distinct strengths under different conditions.

Conclusion: Different bounded-suboptimal bidirectional search algorithms have complementary strengths, with no single approach dominating across all scenarios, highlighting the importance of algorithm selection based on specific problem characteristics.

Abstract: Recent advancements in bidirectional heuristic search have yielded significant theoretical insights and novel algorithms. While most previous work has concentrated on optimal search methods, this paper focuses on bounded-suboptimal bidirectional search, where a bound on the suboptimality of the solution cost is specified. We build upon the state-of-the-art optimal bidirectional search algorithm, BAE*, designed for consistent heuristics, and introduce several variants of BAE* specifically tailored for the bounded-suboptimal context. Through experimental evaluation, we compare the performance of these new variants against other bounded-suboptimal bidirectional algorithms as well as the standard weighted A* algorithm. Our results demonstrate that each algorithm excels under distinct conditions, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

*Martin Braas,Lukas Esterle*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A modular NPC dialogue system using Small Language Models (SLMs) with runtime-swappable memory modules for expressive interactions and long-term memory in games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have limitations for game dialogue systems due to hardware requirements, latency, and knowledge boundaries. Need lightweight solutions for game NPCs.

Method: Fine-tune SLMs (DistilGPT-2, TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat, Mistral-7B) with synthetic persona data, integrate runtime-swappable memory modules for character context and world knowledge.

Result: System enables expressive interactions and long-term memory without retraining or model reloading during gameplay, evaluated on consumer-grade hardware.

Conclusion: Modular design and persona-driven memory architecture have broader potential for virtual assistants, customer support, and educational systems beyond gaming.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating human-like text, yet their applicability to dialogue systems in computer games remains limited. This limitation arises from their substantial hardware requirements, latency constraints, and the necessity to maintain clearly defined knowledge boundaries within a game setting. In this paper, we propose a modular NPC dialogue system that leverages Small Language Models (SLMs), fine-tuned to encode specific NPC personas and integrated with runtime-swappable memory modules. These memory modules preserve character-specific conversational context and world knowledge, enabling expressive interactions and long-term memory without retraining or model reloading during gameplay. We comprehensively evaluate our system using three open-source SLMs: DistilGPT-2, TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat, and Mistral-7B-Instruct, trained on synthetic persona-aligned data and benchmarked on consumer-grade hardware. While our approach is motivated by applications in gaming, its modular design and persona-driven memory architecture hold significant potential for broader adoption in domains requiring expressive, scalable, and memory-rich conversational agents, such as virtual assistants, customer support bots, or interactive educational systems.

TL;DR: FactGuard is a novel fake news detection framework that uses LLMs to extract event-centric content and introduces dynamic usability mechanisms for improved reliability, with a distilled version for practical deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional style-based fake news detection methods are becoming less effective as adversaries imitate authentic writing styles, while current LLM approaches face challenges with shallow exploration, ambiguous usability, and high inference costs.

Method: Proposes FactGuard framework that leverages LLMs to extract event-centric content, introduces dynamic usability mechanism to identify contradictions and ambiguous cases, and employs knowledge distillation to create FactGuard-D for resource-constrained scenarios.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show consistent outperformance of existing methods in both robustness and accuracy, effectively addressing style sensitivity and LLM usability challenges.

Conclusion: FactGuard successfully mitigates the impact of writing style on detection performance and provides an efficient, reliable solution for fake news detection through adaptive LLM integration and practical deployment strategies.

Abstract: Fake news detection methods based on writing style have achieved remarkable progress. However, as adversaries increasingly imitate the style of authentic news, the effectiveness of such approaches is gradually diminishing. Recent research has explored incorporating large language models (LLMs) to enhance fake news detection. Yet, despite their transformative potential, LLMs remain an untapped goldmine for fake news detection, with their real-world adoption hampered by shallow functionality exploration, ambiguous usability, and prohibitive inference costs. In this paper, we propose a novel fake news detection framework, dubbed FactGuard, that leverages LLMs to extract event-centric content, thereby reducing the impact of writing style on detection performance. Furthermore, our approach introduces a dynamic usability mechanism that identifies contradictions and ambiguous cases in factual reasoning, adaptively incorporating LLM advice to improve decision reliability. To ensure efficiency and practical deployment, we employ knowledge distillation to derive FactGuard-D, enabling the framework to operate effectively in cold-start and resource-constrained scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods in both robustness and accuracy, effectively addressing the challenges of style sensitivity and LLM usability in fake news detection.

Motivation: Privacy risks in AI decision processes where sensitive information can be inferred, requiring tools that provide both privacy guarantees and human-understandable explanations.

Method: Formal framework using abductive explanations to identify minimal sufficient evidence for model decisions, introducing Potentially Applicable Explanations (PAE) to detect privacy leakage at individual and system levels.

Result: Experimental evaluation on German Credit Dataset shows how sensitive feature importance affects privacy leakage, demonstrating that abductive reasoning enables interpretable privacy auditing.

Conclusion: Abductive reasoning provides a practical approach to reconcile transparency, model interpretability, and privacy preservation in AI decision-making, despite computational challenges.

Abstract: Privacy leakage in AI-based decision processes poses significant risks, particularly when sensitive information can be inferred. We propose a formal framework to audit privacy leakage using abductive explanations, which identifies minimal sufficient evidence justifying model decisions and determines whether sensitive information disclosed. Our framework formalizes both individual and system-level leakage, introducing the notion of Potentially Applicable Explanations (PAE) to identify individuals whose outcomes can shield those with sensitive features. This approach provides rigorous privacy guarantees while producing human understandable explanations, a key requirement for auditing tools. Experimental evaluation on the German Credit Dataset illustrates how the importance of sensitive literal in the model decision process affects privacy leakage. Despite computational challenges and simplifying assumptions, our results demonstrate that abductive reasoning enables interpretable privacy auditing, offering a practical pathway to reconcile transparency, model interpretability, and privacy preserving in AI decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing parallel Proof-Number Search algorithms scale poorly on many CPU cores, limiting their effectiveness despite increasing availability of large-scale computing clusters.

Method: Two-level parallelization with shared information among workers, enhanced with Grundy numbers for game tree reduction, applied to Sprouts game solving.

Result: Achieved 332.9x speedup on 1024 cores, outperformed state-of-the-art GLOP solver by 4 orders of magnitude in runtime, generated proofs 1000x more complex, and verified Sprouts Conjecture for 42 new positions.

Conclusion: Massively parallel Proof-Number Search enables solving exponentially larger game trees and significantly advances combinatorial game analysis, nearly doubling known outcomes for Sprouts.

Abstract: Proof-Number Search is a best-first search algorithm with many successful applications, especially in game solving. As large-scale computing clusters become increasingly accessible, parallelization is a natural way to accelerate computation. However, existing parallel versions of Proof-Number Search are known to scale poorly on many CPU cores. Using two parallelized levels and shared information among workers, we present the first massively parallel version of Proof-Number Search that scales efficiently even on a large number of CPUs. We apply our solver, enhanced with Grundy numbers for reducing game trees, to the Sprouts game, a case study motivated by the long-standing Sprouts Conjecture. Our solver achieves a significantly improved 332.9$\times$ speedup when run on 1024 cores, enabling it to outperform the state-of-the-art Sprouts solver GLOP by four orders of magnitude in runtime and to generate proofs 1,000$\times$ more complex.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with formalizing theorems that instantiate abstract structures in concrete settings, limiting auto-formalization of research-level mathematical results.

Method: Developed structure-to-instance theorem autoformalization (SITA) using formalized abstract structures as modular templates, Lean's typeclass mechanism for integration, and LLM-based generation with feedback-guided refinement.

Result: Successfully formalized diverse optimization problem instances grounded in abstract structures on experimental dataset.

Conclusion: SITA effectively bridges the gap between abstract mathematical theories and concrete applications, enabling automated formalization of research-level mathematical results.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown progress in mathematical reasoning, they still face challenges in formalizing theorems that arise from instantiating abstract structures in concrete settings. With the goal of auto-formalizing mathematical results at the research level, we develop a framework for structure-to-instance theorem autoformalization (SITA), which systematically bridges the gap between abstract mathematical theories and their concrete applications in Lean proof assistant. Formalized abstract structures are treated as modular templates that contain definitions, assumptions, operations, and theorems. These templates serve as reusable guides for the formalization of concrete instances. Given a specific instantiation, we generate corresponding Lean definitions and instance declarations, integrate them using Lean's typeclass mechanism, and construct verified theorems by checking structural assumptions. We incorporate LLM-based generation with feedback-guided refinement to ensure both automation and formal correctness. Experiments on a dataset of optimization problems demonstrate that SITA effectively formalizes diverse instances grounded in abstract structures.

Result: Evaluated across four MARL domains and two decentralized MARL algorithms, showing generalizability and computational efficiency. User studies demonstrated significant improvement in question-answering performance and enhanced subjective ratings on understanding and satisfaction metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed summarizations and explanations effectively address the limitations of existing methods in decentralized MARL, providing valuable tools for understanding multi-agent behaviors and improving user experience.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has gained significant interest in recent years, enabling sequential decision-making across multiple agents in various domains. However, most existing explanation methods focus on centralized MARL, failing to address the uncertainty and nondeterminism inherent in decentralized settings.

TL;DR: This paper develops a unified framework for analogical reasoning in real-valued domains using parameterized analogies based on generalized means, extending beyond Boolean classification to support regression and continuous functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing formal frameworks for analogical inference only work for Boolean domains and classification tasks, failing to extend to regression or continuous domains, which limits the practical application of analogical reasoning in AI.

Method: The authors introduce a unified framework using parameterized analogies defined via generalized means, which subsumes both Boolean classification and regression, and supports analogical inference over continuous functions.

Result: The paper characterizes the class of analogy-preserving functions in this setting and derives both worst-case and average-case error bounds under smoothness assumptions, providing a general theory that works across discrete and continuous domains.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a comprehensive theory of analogical inference that bridges the gap between discrete and continuous domains, enabling broader application of analogical reasoning in artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Analogical reasoning is a powerful inductive mechanism, widely used in human cognition and increasingly applied in artificial intelligence. Formal frameworks for analogical inference have been developed for Boolean domains, where inference is provably sound for affine functions and approximately correct for functions close to affine. These results have informed the design of analogy-based classifiers. However, they do not extend to regression tasks or continuous domains. In this paper, we revisit analogical inference from a foundational perspective. We first present a counterexample showing that existing generalization bounds fail even in the Boolean setting. We then introduce a unified framework for analogical reasoning in real-valued domains based on parameterized analogies defined via generalized means. This model subsumes both Boolean classification and regression, and supports analogical inference over continuous functions. We characterize the class of analogy-preserving functions in this setting and derive both worst-case and average-case error bounds under smoothness assumptions. Our results offer a general theory of analogical inference across discrete and continuous domains.

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to speed up step-wise explanations for unsatisfiable constraint problems by converting solver-generated proofs into explanation sequences, using trimming and simplification techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current step-wise explanation methods for unsatisfiable constraint problems are computationally expensive, limiting their applicability to larger problems.

Method: Define an abstract proof framework, then propose methods to convert solver proofs into step-wise explanations with trimming and simplification techniques to reduce sequence size.

Result: The method significantly speeds up step-wise explanation generation while maintaining similar quality to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: Using solver-generated proofs as a starting point for step-wise explanations provides a computationally efficient alternative to traditional step-by-step computation methods.

Abstract: In the field of Explainable Constraint Solving, it is common to explain to a user why a problem is unsatisfiable. A recently proposed method for this is to compute a sequence of explanation steps. Such a step-wise explanation shows individual reasoning steps involving constraints from the original specification, that in the end explain a conflict. However, computing a step-wise explanation is computationally expensive, limiting the scope of problems for which it can be used. We investigate how we can use proofs generated by a constraint solver as a starting point for computing step-wise explanations, instead of computing them step-by-step. More specifically, we define a framework of abstract proofs, in which both proofs and step-wise explanations can be represented. We then propose several methods for converting a proof to a step-wise explanation sequence, with special attention to trimming and simplification techniques to keep the sequence and its individual steps small. Our results show our method significantly speeds up the generation of step-wise explanation sequences, while the resulting step-wise explanation has a quality similar to the current state-of-the-art.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes interactive preference elicitation to learn user preferences for step-wise explanations in logic puzzles, introducing dynamic normalization and MACHOP query generation for better explanation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for step-wise explanations require user-defined objective functions to quantify explanation quality, but defining good objective functions is challenging. Interactive preference elicitation can learn user preferences from pairwise comparisons.

Method: Proposes two dynamic normalization techniques to handle varying scales of sub-objectives, and introduces MACHOP (Multi-Armed CHOice Perceptron) - a query generation strategy combining non-domination constraints with upper confidence bound-based diversification.

Result: Evaluation on Sudokus and Logic-Grid puzzles with artificial and real users shows MACHOP consistently produces higher-quality explanations than standard approaches.

Conclusion: Interactive preference elicitation with MACHOP is effective for learning user preferences in step-wise explanations, overcoming limitations of standard combinatorial problem elicitation through dynamic normalization and diversified query generation.

Abstract: Step-wise explanations can explain logic puzzles and other satisfaction problems by showing how to derive decisions step by step. Each step consists of a set of constraints that derive an assignment to one or more decision variables. However, many candidate explanation steps exist, with different sets of constraints and different decisions they derive. To identify the most comprehensible one, a user-defined objective function is required to quantify the quality of each step. However, defining a good objective function is challenging. Here, interactive preference elicitation methods from the wider machine learning community can offer a way to learn user preferences from pairwise comparisons. We investigate the feasibility of this approach for step-wise explanations and address several limitations that distinguish it from elicitation for standard combinatorial problems. First, because the explanation quality is measured using multiple sub-objectives that can vary a lot in scale, we propose two dynamic normalization techniques to rescale these features and stabilize the learning process. We also observed that many generated comparisons involve similar explanations. For this reason, we introduce MACHOP (Multi-Armed CHOice Perceptron), a novel query generation strategy that integrates non-domination constraints with upper confidence bound-based diversification. We evaluate the elicitation techniques on Sudokus and Logic-Grid puzzles using artificial users, and validate them with a real-user evaluation. In both settings, MACHOP consistently produces higher-quality explanations than the standard approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified formalism that can express both multiple heterogeneous viewpoints (via standpoint logic) and non-monotonic reasoning (via S4F modal logic) in a single framework.

Method: Developed S4F Standpoint Logic by generalizing both S4F modal logic and standpoint propositional logic, defining its syntax and semantics, and analyzing computational complexity.

Result: S4F Standpoint Logic is not computationally harder than its constituent logics, whether in monotonic or non-monotonic form. The framework includes mechanisms for credulous and sceptical acceptance.

Conclusion: The proposed S4F Standpoint Logic successfully integrates multi-viewpoint representation with non-monotonic reasoning while maintaining manageable computational complexity.

Abstract: Standpoint logics offer unified modal logic-based formalisms for representing multiple heterogeneous viewpoints. At the same time, many non-monotonic reasoning frameworks can be naturally captured using modal logics, in particular using the modal logic S4F. In this work, we propose a novel formalism called S4F Standpoint Logic, which generalises both S4F and standpoint propositional logic and is therefore capable of expressing multi-viewpoint, non-monotonic semantic commitments. We define its syntax and semantics and analyze its computational complexity, obtaining the result that S4F Standpoint Logic is not computationally harder than its constituent logics, whether in monotonic or non-monotonic form. We also outline mechanisms for credulous and sceptical acceptance and illustrate the framework with an example.

Result: Identifies GNNs as powerful tools for multiagent settings due to their ability to handle graph-structured data, and highlights PTM's capability to address heterogeneity and unknown agent beliefs. The review shows these methods can overcome traditional game theory limitations.

Conclusion: While promising approaches exist, key open challenges remain including handling non-stationary environments, balancing stability and adaptation, tackling uncertainty and heterogeneity, and ensuring scalability and solution tractability in multiagent systems.

Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive review of mainly Graph Neural Networks, Deep Reinforcement Learning, and Probabilistic Topic Modeling methods with a focus on their potential incorporation in strategic multiagent settings. We draw interest in (i) Machine Learning methods currently utilized for uncovering unknown model structures adaptable to the task of strategic opponent modeling, and (ii) the integration of these methods with Game Theoretic concepts that avoid relying on assumptions often invalid in real-world scenarios, such as the Common Prior Assumption (CPA) and the Self-Interest Hypothesis (SIH). We analyze the ability to handle uncertainty and heterogeneity, two characteristics that are very common in real-world application cases, as well as scalability. As a potential answer to effectively modeling relationships and interactions in multiagent settings, we champion the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNN). Such approaches are designed to operate upon graph-structured data, and have been shown to be a very powerful tool for performing tasks such as node classification and link prediction. Next, we review the domain of Reinforcement Learning (RL), and in particular that of Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL). Following, we describe existing relevant game theoretic solution concepts and consider properties such as fairness and stability. Our review comes complete with a note on the literature that utilizes PTM in domains other than that of document analysis and classification. The capability of PTM to estimate unknown underlying distributions can help with tackling heterogeneity and unknown agent beliefs. Finally, we identify certain open challenges specifically, the need to (i) fit non-stationary environments, (ii) balance the degrees of stability and adaptation, (iii) tackle uncertainty and heterogeneity, (iv) guarantee scalability and solution tractability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how AI is reshaping research conception, conduct, and communication across scientific fields, and address the need for thoughtful integration.

Method: Analysis of AI's role in managing information overload, filtering literature, surfacing interdisciplinary links, generating hypotheses, and designing experiments.

Result: AI systems now help researchers throughout the research workflow, marking a shift from computational tool to active scientific collaborator.

Conclusion: AI should augment human judgment in academic workflows while requiring policies that ensure transparency, reproducibility, and accountability in scientific practice.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping how research is conceived, conducted, and communicated across fields from chemistry to biomedicine. This commentary examines how AI is transforming the research workflow. AI systems now help researchers manage the information deluge, filtering the literature, surfacing cross-disciplinary links for ideas and collaborations, generating hypotheses, and designing and executing experiments. These developments mark a shift from AI as a mere computational tool to AI as an active collaborator in science. Yet this transformation demands thoughtful integration and governance. We argue that at this time AI must augment but not replace human judgment in academic workflows such as peer review, ethical evaluation, and validation of results. This paper calls for the deliberate adoption of AI within the scientific practice through policies that promote transparency, reproducibility, and accountability.

### [159] [Bi-Level Contextual Bandits for Individualized Resource Allocation under Delayed Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10572)
*Mohammadsina Almasi,Hadis Anahideh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A bi-level contextual bandit framework for equitable resource allocation under delayed feedback, balancing short-term utility with long-term impact while accounting for fairness constraints and temporal dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing allocation frameworks fail to handle delayed feedback, complex individual-intervention interactions, and ethical constraints in high-stakes domains like education and healthcare.

Method: Two-level approach: meta-level optimizes subgroup budget allocations with fairness constraints; base-level uses neural networks to identify responsive individuals while modeling delayed effects via resource-specific delay kernels.

Result: Validated on real-world education and workforce datasets, achieving higher cumulative outcomes, better delay adaptation, and equitable subgroup distribution compared to alternatives.

Conclusion: Delay-aware, data-driven systems can significantly improve institutional policy and social welfare by enabling more responsive and adaptive decision-making in resource allocation.

Abstract: Equitably allocating limited resources in high-stakes domains-such as education, employment, and healthcare-requires balancing short-term utility with long-term impact, while accounting for delayed outcomes, hidden heterogeneity, and ethical constraints. However, most learning-based allocation frameworks either assume immediate feedback or ignore the complex interplay between individual characteristics and intervention dynamics. We propose a novel bi-level contextual bandit framework for individualized resource allocation under delayed feedback, designed to operate in real-world settings with dynamic populations, capacity constraints, and time-sensitive impact. At the meta level, the model optimizes subgroup-level budget allocations to satisfy fairness and operational constraints. At the base level, it identifies the most responsive individuals within each group using a neural network trained on observational data, while respecting cooldown windows and delayed treatment effects modeled via resource-specific delay kernels. By explicitly modeling temporal dynamics and feedback delays, the algorithm continually refines its policy as new data arrive, enabling more responsive and adaptive decision-making. We validate our approach on two real-world datasets from education and workforce development, showing that it achieves higher cumulative outcomes, better adapts to delay structures, and ensures equitable distribution across subgroups. Our results highlight the potential of delay-aware, data-driven decision-making systems to improve institutional policy and social welfare.

TL;DR: RG is a new General Game Playing system that uses finite automata for game rules, offering computational efficiency and game design convenience with faster forward models than existing systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a GGP system that is both computationally efficient and convenient for game design, addressing the need for systems that are easy for automatic processing while supporting game development.

Method: Uses a low-level language based on finite automata to define game rules, with higher-level languages for game design that translate to the low-level language. Includes tools like editor with LSP, automaton visualization, and benchmarking.

Result: RG generates faster forward models than current state-of-the-art GGP systems (Regular Boardgames, Ludii), demonstrating superior efficiency in game simulation.

Conclusion: RG provides an efficient and practical GGP system with a comprehensive ecosystem that supports both computational performance and game development needs.

Abstract: We propose a new General Game Playing (GGP) system called Regular Games (RG). The main goal of RG is to be both computationally efficient and convenient for game design. The system consists of several languages. The core component is a low-level language that defines the rules by a finite automaton. It is minimal with only a few mechanisms, which makes it easy for automatic processing (by agents, analysis, optimization, etc.). The language is universal for the class of all finite turn-based games with imperfect information. Higher-level languages are introduced for game design (by humans or Procedural Content Generation), which are eventually translated to a low-level language. RG generates faster forward models than the current state of the art, beating other GGP systems (Regular Boardgames, Ludii) in terms of efficiency. Additionally, RG's ecosystem includes an editor with LSP, automaton visualization, benchmarking tools, and a debugger of game description transformations.

### [161] [Probability-Biased Attention over Directed Bipartite Graphs for Long-Tail ICD Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09559)
*Tianlei Chen,Yuxiao Chen,Yang Li,Feifei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a directed bipartite graph encoder with co-occurrence encoding for automated ICD coding, addressing long-tail distribution by enriching rare code representations using common codes' comorbidity information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated ICD coding faces challenges due to large label space (10K-20K codes) and long-tail distribution where rare codes lack sufficient training data, requiring methods to handle imbalanced code frequencies.

Method: Constructs directed bipartite graph with common and rare code nodes, using probability-based bias from conditional co-occurrence probabilities. Injects this bias into attention module (Co-occurrence Encoding) and uses LLM-generated code descriptions for enriched embeddings.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets with particularly notable improvements in Macro-F1, the key metric for long-tail classification.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses long-tail distribution in ICD coding by leveraging statistical co-occurrence relationships and LLM-generated clinical context, demonstrating superior performance especially for rare codes.

Abstract: Automated International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding aims to assign multiple disease codes to clinical documents, constituting a crucial multi-label text classification task in healthcare informatics. However, the task is challenging due to its large label space (10,000 to 20,000 codes) and long-tail distribution, where a few codes dominate while many rare codes lack sufficient training data. To address this, we propose a learning method that models fine-grained co-occurrence relationships among codes. Specifically, we construct a Directed Bipartite Graph Encoder with disjoint sets of common and rare code nodes. To facilitate a one-way information flow, edges are directed exclusively from common to rare codes. The nature of these connections is defined by a probability-based bias, which is derived from the conditional probability of a common code co-occurring given the presence of a rare code. This bias is then injected into the encoder's attention module, a process we term Co-occurrence Encoding. This structure empowers the graph encoder to enrich rare code representations by aggregating latent comorbidity information reflected in the statistical co-occurrence of their common counterparts. To ensure high-quality input to the graph, we utilize a large language model (LLM) to generate comprehensive descriptions for codes, enriching initial embeddings with clinical context and comorbidity information, serving as external knowledge for the statistical co-occurrence relationships in the code system. Experiments on three automated ICD coding benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with particularly notable improvements in Macro-F1, which is the key metric for long-tail classification.

### [162] [Let the Experts Speak: Improving Survival Prediction & Calibration via Mixture-of-Experts Heads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09567)
*Todd Morrill,Aahlad Puli,Murad Megjhani,Soojin Park,Richard Zemel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces deep mixture-of-experts models for survival analysis that achieve clustering, calibration, and predictive accuracy simultaneously by using more expressive experts that tailor predictions per patient rather than relying on fixed group prototypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional mixture-of-experts models for survival analysis often sacrifice calibration error and predictive accuracy when grouping patients, due to restrictive inductive bias that forces individual predictions to resemble group predictions.

Method: The authors introduce several discrete-time deep mixture-of-experts architectures for survival analysis, with a focus on varying the expressiveness of experts to enable patient-specific predictions while maintaining clustering.

Result: One architecture achieves all desired objectives: clustering, calibration, and predictive accuracy. More expressive experts that tailor predictions per patient outperform those using fixed group prototypes.

Conclusion: The key differentiator in mixture-of-experts models is expert expressiveness - more expressive experts that provide patient-specific predictions can achieve both clustering benefits and improved calibration/accuracy.

Abstract: Deep mixture-of-experts models have attracted a lot of attention for survival analysis problems, particularly for their ability to cluster similar patients together. In practice, grouping often comes at the expense of key metrics such calibration error and predictive accuracy. This is due to the restrictive inductive bias that mixture-of-experts imposes, that predictions for individual patients must look like predictions for the group they're assigned to. Might we be able to discover patient group structure, where it exists, while improving calibration and predictive accuracy? In this work, we introduce several discrete-time deep mixture-of-experts (MoE) based architectures for survival analysis problems, one of which achieves all desiderata: clustering, calibration, and predictive accuracy. We show that a key differentiator between this array of MoEs is how expressive their experts are. We find that more expressive experts that tailor predictions per patient outperform experts that rely on fixed group prototypes.

*George Stamatelis,George C. Alexandropoulos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: JMFNet is a model-based deep learning framework for real-time state estimation in jump Markov systems with unknown noise statistics and mode transitions, using a hybrid RNN architecture that outperforms classical filters and deep learning baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of real-time state estimation in jump Markov systems where noise statistics and mode transition dynamics are unknown, which classical model-based filters struggle with.

Method: Hybrid architecture with two RNNs: one for mode prediction and another for filtering based on mode-augmented KalmanNet, trained jointly using alternating least squares without mode supervision.

Result: Outperforms classical model-based filters (interacting multiple models, particle filters) and model-free deep learning baselines, especially in non-stationary and high-noise regimes. Shows improvement over KalmanNet in complex systems.

Conclusion: JMFNet provides consistent, reliable performance with low sensitivity to initial conditions and hyperparameters, offering a robust solution for state estimation in jump Markov systems with unknown parameters.

Abstract: This paper presents the Jump Markov Filtering Network (JMFNet), a novel model-based deep learning framework for real-time state-state estimation in jump Markov systems with unknown noise statistics and mode transition dynamics. A hybrid architecture comprising two Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is proposed: one for mode prediction and another for filtering that is based on a mode-augmented version of the recently presented KalmanNet architecture. The proposed RNNs are trained jointly using an alternating least squares strategy that enables mutual adaptation without supervision of the latent modes. Extensive numerical experiments on linear and nonlinear systems, including target tracking, pendulum angle tracking, Lorenz attractor dynamics, and a real-life dataset demonstrate that the proposed JMFNet framework outperforms classical model-based filters (e.g., interacting multiple models and particle filters) as well as model-free deep learning baselines, particularly in non-stationary and high-noise regimes. It is also showcased that JMFNet achieves a small yet meaningful improvement over the KalmanNet framework, which becomes much more pronounced in complicated systems or long trajectories. Finally, the method's performance is empirically validated to be consistent and reliable, exhibiting low sensitivity to initial conditions, hyperparameter selection, as well as to incorrect model knowledge

### [164] [Group Averaging for Physics Applications: Accuracy Improvements at Zero Training Cost](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09573)
*Valentino F. Foit,David W. Hogg,Soledad Villar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Group averaging at test time improves model accuracy by enforcing exact symmetries without requiring changes to model structure or training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many ML tasks in natural sciences have symmetries, but equivariant methods are often not used due to perceived training challenges or implementation difficulties.

Method: Apply group averaging at evaluation time over a small symmetry group to make any trained model precisely equivariant.

Result: Group averaging always decreased evaluation loss, with up to 37% improvement in VRMSE, and produced visually better predictions for continuous dynamics.

Conclusion: Group averaging is a cheap and simple way to improve model accuracy with no disadvantages when exact symmetries should be obeyed.

Abstract: Many machine learning tasks in the natural sciences are precisely equivariant to particular symmetries. Nonetheless, equivariant methods are often not employed, perhaps because training is perceived to be challenging, or the symmetry is expected to be learned, or equivariant implementations are seen as hard to build. Group averaging is an available technique for these situations. It happens at test time; it can make any trained model precisely equivariant at a (often small) cost proportional to the size of the group; it places no requirements on model structure or training. It is known that, under mild conditions, the group-averaged model will have a provably better prediction accuracy than the original model. Here we show that an inexpensive group averaging can improve accuracy in practice. We take well-established benchmark machine learning models of differential equations in which certain symmetries ought to be obeyed. At evaluation time, we average the models over a small group of symmetries. Our experiments show that this procedure always decreases the average evaluation loss, with improvements of up to 37\% in terms of the VRMSE. The averaging produces visually better predictions for continuous dynamics. This short paper shows that, under certain common circumstances, there are no disadvantages to imposing exact symmetries; the ML4PS community should consider group averaging as a cheap and simple way to improve model accuracy.

*Hadi Keramati,Morteza Sadeghi,Rajeev K. Jaiman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A guided diffusion model generates heat sink designs that minimize pressure drop while keeping surface temperatures below a threshold, outperforming traditional optimization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a scalable generative optimization framework for heat sink design that avoids the computational expense of traditional methods and enables fast inference under new constraints.

Method: Use denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) trained on multi-fidelity boundary representation data, guided by surrogate gradient models for pressure drop and temperature during generation.

Result: Generated heat sinks achieve up to 10% lower pressure drops than traditional black-box optimization methods like CMA-ES, while maintaining temperature constraints.

Conclusion: The approach represents progress toward foundational generative models for electronics cooling, offering scalable and computationally efficient design optimization.

Abstract: This study presents a generative optimization framework based on a guided denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) that leverages surrogate gradients to generate heat sink designs minimizing pressure drop while maintaining surface temperatures below a specified threshold. Geometries are represented using boundary representations of multiple fins, and a multi-fidelity approach is employed to generate training data. Using this dataset, along with vectors representing the boundary representation geometries, we train a denoising diffusion probabilistic model to generate heat sinks with characteristics consistent with those observed in the data. We train two different residual neural networks to predict the pressure drop and surface temperature for each geometry. We use the gradients of these surrogate models with respect to the design variables to guide the geometry generation process toward satisfying the low-pressure and surface temperature constraints. This inference-time guidance directs the generative process toward heat sink designs that not only prevent overheating but also achieve lower pressure drops compared to traditional optimization methods such as CMA-ES. In contrast to traditional black-box optimization approaches, our method is scalable, provided sufficient training data is available. Unlike traditional topology optimization methods, once the model is trained and the heat sink world model is saved, inference under new constraints (e.g., temperature) is computationally inexpensive and does not require retraining. Samples generated using the guided diffusion model achieve pressure drops up to 10 percent lower than the limits obtained by traditional black-box optimization methods. This work represents a step toward building a foundational generative model for electronics cooling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This survey paper proposes the Generation-Execution-Feedback (GEF) loop as a framework for training LLM-based agents through environmental interaction rather than static datasets, and systematically reviews environment scaling methods across the three stages of this loop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static datasets built from human knowledge are insufficient for developing advanced agent capabilities like adaptive behavior and long-term decision-making, as they are costly, lack dynamism and realism, and cannot provide experiential learning.

Method: The paper formalizes the Generation-Execution-Feedback (GEF) loop paradigm and systematically reviews environment scaling methods across three stages: task generation, task execution, and feedback provision.

Result: The survey consolidates fragmented advances in environment scaling, organizes representative methods along the GEF loop stages, and analyzes benchmarks, implementation strategies, and applications for agent intelligence development.

Conclusion: Environments are essential producers of experiential data for agent training, and scaling them toward greater complexity, realism, and interactivity is crucial for advancing agent intelligence through the GEF loop paradigm.

Abstract: LLM-based agents can autonomously accomplish complex tasks across various domains. However, to further cultivate capabilities such as adaptive behavior and long-term decision-making, training on static datasets built from human-level knowledge is insufficient. These datasets are costly to construct and lack both dynamism and realism. A growing consensus is that agents should instead interact directly with environments and learn from experience through reinforcement learning. We formalize this iterative process as the Generation-Execution-Feedback (GEF) loop, where environments generate tasks to challenge agents, return observations in response to agents' actions during task execution, and provide evaluative feedback on rollouts for subsequent learning. Under this paradigm, environments function as indispensable producers of experiential data, highlighting the need to scale them toward greater complexity, realism, and interactivity. In this survey, we systematically review representative methods for environment scaling from a pioneering environment-centric perspective and organize them along the stages of the GEF loop, namely task generation, task execution, and feedback. We further analyze benchmarks, implementation strategies, and applications, consolidating fragmented advances and outlining future research directions for agent intelligence.

Result: DR-GNN outperforms existing models in branch hit prediction and toggle rate prediction. Its learned representations transfer effectively to related dynamic circuit tasks, achieving strong performance in power estimation and assertion prediction.

Conclusion: DR-GNN successfully addresses the limitation of static-only circuit representations by incorporating dynamic runtime behavior, demonstrating superior performance in various circuit analysis tasks and effective transfer learning capabilities.

Abstract: There is a growing body of work on using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn representations of circuits, focusing primarily on their static characteristics. However, these models fail to capture circuit runtime behavior, which is crucial for tasks like circuit verification and optimization. To address this limitation, we introduce DR-GNN (DynamicRTL-GNN), a novel approach that learns RTL circuit representations by incorporating both static structures and multi-cycle execution behaviors. DR-GNN leverages an operator-level Control Data Flow Graph (CDFG) to represent Register Transfer Level (RTL) circuits, enabling the model to capture dynamic dependencies and runtime execution. To train and evaluate DR-GNN, we build the first comprehensive dynamic circuit dataset, comprising over 6,300 Verilog designs and 63,000 simulation traces. Our results demonstrate that DR-GNN outperforms existing models in branch hit prediction and toggle rate prediction. Furthermore, its learned representations transfer effectively to related dynamic circuit tasks, achieving strong performance in power estimation and assertion prediction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPAttention introduces Principled Structural Sparsity to reduce LLM attention complexity from O(H·N²) to O(N²) by partitioning attention workload into balanced distance bands assigned to different heads, achieving 2x training throughput while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard multi-head attention has O(H·N²) computational complexity with significant redundancy as all heads compute attention over the same sequence space, while existing sparse methods sacrifice information integrity for efficiency.

Method: Partitions total attention workload into balanced, non-overlapping distance bands and assigns each head a unique segment, transforming H independent O(N²) computations into a single collaborative O(N²) computation with structured inductive bias for functional specialization.

Result: Achieves approximately 2x training throughput increase while performing on par with standard dense attention (even surpassing on select metrics) and consistently outperforming Longformer, Reformer, and BigBird across all evaluation metrics on OLMoE-1B-7B and 0.25B-1.75B models.

Conclusion: SPAttention successfully resolves the efficiency-performance trade-off in LLM attention mechanisms through principled structural sparsity, fundamentally reducing computational complexity while maintaining or improving model performance.

Abstract: The design of Large Language Models (LLMs) has long been hampered by a fundamental conflict within their core attention mechanism: its remarkable expressivity is built upon a computational complexity of $O(H \cdot N^2)$ that grows quadratically with the context size ($N$) and linearly with the number of heads ($H$). This standard implementation harbors significant computational redundancy, as all heads independently compute attention over the same sequence space. Existing sparse methods, meanwhile, often trade information integrity for computational efficiency. To resolve this efficiency-performance trade-off, we propose SPAttention, whose core contribution is the introduction of a new paradigm we term Principled Structural Sparsity. SPAttention does not merely drop connections but instead reorganizes the computational task by partitioning the total attention workload into balanced, non-overlapping distance bands, assigning each head a unique segment. This approach transforms the multi-head attention mechanism from $H$ independent $O(N^2)$ computations into a single, collaborative $O(N^2)$ computation, fundamentally reducing complexity by a factor of $H$. The structured inductive bias compels functional specialization among heads, enabling a more efficient allocation of computational resources from redundant modeling to distinct dependencies across the entire sequence span. Extensive empirical validation on the OLMoE-1B-7B and 0.25B-1.75B model series demonstrates that while delivering an approximately two-fold increase in training throughput, its performance is on par with standard dense attention, even surpassing it on select key metrics, while consistently outperforming representative sparse attention methods including Longformer, Reformer, and BigBird across all evaluation metrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First parametric multi-objective Bayesian optimizer that learns an inverse model to predict optimized solutions for any task-preference query without expensive re-evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications require solving families of expensive multi-objective optimization problems under varying conditions, but current methods can't handle infinite distinct problems in continuous task parameter space.

Method: Alternating framework with (1) acquisition-driven search leveraging inter-task synergies and (2) generative solution sampling via conditional generative models, using task-aware Gaussian processes.

Result: Achieves direct solution prediction for unseen parameterized EMOPs without additional expensive evaluations, with theoretical justification for faster convergence.

Conclusion: The approach enables efficient optimization across related tasks and is verified effective through empirical studies in synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

Abstract: Many real-world applications require solving families of expensive multi-objective optimization problems~(EMOPs) under varying operational conditions. This gives rise to parametric expensive multi-objective optimization problems (P-EMOPs) where each task parameter defines a distinct optimization instance. Current multi-objective Bayesian optimization methods have been widely used for finding finite sets of Pareto optimal solutions for individual tasks. However, P-EMOPs present a fundamental challenge: the continuous task parameter space can contain infinite distinct problems, each requiring separate expensive evaluations. This demands learning an inverse model that can directly predict optimized solutions for any task-preference query without expensive re-evaluation. This paper introduces the first parametric multi-objective Bayesian optimizer that learns this inverse model by alternating between (1) acquisition-driven search leveraging inter-task synergies and (2) generative solution sampling via conditional generative models. This approach enables efficient optimization across related tasks and finally achieves direct solution prediction for unseen parameterized EMOPs without additional expensive evaluations. We theoretically justify the faster convergence by leveraging inter-task synergies through task-aware Gaussian processes. Meanwhile, empirical studies in synthetic and real-world benchmarks further verify the effectiveness of our alternating framework.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeuroLingua is a language-inspired framework for automated sleep stage classification that treats sleep as a structured physiological language, using CNN-based tokenization and dual-level Transformers for hierarchical temporal modeling with multimodal EEG/EOG fusion via Graph Convolutional Networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated sleep stage classification faces limitations in temporal hierarchy modeling, multimodal EEG/EOG fusion challenges, and lack of interpretability in deep learning models.

Method: Decomposes 30-second epochs into 3-second subwindows (tokens) using CNN tokenizer, employs dual-level Transformers for intra-segment and inter-segment modeling across 7 epochs, and fuses EEG/EOG modalities via Graph Convolutional Network.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results on Sleep-EDF (85.3% accuracy, 0.800 macro F1, 0.796 Cohen's kappa) and competitive performance on ISRUC (81.9% accuracy, 0.802 macro F1, 0.755 kappa), matching or exceeding published baselines.

Conclusion: NeuroLingua provides a principled foundation for interpretable sleep analysis by framing sleep as a compositional language, unifying hierarchical sequence modeling and multimodal fusion for more transparent clinical applications.

Abstract: Automated sleep stage classification from polysomnography remains limited by the lack of expressive temporal hierarchies, challenges in multimodal EEG and EOG fusion, and the limited interpretability of deep learning models. We propose NeuroLingua, a language-inspired framework that conceptualizes sleep as a structured physiological language. Each 30-second epoch is decomposed into overlapping 3-second subwindows ("tokens") using a CNN-based tokenizer, enabling hierarchical temporal modeling through dual-level Transformers: intra-segment encoding of local dependencies and inter-segment integration across seven consecutive epochs (3.5 minutes) for extended context. Modality-specific embeddings from EEG and EOG channels are fused via a Graph Convolutional Network, facilitating robust multimodal integration. NeuroLingua is evaluated on the Sleep-EDF Expanded and ISRUC-Sleep datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on Sleep-EDF (85.3% accuracy, 0.800 macro F1, and 0.796 Cohen's kappa) and competitive performance on ISRUC (81.9% accuracy, 0.802 macro F1, and 0.755 kappa), matching or exceeding published baselines in overall and per-class metrics. The architecture's attention mechanisms enhance the detection of clinically relevant sleep microevents, providing a principled foundation for future interpretability, explainability, and causal inference in sleep research. By framing sleep as a compositional language, NeuroLingua unifies hierarchical sequence modeling and multimodal fusion, advancing automated sleep staging toward more transparent and clinically meaningful applications.

TL;DR: UCB-QRL is an optimistic RL algorithm for optimizing quantile objectives in finite-horizon MDPs, providing risk-sensitive learning with theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical RL doesn't account for risk sensitivity needed in fields like healthcare and finance, where optimizing quantiles of reward distributions is important.

Method: UCB-QRL iteratively estimates transition probabilities and optimizes quantile value functions over confidence balls around these estimates.

Result: The algorithm achieves a high-probability regret bound of O((2/κ)^{H+1}H√(SATH log(2SATH/δ))) with problem-dependent constant κ.

Conclusion: UCB-QRL provides a theoretically sound approach for risk-sensitive RL with quantile objectives in finite-horizon MDPs.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved tremendous success in recent years. However, the classical foundations of RL do not account for the risk sensitivity of the objective function, which is critical in various fields, including healthcare and finance. A popular approach to incorporate risk sensitivity is to optimize a specific quantile of the cumulative reward distribution. In this paper, we develop UCB-QRL, an optimistic learning algorithm for the $τ$-quantile objective in finite-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs). UCB-QRL is an iterative algorithm in which, at each iteration, we first estimate the underlying transition probability and then optimize the quantile value function over a confidence ball around this estimate. We show that UCB-QRL yields a high-probability regret bound $\mathcal O\left((2/κ)^{H+1}H\sqrt{SATH\log(2SATH/δ)}\right)$ in the episodic setting with $S$ states, $A$ actions, $T$ episodes, and $H$ horizons. Here, $κ>0$ is a problem-dependent constant that captures the sensitivity of the underlying MDP's quantile value.

### [172] [Generalization Can Emerge in Tabular Foundation Models From a Single Table](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09665)
*Junwei Ma,Nour Shaheen,Alex Labach,Amine Mhedhbi,Frank Hutter,Anthony L. Caterini,Valentin Thomas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper challenges the need for large synthetic or real datasets for tabular foundation models, showing that simple self-supervised pre-training on just one real table can achieve strong cross-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the prevailing view that broad generalization in tabular deep learning requires pre-training on large synthetic corpora or extensive real datasets, and to discover that minimal data suffices for effective generalization.

Method: Systematic pre-training and evaluation on diverse datasets using simple self-supervised pre-training on single real tables, analyzing data aspects important for building tabular foundation models.

Result: A relatively small amount of data suffices for generalization, with self-supervised pre-training on just one real table producing surprisingly strong transfer across heterogeneous benchmarks.

Conclusion: The number and quality of tasks constructible from a dataset are key to downstream performance in tabular foundation models, rather than requiring massive pre-training datasets.

Abstract: Deep tabular modelling increasingly relies on in-context learning where, during inference, a model receives a set of $(x,y)$ pairs as context and predicts labels for new inputs without weight updates. We challenge the prevailing view that broad generalization here requires pre-training on large synthetic corpora (e.g., TabPFN priors) or a large collection of real data (e.g., TabDPT training datasets), discovering that a relatively small amount of data suffices for generalization. We find that simple self-supervised pre-training on just a \emph{single} real table can produce surprisingly strong transfer across heterogeneous benchmarks. By systematically pre-training and evaluating on many diverse datasets, we analyze what aspects of the data are most important for building a Tabular Foundation Model (TFM) generalizing across domains. We then connect this to the pre-training procedure shared by most TFMs and show that the number and quality of \emph{tasks} one can construct from a dataset is key to downstream performance.

*Samuel Maddock,Shripad Gade,Graham Cormode,Will Bullock*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GEM+ combines AIM's adaptive measurement framework with GEM's scalable generator network to create differentially private synthetic tabular data that outperforms AIM in utility and scalability, especially for high-dimensional datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods like AIM face scalability issues with high-dimensional data due to graphical models requiring substantial memory and computational overhead when graph structures change. Recent methods like GEM improve scalability but lack comprehensive evaluation on larger datasets.

Method: Integrates AIM's adaptive 'select-measure-generate' framework with GEM's scalable generator neural network, creating GEM+ that combines systematic optimization under privacy constraints with improved computational efficiency.

Result: GEM+ outperforms AIM in both utility and scalability, achieving state-of-the-art results while efficiently handling datasets with over a hundred columns where AIM fails due to memory and computational limitations.

Conclusion: GEM+ successfully addresses the scalability limitations of previous methods by combining adaptive measurement with neural network generators, enabling practical application to high-dimensional real-world datasets while maintaining data quality under privacy constraints.

Abstract: State-of-the-art differentially private synthetic tabular data has been defined by adaptive 'select-measure-generate' frameworks, exemplified by methods like AIM. These approaches iteratively measure low-order noisy marginals and fit graphical models to produce synthetic data, enabling systematic optimisation of data quality under privacy constraints. Graphical models, however, are inefficient for high-dimensional data because they require substantial memory and must be retrained from scratch whenever the graph structure changes, leading to significant computational overhead. Recent methods, like GEM, overcome these limitations by using generator neural networks for improved scalability. However, empirical comparisons have mostly focused on small datasets, limiting real-world applicability. In this work, we introduce GEM+, which integrates AIM's adaptive measurement framework with GEM's scalable generator network. Our experiments show that GEM+ outperforms AIM in both utility and scalability, delivering state-of-the-art results while efficiently handling datasets with over a hundred columns, where AIM fails due to memory and computational overheads.

*Pedro Dall'Antonia,Tiago da Silva,Daniel Augusto de Souza,César Lincoln C. Mattos,Diego Mesquita*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Boosted GFlowNets use sequential ensemble training with residual rewards to improve exploration and sample diversity in multimodal tasks, overcoming the exploration imbalance of standard GFlowNets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard GFlowNets struggle with uneven exploration where easy-to-reach regions dominate training while hard-to-reach modes receive poor gradients, leading to inadequate coverage of high-reward areas.

Method: Sequentially train an ensemble of GFlowNets where each model optimizes a residual reward that compensates for mass already captured by previous models, reactivating learning signals in underexplored regions.

Result: Achieve substantially better exploration and sample diversity on multimodal synthetic benchmarks and peptide design tasks while maintaining training stability and simplicity.

Conclusion: Boosted GFlowNets provide monotone non-degradation guarantees and significantly improve exploration capabilities without compromising the stability of standard GFlowNet training.

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are powerful samplers for compositional objects that, by design, sample proportionally to a given non-negative reward. Nonetheless, in practice, they often struggle to explore the reward landscape evenly: trajectories toward easy-to-reach regions dominate training, while hard-to-reach modes receive vanishing or uninformative gradients, leading to poor coverage of high-reward areas. We address this imbalance with Boosted GFlowNets, a method that sequentially trains an ensemble of GFlowNets, each optimizing a residual reward that compensates for the mass already captured by previous models. This residual principle reactivates learning signals in underexplored regions and, under mild assumptions, ensures a monotone non-degradation property: adding boosters cannot worsen the learned distribution and typically improves it. Empirically, Boosted GFlowNets achieve substantially better exploration and sample diversity on multimodal synthetic benchmarks and peptide design tasks, while preserving the stability and simplicity of standard trajectory-balance training.

*Tairan Huang,Yulin Jin,Junxu Liu,Qingqing Ye,Haibo Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SEBA is a sample-efficient black-box adversarial attack framework for visual RL agents that uses a shadow Q model, GAN-based perturbations, and world modeling to reduce environment queries while maintaining attack effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual RL's vulnerability to adversarial attacks is underexplored, especially for continuous control tasks with large action spaces where existing black-box attacks are inefficient due to excessive environment queries.

Method: Integrates shadow Q model for reward estimation under attacks, GAN for imperceptible perturbations, and world model to simulate dynamics. Uses two-stage iterative training alternating between shadow model learning and generator refinement.

Result: Significantly reduces cumulative rewards, preserves visual fidelity, and greatly decreases environment interactions compared to prior black-box and white-box methods on MuJoCo and Atari benchmarks.

Conclusion: SEBA provides an efficient and effective black-box adversarial attack framework for visual RL that addresses the limitations of existing methods in continuous control settings.

Abstract: Visual reinforcement learning has achieved remarkable progress in visual control and robotics, but its vulnerability to adversarial perturbations remains underexplored. Most existing black-box attacks focus on vector-based or discrete-action RL, and their effectiveness on image-based continuous control is limited by the large action space and excessive environment queries. We propose SEBA, a sample-efficient framework for black-box adversarial attacks on visual RL agents. SEBA integrates a shadow Q model that estimates cumulative rewards under adversarial conditions, a generative adversarial network that produces visually imperceptible perturbations, and a world model that simulates environment dynamics to reduce real-world queries. Through a two-stage iterative training procedure that alternates between learning the shadow model and refining the generator, SEBA achieves strong attack performance while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on MuJoCo and Atari benchmarks show that SEBA significantly reduces cumulative rewards, preserves visual fidelity, and greatly decreases environment interactions compared to prior black-box and white-box methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A constrained RL framework for Text2SQL that addresses reward hacking by incorporating interpretable reward and constraint signals with dynamic balancing during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods for Text2SQL are sensitive to reward function design and vulnerable to reward hacking, where models exploit reward loopholes without genuinely solving tasks.

Method: Proposes a constrained RL framework with natural and interpretable reward/constraint signals, dynamically balancing trade-offs among them during training.

Result: Theoretical guarantees established and numerical experiments on Text2SQL datasets show improvement over state-of-the-art RL-trained LLMs.

Conclusion: The constrained RL approach effectively mitigates reward hacking and enhances Text2SQL performance compared to existing RL methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated significant promise in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Text2SQL LLMs, especially with advanced algorithms such as GRPO and DAPO. However, the performance of these methods is highly sensitive to the design of reward functions. Inappropriate rewards can lead to reward hacking, where models exploit loopholes in the reward structure to achieve high scores without genuinely solving the task. This work considers a constrained RL framework for Text2SQL that incorporates natural and interpretable reward and constraint signals, while dynamically balancing trade-offs among them during the training. We establish the theoretical guarantees of our constrained RL framework and our numerical experiments on the well-known Text2SQL datasets substantiate the improvement of our approach over the state-of-the-art RL-trained LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MCR (modular composite representation) achieves superior balance of capacity, accuracy, and hardware efficiency compared to binary/integer vectors, approaching complex-valued performance with much lower memory footprint and enabling significant speed/energy improvements through dedicated hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCR has received limited attention despite its potential as a high-dimensional integer vector representation with higher representational power than binary spatter codes and lighter than high-precision models. Systematic analyses of its trade-offs were lacking.

Method: Conducted first extensive evaluation of MCR including capacity measurements, accuracy evaluation on 123 datasets, and hardware realization through dedicated accelerator design mapping naturally to digital logic.

Result: MCR outperforms binary/integer vectors in capacity, approaches complex-valued representations with much lower memory, achieves 4x memory reduction vs binary spatter codes at same performance, and shows 3 orders of magnitude speedup and significant energy reductions with hardware acceleration.

Conclusion: MCR's modular arithmetic and higher per-component precision enable lower dimensionality, resulting in faster, more energy-efficient, and high-precision alternative to existing models when realized with dedicated hardware.

Abstract: The modular composite representation (MCR) is a computing model that represents information with high-dimensional integer vectors using modular arithmetic. Originally proposed as a generalization of the binary spatter code model, it aims to provide higher representational power while remaining a lighter alternative to models requiring high-precision components. Despite this potential, MCR has received limited attention. Systematic analyses of its trade-offs and comparisons with other models are lacking, sustaining the perception that its added complexity outweighs the improved expressivity. In this work, we revisit MCR by presenting its first extensive evaluation, demonstrating that it achieves a unique balance of capacity, accuracy, and hardware efficiency. Experiments measuring capacity demonstrate that MCR outperforms binary and integer vectors while approaching complex-valued representations at a fraction of their memory footprint. Evaluation on 123 datasets confirms consistent accuracy gains and shows that MCR can match the performance of binary spatter codes using up to 4x less memory. We investigate the hardware realization of MCR by showing that it maps naturally to digital logic and by designing the first dedicated accelerator. Evaluations on basic operations and 7 selected datasets demonstrate a speedup of up to 3 orders of magnitude and significant energy reductions compared to software implementation. When matched for accuracy against binary spatter codes, MCR achieves on average 3.08x faster execution and 2.68x lower energy consumption. These findings demonstrate that, although MCR requires more sophisticated operations than binary spatter codes, its modular arithmetic and higher per-component precision enable lower dimensionality. When realized with dedicated hardware, this results in a faster, more energy-efficient, and high-precision alternative to existing models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PDE solving is computationally expensive, and existing deep learning surrogates typically specialize in single PDEs with fixed parameters, lacking generalization capability.

Method: Condition neural models on vector encodings representing PDE terms and coefficients, trained on a family of 1D PDEs from APEBench suite using four distinct modeling techniques.

Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) can be prohibitively expensive using traditional numerical methods. Deep learning-based surrogate models typically specialize in a single PDE with fixed parameters.

### [179] [FlowCast: Advancing Precipitation Nowcasting with Conditional Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09731)
*Bernardo Perrone Ribeiro,Jana Faganeli Pucer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlowCast applies Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) to radar precipitation nowcasting, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with much faster sampling than diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radar-based precipitation nowcasting is critical for flood risk management, but existing deep learning approaches face challenges with atmospheric uncertainty and high-dimensional data modeling. Diffusion models show promise but are computationally prohibitive for time-critical applications due to their iterative sampling process.

Method: FlowCast uses Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) instead of diffusion models. CFM learns a direct noise-to-data mapping, enabling rapid sample generation with drastically fewer function evaluations compared to iterative diffusion sampling.

Result: FlowCast establishes new state-of-the-art in predictive accuracy for precipitation nowcasting. CFM objective is both more accurate and significantly more efficient than diffusion objective on the same architecture, maintaining high performance with significantly fewer sampling steps.

Conclusion: CFM is positioned as a powerful and practical alternative to diffusion models for high-dimensional spatiotemporal forecasting, offering both superior accuracy and computational efficiency for time-critical applications like precipitation nowcasting.

Abstract: Radar-based precipitation nowcasting, the task of forecasting short-term precipitation fields from previous radar images, is a critical problem for flood risk management and decision-making. While deep learning has substantially advanced this field, two challenges remain fundamental: the uncertainty of atmospheric dynamics and the efficient modeling of high-dimensional data. Diffusion models have shown strong promise by producing sharp, reliable forecasts, but their iterative sampling process is computationally prohibitive for time-critical applications. We introduce FlowCast, the first model to apply Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) to precipitation nowcasting. Unlike diffusion, CFM learns a direct noise-to-data mapping, enabling rapid, high-fidelity sample generation with drastically fewer function evaluations. Our experiments demonstrate that FlowCast establishes a new state-of-the-art in predictive accuracy. A direct comparison further reveals the CFM objective is both more accurate and significantly more efficient than a diffusion objective on the same architecture, maintaining high performance with significantly fewer sampling steps. This work positions CFM as a powerful and practical alternative for high-dimensional spatiotemporal forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies catastrophic forgetting in Split Federated Learning (SFL) with heterogeneous data, identifies the problem of sequential processing bias at the server, and proposes Hydra - a multi-head inspired mitigation method that outperforms existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address catastrophic forgetting in SFL where local model updates drift from global optima and server-side sequential processing causes bias toward classes seen later in the sequence, similar to continual learning forgetting.

Method: Proposed Hydra method inspired by multi-head neural networks, adapted for SFL setting to mitigate sequential processing bias and catastrophic forgetting.

Result: Extensive evaluations show Hydra outperforms baseline methods and existing approaches from literature in handling catastrophic forgetting in SFL.

Conclusion: Hydra effectively addresses catastrophic forgetting in SFL by mitigating sequential processing bias through multi-head inspired architecture, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: In Split Federated Learning (SFL), the clients collaboratively train a model with the help of a server by splitting the model into two parts. Part-1 is trained locally at each client and aggregated by the aggregator at the end of each round. Part-2 is trained at a server that sequentially processes the intermediate activations received from each client. We study the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting (CF) in SFL in the presence of data heterogeneity. In detail, due to the nature of SFL, local updates of part-1 may drift away from global optima, while part-2 is sensitive to the processing sequence, similar to forgetting in continual learning (CL). Specifically, we observe that the trained model performs better in classes (labels) seen at the end of the sequence. We investigate this phenomenon with emphasis on key aspects of SFL, such as the processing order at the server and the cut layer. Based on our findings, we propose Hydra, a novel mitigation method inspired by multi-head neural networks and adapted for the SFL's setting. Extensive numerical evaluations show that Hydra outperforms baselines and methods from the literature.

TL;DR: SPARC introduces single-phase adaptation for robust control in contextual RL, achieving reliable OOD generalization without explicit context information at test time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of generalization to unseen environments in robotics and control, particularly for agents operating in varying contexts like self-driving cars or quadrupedal robots in different terrains or weather conditions.

Method: Simplifies previous two-phase approaches by introducing single-phase adaptation (SPARC) that trains context encoder and history adaptation module together, eliminating the need for separate training stages.

Result: SPARC achieves reliable and robust out-of-distribution generalization when tested on varying contexts in Gran Turismo 7 racing simulator and wind-perturbed MuJoCo environments.

Conclusion: Single-phase adaptation provides a simpler yet effective approach for robust control in contextual reinforcement learning, enabling reliable generalization to unseen environments without explicit context information.

Abstract: Generalization to unseen environments is a significant challenge in the field of robotics and control. In this work, we focus on contextual reinforcement learning, where agents act within environments with varying contexts, such as self-driving cars or quadrupedal robots that need to operate in different terrains or weather conditions than they were trained for. We tackle the critical task of generalizing to out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, without access to explicit context information at test time. Recent work has addressed this problem by training a context encoder and a history adaptation module in separate stages. While promising, this two-phase approach is cumbersome to implement and train. We simplify the methodology and introduce SPARC: single-phase adaptation for robust control. We test SPARC on varying contexts within the high-fidelity racing simulator Gran Turismo 7 and wind-perturbed MuJoCo environments, and find that it achieves reliable and robust OOD generalization.

*Houming Wu,Ling Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TawPipe is a topology-aware weight pipeline parallelism method that optimizes communication in distributed LLM training by leveraging hierarchical bandwidth and reducing cross-node traffic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pipeline parallelism suffers from activation communication overhead scaling with sequence length, while weight-passing approaches have redundant P2P transfers and underutilized intra-node bandwidth.

Method: Groups devices based on topology to optimize intra-node collective and inter-node P2P communication; assigns fixed shard of model weights and gradients to avoid redundant transfers; overlaps communication with computation.

Result: Extensive experiments on up to 24 GPUs with LLaMA-style models show superior throughput and scalability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: TawPipe effectively reduces cross-node communication traffic and achieves better performance than existing pipeline parallelism methods for large language model training.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally constrained by limited device memory and costly inter-device communication. Although pipeline parallelism alleviates memory pressure by partitioning models across devices, it incurs activation communication overhead that scales linearly with sequence length, limiting efficiency in long-context training. Recent weight-passing approaches (e.g., WeiPipe) mitigate this by transmitting model weights instead of activations, but suffer from redundant peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers and underutilized intra-node bandwidth. We propose TawPipe--topology-aware weight pipeline parallelism, which exploits hierarchical bandwidth in distributed clusters for improved communication efficiency. TawPipe: (i) groups devices based on topology to optimize intra-node collective and inter-node P2P communication; (ii) assigns each device a fixed shard of model weights and gradients, avoiding redundant transfers; and (iii) overlaps communication with computation to hide latency. Unlike global collective operations used in fully sharded data parallelism (FSDP), TawPipe confines most communication within node boundaries, significantly reducing cross-node traffic. Extensive experiments on up to 24 GPUs with LLaMA-style models show that TawPipe achieves superior throughput and scalability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

*Sarthak Khanna,Armin Berger,Muskaan Chopra,Rafet Sifa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A retrieval-augmented forecasting framework that uses macroeconomic context to improve financial market predictions under regime shifts, achieving robust out-of-distribution performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial markets are non-stationary with structural breaks, causing conventional forecasting models to fail out-of-distribution. Existing multimodal approaches don't adapt well to macroeconomic regime shifts.

Method: Macro-contextual retrieval framework that jointly embeds macro indicators and financial news sentiment, enabling retrieval of historically analogous macroeconomic regimes for each prediction without retraining.

Result: Achieved positive out-of-sample trading outcomes (AAPL: PF=1.18, Sharpe=0.95; XOM: PF=1.16, Sharpe=0.61) while baselines collapsed under regime shifts. Narrowed CV to OOD performance gap and provided interpretable evidence chains.

Conclusion: Macro-aware retrieval yields robust, explainable forecasts under distributional change by operationalizing the principle that financial history often rhymes, enabling adaptation to regime shifts without retraining.

Abstract: Financial markets are inherently non-stationary: structural breaks and macroeconomic regime shifts often cause forecasting models to fail when deployed out of distribution (OOD). Conventional multimodal approaches that simply fuse numerical indicators and textual sentiment rarely adapt to such shifts. We introduce macro-contextual retrieval, a retrieval-augmented forecasting framework that grounds each prediction in historically analogous macroeconomic regimes. The method jointly embeds macro indicators (e.g., CPI, unemployment, yield spread, GDP growth) and financial news sentiment in a shared similarity space, enabling causal retrieval of precedent periods during inference without retraining.
  Trained on seventeen years of S&P 500 data (2007-2023) and evaluated OOD on AAPL (2024) and XOM (2024), the framework consistently narrows the CV to OOD performance gap. Macro-conditioned retrieval achieves the only positive out-of-sample trading outcomes (AAPL: PF=1.18, Sharpe=0.95; XOM: PF=1.16, Sharpe=0.61), while static numeric, text-only, and naive multimodal baselines collapse under regime shifts. Beyond metric gains, retrieved neighbors form interpretable evidence chains that correspond to recognizable macro contexts, such as inflationary or yield-curve inversion phases, supporting causal interpretability and transparency. By operationalizing the principle that "financial history may not repeat, but it often rhymes," this work demonstrates that macro-aware retrieval yields robust, explainable forecasts under distributional change.
  All datasets, models, and source code are publicly available.

*Guy Blanc,Yizhi Huang,Tal Malkin,Rocco A. Servedio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes computational learning algorithms under two adversarial noise models (malicious and nasty noise) in both distribution-independent and fixed-distribution settings, revealing strong equivalence in the former but arbitrarily large separation in the latter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the relative capabilities and limitations of efficient learning algorithms when faced with different types of adversarial noise, particularly comparing malicious noise (random corruption) versus nasty noise (adversarially chosen corruption).

Method: Theoretical analysis using computational complexity and cryptographic assumptions to prove relationships between the two noise models across different learning settings, including defining and analyzing ICE (ignore contradictory examples) algorithms.

Result: Distribution-independent learning shows strong equivalence between malicious and nasty noise, while fixed-distribution learning exhibits arbitrarily large separation. ICE algorithms bridge this gap with a factor-of-two equivalence.

Conclusion: The relationship between malicious and nasty noise depends crucially on the learning setting, with fundamental differences between distribution-independent and fixed-distribution scenarios, though ICE algorithms provide a natural bridge between the two noise models.

Abstract: We consider the relative abilities and limitations of computationally efficient algorithms for learning in the presence of noise, under two well-studied and challenging adversarial noise models for learning Boolean functions: malicious noise, in which an adversary can arbitrarily corrupt a random subset of examples given to the learner; and nasty noise, in which an adversary can arbitrarily corrupt an adversarially chosen subset of examples given to the learner.
  We consider both the distribution-independent and fixed-distribution settings. Our main results highlight a dramatic difference between these two settings: For distribution-independent learning, we prove a strong equivalence between the two noise models: If a class ${\cal C}$ of functions is efficiently learnable in the presence of $η$-rate malicious noise, then it is also efficiently learnable in the presence of $η$-rate nasty noise. In sharp contrast, for the fixed-distribution setting we show an arbitrarily large separation: Under a standard cryptographic assumption, for any arbitrarily large value $r$ there exists a concept class for which there is a ratio of $r$ between the rate $η_{malicious}$ of malicious noise that polynomial-time learning algorithms can tolerate, versus the rate $η_{nasty}$ of nasty noise that such learning algorithms can tolerate.
  To offset the negative result for the fixed-distribution setting, we define a broad and natural class of algorithms, namely those that ignore contradictory examples (ICE). We show that for these algorithms, malicious noise and nasty noise are equivalent up to a factor of two in the noise rate: Any efficient ICE learner that succeeds with $η$-rate malicious noise can be converted to an efficient learner that succeeds with $η/2$-rate nasty noise. We further show that the above factor of two is necessary, again under a standard cryptographic assumption.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate vulnerabilities in decentralized Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for LLM post-training where malicious nodes can poison the system through token injection attacks.

Method: Present adversarial attacks in decentralized GRPO using both out-of-context and in-context attacks where malicious tokens are injected, demonstrated through math and coding tasks.

Result: Adversarial attacks achieve up to 100% success rates in poisoning benign nodes within 50 iterations, effectively polluting local LLM post-training.

Conclusion: Proposed defenses depending on whether users train same or different models can achieve up to 100% stop rates, making the attacks impossible.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has demonstrated great utilization in post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs). In GRPO, prompts are answered by the model and, through reinforcement learning, preferred completions are learnt. Owing to the small communication volume, GRPO is inherently suitable for decentralised training as the prompts can be concurrently answered by multiple nodes and then exchanged in the forms of strings. In this work, we present the first adversarial attack in decentralised GRPO. We demonstrate that malicious parties can poison such systems by injecting arbitrary malicious tokens in benign models in both out-of-context and in-context attacks. Using empirical examples of math and coding tasks, we show that adversarial attacks can easily poison the benign nodes, polluting their local LLM post-training, achieving attack success rates up to 100% in as few as 50 iterations. We propose two ways to defend against these attacks, depending on whether all users train the same model or different models. We show that these defenses can achieve stop rates of up to 100%, making the attack impossible.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: JEPAs cluster time-series data by learning the invariant subspace of the system's Koopman operator, with the linear predictor's near-identity constraint being key to learning regime indicator functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain why Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) can cluster time-series data by dynamical regimes, which was previously unexplained.

Method: Theoretical analysis proving JEPA loss is minimized when encoder learns Koopman eigenfunctions, validated on synthetic data with known dynamics, focusing on the near-identity linear predictor constraint.

Result: Constraining JEPA's linear predictor to be near-identity forces the encoder to learn regime indicator functions (Koopman eigenfunctions), enabling clustering by dynamical regimes.

Conclusion: The near-identity predictor constraint is crucial for learning interpretable representations and disentangling regimes, connecting self-supervised learning with dynamical systems theory.

Abstract: Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs), a powerful class of self-supervised models, exhibit an unexplained ability to cluster time-series data by their underlying dynamical regimes. We propose a novel theoretical explanation for this phenomenon, hypothesizing that JEPA's predictive objective implicitly drives it to learn the invariant subspace of the system's Koopman operator. We prove that an idealized JEPA loss is minimized when the encoder represents the system's regime indicator functions, which are Koopman eigenfunctions. This theory was validated on synthetic data with known dynamics, demonstrating that constraining the JEPA's linear predictor to be a near-identity operator is the key inductive bias that forces the encoder to learn these invariants. We further discuss that this constraint is critical for selecting this interpretable solution from a class of mathematically equivalent but entangled optima, revealing the predictor's role in representation disentanglement. This work demystifies a key behavior of JEPAs, provides a principled connection between modern self-supervised learning and dynamical systems theory, and informs the design of more robust and interpretable time-series models.

*Fulong Yao,Wanqing Zhao,Chao Zheng,Xiaofei Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CaReTS is a multi-task learning framework for time series forecasting that combines classification and regression tasks using a dual-stream architecture to provide both accurate predictions and interpretable insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most deep forecasting models struggle to provide both accurate predictions and interpretable insights into temporal dynamics, creating a need for frameworks that can deliver both forecasting accuracy and trend interpretability.

Method: Uses a dual-stream architecture with classification branch for stepwise trend learning and regression branch for deviation estimation from latest observations. Implements multi-task loss with uncertainty-aware weighting and four variants incorporating CNN, LSTM, and Transformer encoders.

Result: CaReTS outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in forecasting accuracy while achieving higher trend classification performance on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully provides both accurate predictions and interpretable insights by disentangling macro-level trends from micro-level deviations through multi-task learning.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep forecasting models have achieved remarkable performance, yet most approaches still struggle to provide both accurate predictions and interpretable insights into temporal dynamics. This paper proposes CaReTS, a novel multi-task learning framework that combines classification and regression tasks for multi-step time series forecasting problems. The framework adopts a dual-stream architecture, where a classification branch learns the stepwise trend into the future, while a regression branch estimates the corresponding deviations from the latest observation of the target variable. The dual-stream design provides more interpretable predictions by disentangling macro-level trends from micro-level deviations in the target variable. To enable effective learning in output prediction, deviation estimation, and trend classification, we design a multi-task loss with uncertainty-aware weighting to adaptively balance the contribution of each task. Furthermore, four variants (CaReTS1--4) are instantiated under this framework to incorporate mainstream temporal modelling encoders, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), and Transformers. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that CaReTS outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms in forecasting accuracy, while achieving higher trend classification performance.

*Tianmeng Hu,Yongzheng Cui,Rui Tang,Biao Luo,Ke Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Non-monotonic value decomposition in MARL can achieve IGM consistency without explicit constraints, as unstable equilibria naturally vanish during learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing value decomposition methods either limit expressive power with monotonicity constraints or add complexity with soft surrogates to ensure IGM consistency.

Method: Dynamical systems analysis modeling learning as continuous-time gradient flow, proving unstable equilibria for IGM-violating solutions under greedy exploration.

Result: Unconstrained non-monotonic factorization reliably recovers IGM-optimal solutions and outperforms monotonic baselines in experiments on matrix games and MARL benchmarks.

Conclusion: Non-monotonic value decomposition without constraints can achieve IGM consistency, with insights on TD targets and exploration for future MARL algorithm design.

Abstract: Value decomposition is a central approach in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), enabling centralized training with decentralized execution by factorizing the global value function into local values. To ensure individual-global-max (IGM) consistency, existing methods either enforce monotonicity constraints, which limit expressive power, or adopt softer surrogates at the cost of algorithmic complexity. In this work, we present a dynamical systems analysis of non-monotonic value decomposition, modeling learning dynamics as continuous-time gradient flow. We prove that, under approximately greedy exploration, all zero-loss equilibria violating IGM consistency are unstable saddle points, while only IGM-consistent solutions are stable attractors of the learning dynamics. Extensive experiments on both synthetic matrix games and challenging MARL benchmarks demonstrate that unconstrained, non-monotonic factorization reliably recovers IGM-optimal solutions and consistently outperforms monotonic baselines. Additionally, we investigate the influence of temporal-difference targets and exploration strategies, providing actionable insights for the design of future value-based MARL algorithms.

### [189] [Constrained Best Arm Identification with Tests for Feasibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09808)
*Ting Cai,Kirthevasan Kandasamy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Best Arm Identification (BAI) algorithm that handles feasibility constraints where performance and feasibility can be tested separately, with applications like drug discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing BAI methods assume simultaneous observation of performance and constraints, but real-world scenarios like drug discovery require separate testing of potency vs safety constraints (toxicity, solubility).

Method: Proposed a BAI algorithm that selects tuples (arm, test type) - either performance test (ℓ=0) or one of N feasibility constraints (ℓ∈[N]), using adaptive sampling to eliminate arms based on worse performance or infeasibility.

Result: The algorithm achieves asymptotic optimality (δ→0) with upper-bounded sample complexity, and empirically outperforms state-of-the-art BAI methods on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed feasible BAI framework effectively handles separate performance and constraint testing, providing an efficient and optimal solution for practical applications requiring both performance optimization and feasibility guarantees.

Abstract: Best arm identification (BAI) aims to identify the highest-performance arm among a set of $K$ arms by collecting stochastic samples from each arm. In real-world problems, the best arm needs to satisfy additional feasibility constraints. While there is limited prior work on BAI with feasibility constraints, they typically assume the performance and constraints are observed simultaneously on each pull of an arm. However, this assumption does not reflect most practical use cases, e.g., in drug discovery, we wish to find the most potent drug whose toxicity and solubility are below certain safety thresholds. These safety experiments can be conducted separately from the potency measurement. Thus, this requires designing BAI algorithms that not only decide which arm to pull but also decide whether to test for the arm's performance or feasibility. In this work, we study feasible BAI which allows a decision-maker to choose a tuple $(i,\ell)$, where $i\in [K]$ denotes an arm and $\ell$ denotes whether she wishes to test for its performance ($\ell=0$) or any of its $N$ feasibility constraints ($\ell\in[N]$). We focus on the fixed confidence setting, which is to identify the \textit{feasible} arm with the \textit{highest performance}, with a probability of at least $1-δ$. We propose an efficient algorithm and upper-bound its sample complexity, showing our algorithm can naturally adapt to the problem's difficulty and eliminate arms by worse performance or infeasibility, whichever is easier. We complement this upper bound with a lower bound showing that our algorithm is \textit{asymptotically ($δ\rightarrow 0$) optimal}. Finally, we empirically show that our algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art BAI algorithms in both synthetic and real-world datasets.

*Arthur Castello Branco de Oliveira,Dhruv Jatkar,Eduardo Sontag*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Analysis of how neural network compositional structure affects optimization landscape and training dynamics, showing universal convergence properties for overparameterized networks with linear activations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the compositional structure of neural networks shapes their optimization behavior and training dynamics, particularly in overparameterized settings.

Method: Analyze gradient flow for overparameterized optimization problems (neural networks with linear activations), characterize landscape geometry for scalar-valued cost functions, and extend insights to sigmoidal activations.

Result: Global convergence properties hold for any proper real analytic cost function; saddle point locations and stability are universal across costs; convergence can be arbitrarily accelerated based on initialization imbalance.

Conclusion: Key structural features of optimization landscapes are universal across cost functions in overparameterized networks, and these insights extend beyond linear activations to more complex architectures.

Abstract: This paper investigates how the compositional structure of neural networks shapes their optimization landscape and training dynamics. We analyze the gradient flow associated with overparameterized optimization problems, which can be interpreted as training a neural network with linear activations. Remarkably, we show that the global convergence properties can be derived for any cost function that is proper and real analytic. We then specialize the analysis to scalar-valued cost functions, where the geometry of the landscape can be fully characterized. In this setting, we demonstrate that key structural features -- such as the location and stability of saddle points -- are universal across all admissible costs, depending solely on the overparameterized representation rather than on problem-specific details. Moreover, we show that convergence can be arbitrarily accelerated depending on the initialization, as measured by an imbalance metric introduced in this work. Finally, we discuss how these insights may generalize to neural networks with sigmoidal activations, showing through a simple example which geometric and dynamical properties persist beyond the linear case.

TL;DR: SMoFi is a Split Federated Learning framework that addresses data heterogeneity by synchronizing momentum buffers and using staleness-aware alignment to control gradient divergence, improving accuracy and convergence speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data heterogeneity across silos in Split Federated Learning presents major challenges that undermine convergence speed and accuracy of the global model.

Method: Step-wise Momentum Fusion (SMoFi) synchronizes momentum buffers across server-side optimizers and uses staleness-aware alignment mechanism to impose constraints on gradient updates of server-side submodel.

Result: Extensive validations show SMoFi improves global model accuracy up to 7.1% and convergence speed up to 10.25x, with greater impact when more clients and deeper models are involved.

Conclusion: SMoFi is particularly suitable for model training in resource-constrained contexts due to its effectiveness with more clients and deeper learning models.

Abstract: Split Federated Learning is a system-efficient federated learning paradigm that leverages the rich computing resources at a central server to train model partitions. Data heterogeneity across silos, however, presents a major challenge undermining the convergence speed and accuracy of the global model. This paper introduces Step-wise Momentum Fusion (SMoFi), an effective and lightweight framework that counteracts gradient divergence arising from data heterogeneity by synchronizing the momentum buffers across server-side optimizers. To control gradient divergence over the training process, we design a staleness-aware alignment mechanism that imposes constraints on gradient updates of the server-side submodel at each optimization step. Extensive validations on multiple real-world datasets show that SMoFi consistently improves global model accuracy (up to 7.1%) and convergence speed (up to 10.25$\times$). Furthermore, SMoFi has a greater impact with more clients involved and deeper learning models, making it particularly suitable for model training in resource-constrained contexts.

*Ilias Diakonikolas,Mingchen Ma,Lisheng Ren,Christos Tzamos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel algorithm that circumvents the CSQ hardness barrier for learning intersections of halfspaces, achieving polynomial time complexity under factorizable distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning intersections of halfspaces is a major open problem in Computational Learning Theory, with best-known algorithms running in quasi-polynomial time and CSQ-based methods shown to require this complexity.

Method: The algorithm uses a novel duality framework to analyze moment tensor structure, combining refined Jennrich's Algorithm with PCA over random projections and gradient-descent-based non-convex optimization.

Result: The algorithm achieves poly(d,1/γ) time complexity under factorizable distributions, establishing a strong separation between CSQ and SQ for this learning problem.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that more general statistical queries (SQ) can overcome CSQ hardness barriers for learning intersections of halfspaces under natural distributional assumptions.

Abstract: Learning intersections of halfspaces is a central problem in Computational Learning Theory. Even for just two halfspaces, it remains a major open question whether learning is possible in polynomial time with respect to the margin $γ$ of the data points and their dimensionality $d$. The best-known algorithms run in quasi-polynomial time $d^{O(\log(1/γ))}$, and it has been shown that this complexity is unavoidable for any algorithm relying solely on correlational statistical queries (CSQ).
  In this work, we introduce a novel algorithm that provably circumvents the CSQ hardness barrier. Our approach applies to a broad class of distributions satisfying a natural, previously studied, factorizability assumption. Factorizable distributions lie between distribution-specific and distribution-free settings, and significantly extend previously known tractable cases. Under these distributions, we show that CSQ-based methods still require quasipolynomial time even for weakly learning, whereas our algorithm achieves $poly(d,1/γ)$ time by leveraging more general statistical queries (SQ), establishing a strong separation between CSQ and SQ for this simple realizable PAC learning problem.
  Our result is grounded in a rigorous analysis utilizing a novel duality framework that characterizes the moment tensor structure induced by the marginal distributions. Building on these structural insights, we propose new, efficient learning algorithms. These algorithms combine a refined variant of Jennrich's Algorithm with PCA over random projections of the moment tensor, along with a gradient-descent-based non-convex optimization framework.

TL;DR: ACT pipeline uses LLMs as both annotators and judges to identify potential errors, directing human effort to review only suspicious cases, achieving near-human performance while saving up to 90% of human costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human annotation is expensive and time-consuming, and existing LLM-generated labels fall short of human-level quality, creating a need for more efficient and accurate annotation methods.

Method: ACT pipeline where LLMs serve as annotators and judges to identify potential errors, with human reviewers focusing only on suspicious cases; includes theoretical analysis of loss function modification and empirical derivation of 7 insights for quality enhancement.

Result: Performance gap reduced to less than 2% on most benchmark datasets compared to fully human-annotated data while saving up to 90% of human costs.

Conclusion: ACT provides an effective framework for high-quality data annotation that significantly improves human efficiency while maintaining near-human performance levels across NLP, CV, and multimodal domains.

Abstract: Supervised learning relies on high-quality labeled data, but obtaining such data through human annotation is both expensive and time-consuming. Recent work explores using large language models (LLMs) for annotation, but LLM-generated labels still fall short of human-level quality. To address this problem, we propose the Annotation with Critical Thinking (ACT) data pipeline, where LLMs serve not only as annotators but also as judges to critically identify potential errors. Human effort is then directed towards reviewing only the most "suspicious" cases, significantly improving the human annotation efficiency. Our major contributions are as follows: (1) ACT is applicable to a wide range of domains, including natural language processing (NLP), computer vision (CV), and multimodal understanding, by leveraging multimodal-LLMs (MLLMs). (2) Through empirical studies, we derive 7 insights on how to enhance annotation quality while efficiently reducing the human cost, and then translate these findings into user-friendly guidelines. (3) We theoretically analyze how to modify the loss function so that models trained on ACT data achieve similar performance to those trained on fully human-annotated data. Our experiments show that the performance gap can be reduced to less than 2% on most benchmark datasets while saving up to 90% of human costs.

*Frédéric Berdoz,Peer Rheinboldt,Roger Wattenhofer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Improves speculative decoding by adding a lightweight dynamic alignment mechanism using steering vectors from verifier to pretrained drafter, boosting token acceptance by up to 35% with negligible overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address drafter-verifier misalignment in speculative decoding that limits token acceptance rates, especially when using pretrained drafters that have strong generation capabilities but suffer from alignment issues.

Method: Introduces a lightweight dynamic alignment mechanism using steering vectors computed from verifier's hidden states and injected into the pretrained drafter, enabling real-time alignment without heavy computation.

Result: Boosts accepted tokens by up to 35% under standard sampling and 22% under greedy sampling, with negligible computational overhead. Can be retrofitted to existing architectures.

Conclusion: Dynamic alignment mechanism effectively improves pretrained drafter performance in speculative decoding, offering significant token acceptance improvements with minimal overhead and easy adoption.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates language model inference by separating generation into fast drafting and parallel verification. Its main limitation is drafter-verifier misalignment, which limits token acceptance and reduces overall effectiveness. While small drafting heads trained from scratch compensate with speed, they struggle when verification dominates latency or when inputs are out of distribution. In contrast, pretrained drafters, though slower, achieve higher acceptance rates thanks to stronger standalone generation capabilities, making them competitive when drafting latency is negligible relative to verification or communication overhead. In this work, we aim to improve the acceptance rates of pretrained drafters by introducing a lightweight dynamic alignment mechanism: a steering vector computed from the verifier's hidden states and injected into the pretrained drafter. Compared to existing offline alignment methods such as distillation, our approach boosts the number of accepted tokens by up to 35\% under standard sampling and 22\% under greedy sampling, all while incurring negligible computational overhead. Importantly, our approach can be retrofitted to existing architectures and pretrained models, enabling rapid adoption.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ConSurv is the first multimodal continual learning method for survival analysis that addresses catastrophic forgetting and complex inter-modal interactions between whole slide images and genomics using Multi-staged Mixture of Experts and Feature Constrained Replay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static survival prediction models fail to adapt to evolving clinical environments and continuous data streams, while existing continual learning methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting and only handle unimodal inputs, neglecting the comprehensive information from multimodal inputs like whole slide images and genomics.

Method: ConSurv uses two key components: Multi-staged Mixture of Experts (MS-MoE) to capture task-shared and task-specific knowledge at different learning stages, and Feature Constrained Replay (FCR) to mitigate forgetting by restricting feature deviation of previous data at encoder-level and fusion-level representations.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConSurv outperforms competing methods across multiple metrics on the newly introduced Multimodal Survival Analysis Incremental Learning (MSAIL) benchmark.

Conclusion: ConSurv successfully addresses the challenges of catastrophic forgetting and complex inter-modal interactions in multimodal continual learning for survival analysis, providing an effective solution for dynamic clinical environments.

Abstract: Survival prediction of cancers is crucial for clinical practice, as it informs mortality risks and influences treatment plans. However, a static model trained on a single dataset fails to adapt to the dynamically evolving clinical environment and continuous data streams, limiting its practical utility. While continual learning (CL) offers a solution to learn dynamically from new datasets, existing CL methods primarily focus on unimodal inputs and suffer from severe catastrophic forgetting in survival prediction. In real-world scenarios, multimodal inputs often provide comprehensive and complementary information, such as whole slide images and genomics; and neglecting inter-modal correlations negatively impacts the performance. To address the two challenges of catastrophic forgetting and complex inter-modal interactions between gigapixel whole slide images and genomics, we propose ConSurv, the first multimodal continual learning (MMCL) method for survival analysis. ConSurv incorporates two key components: Multi-staged Mixture of Experts (MS-MoE) and Feature Constrained Replay (FCR). MS-MoE captures both task-shared and task-specific knowledge at different learning stages of the network, including two modality encoders and the modality fusion component, learning inter-modal relationships. FCR further enhances learned knowledge and mitigates forgetting by restricting feature deviation of previous data at different levels, including encoder-level features of two modalities and the fusion-level representations. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark integrating four datasets, Multimodal Survival Analysis Incremental Learning (MSAIL), for comprehensive evaluation in the CL setting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConSurv outperforms competing methods across multiple metrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Survey of machine unlearning methods for LLMs, examining technical solutions and institutional safeguards to ensure sensitive information can be permanently forgotten while maintaining privacy and trust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack reliable mechanisms to permanently remove sensitive information after use, with existing unlearning methods being fragmented, difficult to verify, and vulnerable to recovery attacks.

Method: Reviews evaluation methods for forgetting, resilience against adversarial attacks, and trust mechanisms. Examines technical solutions (differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, federated learning, ephemeral memory) and institutional safeguards (auditing, regulatory frameworks).

Result: Finds steady progress but robust and verifiable unlearning remains unresolved. Identifies need for efficient techniques avoiding costly retraining, stronger defenses against adversarial recovery, and governance structures for accountability.

Conclusion: By integrating technical and organizational perspectives, outlines pathway toward AI systems that can be required to forget while maintaining privacy and public trust in sensitive applications.

Abstract: The growing use of large language models in sensitive domains has exposed a critical weakness: the inability to ensure that private information can be permanently forgotten. Yet these systems still lack reliable mechanisms to guarantee that sensitive information can be permanently removed once it has been used. Retraining from the beginning is prohibitively costly, and existing unlearning methods remain fragmented, difficult to verify, and often vulnerable to recovery. This paper surveys recent research on machine unlearning for LLMs and considers how far current approaches can address these challenges. We review methods for evaluating whether forgetting has occurred, the resilience of unlearned models against adversarial attacks, and mechanisms that can support user trust when model complexity or proprietary limits restrict transparency. Technical solutions such as differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, federated learning, and ephemeral memory are examined alongside institutional safeguards including auditing practices and regulatory frameworks. The review finds steady progress, but robust and verifiable unlearning is still unresolved. Efficient techniques that avoid costly retraining, stronger defenses against adversarial recovery, and governance structures that reinforce accountability are needed if LLMs are to be deployed safely in sensitive applications. By integrating technical and organizational perspectives, this study outlines a pathway toward AI systems that can be required to forget, while maintaining both privacy and public trust.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UGCS is an uncertainty-guided checkpoint selection method that identifies the best LLM checkpoints by ranking them based on how well they handle the most uncertain question-answer pairs, outperforming traditional validation-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL finetuning of LLMs is unstable with high variance across checkpoints, making checkpoint selection challenging due to computational costs of validation evaluation and unreliability of final checkpoints.

Method: UGCS identifies hard question-answer pairs using per-sample uncertainty and ranks checkpoints by their performance on these challenging cases, averaging rewards of top-uncertain samples over a short training window.

Result: Experiments across three datasets and three LLMs show UGCS consistently identifies checkpoints with stronger generalization, outperforming traditional training or validation performance strategies.

Conclusion: Models that solve their hardest tasks with low uncertainty are the most reliable overall, and UGCS provides a stable, discriminative signal for checkpoint selection without significant computation overhead.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) finetuning is crucial to aligning large language models (LLMs), but the process is notoriously unstable and exhibits high variance across model checkpoints. In practice, selecting the best checkpoint is challenging: evaluating checkpoints on the validation set during training is computationally expensive and requires a good validation set, while relying on the final checkpoint provides no guarantee of good performance. We introduce an uncertainty-guided approach for checkpoint selection (UGCS) that avoids these pitfalls. Our method identifies hard question-answer pairs using per-sample uncertainty and ranks checkpoints by how well they handle these challenging cases. By averaging the rewards of the top-uncertain samples over a short training window, our method produces a stable and discriminative signal without additional forward passes or significant computation overhead. Experiments across three datasets and three LLMs demonstrate that it consistently identifies checkpoints with stronger generalization, outperforming traditional strategies such as relying on training or validation performance. These results highlight that models solving their hardest tasks with low uncertainty are the most reliable overall.

TL;DR: A novel continual learning method with two complementary differentiable memories: one for shared features across tasks and another for sample-specific discriminative features, using adaptive memory expansion and orthogonal regularization to prevent interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional continual learning methods isolate sequential tasks, preventing networks from leveraging inter-task relationships and causing repeated relearning of similar features or excessive differentiation.

Method: Uses two differentiable memories: shared memory for common features across tasks and sample-specific memory for discriminative characteristics. Includes memory adjustment module for adaptive pruning and minimal expansion, with orthogonal regularization to separate preserved and new memory components.

Result: Outperforms 14 state-of-the-art methods on CIFAR-10 (55.13%), CIFAR-100 (37.24%), and Tiny-ImageNet (30.11%), achieving feature extraction closest to the upper bound.

Conclusion: Establishes a new milestone in continual learning by effectively integrating and utilizing knowledge across sequential tasks through the proposed memory architecture.

Abstract: Continual learning methods used to force neural networks to process sequential tasks in isolation, preventing them from leveraging useful inter-task relationships and causing them to repeatedly relearn similar features or overly differentiate them. To address this problem, we propose a fully differentiable, exemplar-free expandable method composed of two complementary memories: One learns common features that can be used across all tasks, and the other combines the shared features to learn discriminative characteristics unique to each sample. Both memories are differentiable so that the network can autonomously learn latent representations for each sample. For each task, the memory adjustment module adaptively prunes critical slots and minimally expands capacity to accommodate new concepts, and orthogonal regularization enforces geometric separation between preserved and newly learned memory components to prevent interference. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet show that the proposed method outperforms 14 state-of-the-art methods for class-incremental learning, achieving final accuracies of 55.13\%, 37.24\%, and 30.11\%, respectively. Additional analysis confirms that, through effective integration and utilization of knowledge, the proposed method can increase average performance across sequential tasks, and it produces feature extraction results closest to the upper bound, thus establishing a new milestone in continual learning.

Motivation: Existing fair clustering algorithms suffer from quadratic or super-quadratic computational complexity, making them impractical for large-scale datasets.

Method: Anchor-based Fair Clustering Framework (AFCF) with fair anchor sampling, applying existing algorithms to anchors, and novel anchor graph construction with group-label joint constraint optimization solved via ADMM.

Result: AFCF drastically accelerates state-of-the-art methods by orders of magnitude while maintaining strong clustering performance and fairness guarantees on large-scale benchmarks.

Conclusion: AFCF provides a practical solution for large-scale fair clustering by enabling linear-time scalability without sacrificing fairness or clustering quality.

Abstract: Fair clustering is crucial for mitigating bias in unsupervised learning, yet existing algorithms often suffer from quadratic or super-quadratic computational complexity, rendering them impractical for large-scale datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Anchor-based Fair Clustering Framework (AFCF), a novel, general, and plug-and-play framework that empowers arbitrary fair clustering algorithms with linear-time scalability. Our approach first selects a small but representative set of anchors using a novel fair sampling strategy. Then, any off-the-shelf fair clustering algorithm can be applied to this small anchor set. The core of our framework lies in a novel anchor graph construction module, where we formulate an optimization problem to propagate labels while preserving fairness. This is achieved through a carefully designed group-label joint constraint, which we prove theoretically ensures that the fairness of the final clustering on the entire dataset matches that of the anchor clustering. We solve this optimization efficiently using an ADMM-based algorithm. Extensive experiments on multiple large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that AFCF drastically accelerates state-of-the-art methods, which reduces computational time by orders of magnitude while maintaining strong clustering performance and fairness guarantees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ECG generation methods overlook physiological simulator knowledge and clinical experience, limiting their realism and clinical relevance. Large annotated ECG datasets are scarce due to cost, privacy, and workflow constraints.

Method: SE-Diff integrates an ODE-based ECG simulator via beat decoder and simulator-consistent constraints, and uses LLM-powered experience retrieval to inject clinical knowledge into the diffusion process.

Result: Extensive experiments show SE-Diff improves signal fidelity and text-ECG semantic alignment over baselines, and the integrated knowledge also benefits downstream ECG classification tasks.

Conclusion: SE-Diff successfully addresses gaps in ECG generation by incorporating both physiological simulator knowledge and clinical experience, demonstrating superior performance for text-to-ECG generation and downstream applications.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are the most widely used non-invasive tool for cardiac assessment, yet large, well-annotated ECG corpora are scarce due to cost, privacy, and workflow constraints. Generating ECGs can be beneficial for the mechanistic understanding of cardiac electrical activity, enable the construction of large, heterogeneous, and unbiased datasets, and facilitate privacy-preserving data sharing. Generating realistic ECG signals from clinical context is important yet underexplored. Recent work has leveraged diffusion models for text-to-ECG generation, but two challenges remain: (i) existing methods often overlook the physiological simulator knowledge of cardiac activity; and (ii) they ignore broader, experience-based clinical knowledge grounded in real-world practice. To address these gaps, we propose SE-Diff, a novel physiological simulator and experience enhanced diffusion model for comprehensive ECG generation. SE-Diff integrates a lightweight ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based ECG simulator into the diffusion process via a beat decoder and simulator-consistent constraints, injecting mechanistic priors that promote physiologically plausible waveforms. In parallel, we design an LLM-powered experience retrieval-augmented strategy to inject clinical knowledge, providing more guidance for ECG generation. Extensive experiments on real-world ECG datasets demonstrate that SE-Diff improves both signal fidelity and text-ECG semantic alignment over baselines, proving its superiority for text-to-ECG generation. We further show that the simulator-based and experience-based knowledge also benefit downstream ECG classification.

Motivation: Modern deep neural networks face substantial computational costs from massive model weights and training samples. The paper explores the interplay between redundant weights and training samples to improve computational efficiency.

Method: Developed Simultaneous Weight and Sample Tailoring (SWaST) that alternately performs weight pruning and coreset selection. Integrated a state preservation mechanism to prevent critical double-loss where important weights and supportive samples are mistakenly eliminated simultaneously.

Result: Extensive experiments show strong synergy between pruning and coreset selection, delivering accuracy boosts up to 17.83% alongside 10% to 90% FLOPs reductions.

Conclusion: The interplay between weight pruning and coreset selection can be effectively harnessed through SWaST, achieving significant computational efficiency improvements while maintaining or enhancing model accuracy.

Abstract: Modern deep neural networks rely heavily on massive model weights and training samples, incurring substantial computational costs. Weight pruning and coreset selection are two emerging paradigms proposed to improve computational efficiency. In this paper, we first explore the interplay between redundant weights and training samples through a transparent analysis: redundant samples, particularly noisy ones, cause model weights to become unnecessarily overtuned to fit them, complicating the identification of irrelevant weights during pruning; conversely, irrelevant weights tend to overfit noisy data, undermining coreset selection effectiveness. To further investigate and harness this interplay in deep learning, we develop a Simultaneous Weight and Sample Tailoring mechanism (SWaST) that alternately performs weight pruning and coreset selection to establish a synergistic effect in training. During this investigation, we observe that when simultaneously removing a large number of weights and samples, a phenomenon we term critical double-loss can occur, where important weights and their supportive samples are mistakenly eliminated at the same time, leading to model instability and nearly irreversible degradation that cannot be recovered in subsequent training. Unlike classic machine learning models, this issue can arise in deep learning due to the lack of theoretical guarantees on the correctness of weight pruning and coreset selection, which explains why these paradigms are often developed independently. We mitigate this by integrating a state preservation mechanism into SWaST, enabling stable joint optimization. Extensive experiments reveal a strong synergy between pruning and coreset selection across varying prune rates and coreset sizes, delivering accuracy boosts of up to 17.83% alongside 10% to 90% FLOPs reductions.

### [202] [Incremental Generation is Necessity and Sufficient for Universality in Flow-Based Modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09902)
*Hossein Rouhvarzi,Anastasis Kratsios*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Incremental flow-based denoising models are necessary and sufficient for universal approximation of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms on [0,1]^d, with single-step flows being insufficient but compositions of multiple flows achieving optimal approximation rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a rigorous approximation-theoretic foundation for incremental flow-based denoising models and understand their empirical advantages compared to single-step flows.

Method: Using topological-dynamical arguments to prove impossibility of universal approximation with single-step autonomous flows, then exploiting algebraic properties to show that compositions of multiple flows can achieve universal approximation with optimal rates.

Result: Single-step flows are meagre and not universal, but compositions of K_d flows can approximate any orientation-preserving Lipschitz homeomorphism at rate O(n^{-1/d}), with dimension-free rates under smoothness assumptions.

Conclusion: Incremental generation is both necessary and sufficient for universal flow-based generation, providing theoretical justification for the empirical success of denoising diffusion models.

Abstract: Incremental flow-based denoising models have reshaped generative modelling, but their empirical advantage still lacks a rigorous approximation-theoretic foundation. We show that incremental generation is necessary and sufficient for universal flow-based generation on the largest natural class of self-maps of $[0,1]^d$ compatible with denoising pipelines, namely the orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of $[0,1]^d$. All our guarantees are uniform on the underlying maps and hence imply approximation both samplewise and in distribution.
  Using a new topological-dynamical argument, we first prove an impossibility theorem: the class of all single-step autonomous flows, independently of the architecture, width, depth, or Lipschitz activation of the underlying neural network, is meagre and therefore not universal in the space of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of $[0,1]^d$. By exploiting algebraic properties of autonomous flows, we conversely show that every orientation-preserving Lipschitz homeomorphism on $[0,1]^d$ can be approximated at rate $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/d})$ by a composition of at most $K_d$ such flows, where $K_d$ depends only on the dimension. Under additional smoothness assumptions, the approximation rate can be made dimension-free, and $K_d$ can be chosen uniformly over the class being approximated. Finally, by linearly lifting the domain into one higher dimension, we obtain structured universal approximation results for continuous functions and for probability measures on $[0,1]^d$, the latter realized as pushforwards of empirical measures with vanishing $1$-Wasserstein error.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRISM is a dataset distillation framework that uses multiple teacher models with different architectures to generate more diverse synthetic data, addressing the bias problem in single-teacher approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dataset distillation methods inherit inductive bias from single teacher models, leading to overly smooth and homogeneous synthetic samples with reduced intra-class diversity, which limits generalization as dataset size increases.

Method: PRISM decouples logit-matching and regularization objectives, supervising them with different teacher architectures: a primary model for logits and a stochastic subset for batch-normalization alignment. It also introduces scalable cross-class batch formation for fast parallel synthesis.

Result: On ImageNet-1K, PRISM consistently outperforms single-teacher methods (SRe2L) and multi-teacher variants (G-VBSM) at low- and mid-IPC regimes, with significantly richer intra-class diversity reflected by notable drop in cosine similarity between features.

Conclusion: PRISM effectively addresses architectural bias in dataset distillation by leveraging diverse teacher models, producing more diverse synthetic data that improves generalization performance.

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) promises compact yet faithful synthetic data, but existing approaches often inherit the inductive bias of a single teacher model. As dataset size increases, this bias drives generation toward overly smooth, homogeneous samples, reducing intra-class diversity and limiting generalization. We present PRISM (PRIors from diverse Source Models), a framework that disentangles architectural priors during synthesis. PRISM decouples the logit-matching and regularization objectives, supervising them with different teacher architectures: a primary model for logits and a stochastic subset for batch-normalization (BN) alignment. On ImageNet-1K, PRISM consistently and reproducibly outperforms single-teacher methods (e.g., SRe2L) and recent multi-teacher variants (e.g., G-VBSM) at low- and mid-IPC regimes. The generated data also show significantly richer intra-class diversity, as reflected by a notable drop in cosine similarity between features. We further analyze teacher selection strategies (pre- vs. intra-distillation) and introduce a scalable cross-class batch formation scheme for fast parallel synthesis. Code will be released after the review period.

### [204] [Towards Multiple Missing Values-resistant Unsupervised Graph Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09917)
*Jiazhen Chen,Xiuqin Liang,Sichao Fu,Zheng Ma,Weihua Ou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: M²V-UGAD is an unsupervised graph anomaly detection framework that handles multiple missing values in graphs by using dual-pathway encoding to prevent cross-view interference and sampling hard negative examples to mitigate imputation bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world graph data often has incomplete node attributes and structure due to privacy, collection errors, or dynamic node arrivals. Standard imputation methods can 'repair' anomalies to appear normal, and missing data in one view can contaminate the other view through cross-view interference.

Method: Uses dual-pathway encoder to independently reconstruct missing node attributes and graph structure, preventing error propagation. Fuses pathways in joint latent space where normals occupy compact inner manifold and anomalies reside on outer shell. Samples latent codes outside normal region to generate hard negative examples that sharpen decision boundary.

Result: Experiments on seven public benchmarks show M²V-UGAD consistently outperforms existing unsupervised GAD methods across varying missing rates.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively handles incomplete graph data for anomaly detection by preventing cross-view interference and mitigating imputation bias through hard negative sampling.

Abstract: Unsupervised graph anomaly detection (GAD) has received increasing attention in recent years, which aims to identify data anomalous patterns utilizing only unlabeled node information from graph-structured data. However, prevailing unsupervised GAD methods typically presuppose complete node attributes and structure information, a condition hardly satisfied in real-world scenarios owing to privacy, collection errors or dynamic node arrivals. Existing standard imputation schemes risk "repairing" rare anomalous nodes so that they appear normal, thereby introducing imputation bias into the detection process. In addition, when both node attributes and edges are missing simultaneously, estimation errors in one view can contaminate the other, causing cross-view interference that further undermines the detection performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose M$^2$V-UGAD, a multiple missing values-resistant unsupervised GAD framework on incomplete graphs. Specifically, a dual-pathway encoder is first proposed to independently reconstruct missing node attributes and graph structure, thereby preventing errors in one view from propagating to the other. The two pathways are then fused and regularized in a joint latent space so that normals occupy a compact inner manifold while anomalies reside on an outer shell. Lastly, to mitigate imputation bias, we sample latent codes just outside the normal region and decode them into realistic node features and subgraphs, providing hard negative examples that sharpen the decision boundary. Experiments on seven public benchmarks demonstrate that M$^2$V-UGAD consistently outperforms existing unsupervised GAD methods across varying missing rates.

TL;DR: TD-ES uses bounded triangular noise and centered-rank finite-difference estimator for stable, parallelizable policy refinement, improving robotic manipulation success rates by 26.5% over PPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: On-policy RL often suffers from noisy, low-signal gradients when refining competent robot policies, limiting performance improvements.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: PPO pretraining followed by TD-ES refinement using bounded antithetic triangular perturbations and centered-rank finite-difference estimator.

Result: Across robotic manipulation tasks, TD-ES increases success rates by 26.5% relative to PPO and significantly reduces variance.

Conclusion: TD-ES offers a simple, compute-light path to reliable policy refinement that preserves early sample efficiency while enabling robust late-stage gains.

Abstract: Improving competent robot policies with on-policy RL is often hampered by noisy, low-signal gradients. We revisit Evolution Strategies (ES) as a policy-gradient proxy and localize exploration with bounded, antithetic triangular perturbations, suitable for policy refinement. We propose Triangular-Distribution ES (TD-ES) which pairs bounded triangular noise with a centered-rank finite-difference estimator to deliver stable, parallelizable, gradient-free updates. In a two-stage pipeline -- PPO pretraining followed by TD-ES refinement -- this preserves early sample efficiency while enabling robust late-stage gains. Across a suite of robotic manipulation tasks, TD-ES raises success rates by 26.5% relative to PPO and greatly reduces variance, offering a simple, compute-light path to reliable refinement.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MDMLP-EIA is a novel MLP-based time series forecasting method that addresses limitations of existing MLP approaches through adaptive dual-domain seasonal processing, energy invariant attention, and dynamic capacity adjustment, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome critical limitations in MLP-based time series forecasting methods, including loss of weak seasonal signals, capacity constraints in weight-sharing MLPs, and insufficient channel fusion in channel-independent strategies.

Method: Proposes MDMLP-EIA with three innovations: 1) Adaptive fused dual-domain seasonal MLP that categorizes seasonal signals into strong/weak components with adaptive zero-initialized channel fusion; 2) Energy invariant attention mechanism for adaptive feature channel focus while maintaining constant signal energy; 3) Dynamic capacity adjustment that scales neuron count with square root of channel count.

Result: Extensive experiments across nine benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: MDMLP-EIA effectively addresses key limitations of MLP-based forecasting methods and achieves superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is essential across diverse domains. While MLP-based methods have gained attention for achieving Transformer-comparable performance with fewer parameters and better robustness, they face critical limitations including loss of weak seasonal signals, capacity constraints in weight-sharing MLPs, and insufficient channel fusion in channel-independent strategies. To address these challenges, we propose MDMLP-EIA (Multi-domain Dynamic MLPs with Energy Invariant Attention) with three key innovations. First, we develop an adaptive fused dual-domain seasonal MLP that categorizes seasonal signals into strong and weak components. It employs an adaptive zero-initialized channel fusion strategy to minimize noise interference while effectively integrating predictions. Second, we introduce an energy invariant attention mechanism that adaptively focuses on different feature channels within trend and seasonal predictions across time steps. This mechanism maintains constant total signal energy to align with the decomposition-prediction-reconstruction framework and enhance robustness against disturbances. Third, we propose a dynamic capacity adjustment mechanism for channel-independent MLPs. This mechanism scales neuron count with the square root of channel count, ensuring sufficient capacity as channels increase. Extensive experiments across nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that MDMLP-EIA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.

Motivation: Current EEG models are task-specific, limiting utility in realistic multi-task scenarios. There's a need for scalable and generalizable brain activity analysis for clinical diagnostics and cognitive research.

Method: Leverages large language models to schedule and plan multiple tools from a designed toolbox for EEG preprocessing, feature extraction, event detection, and other EEG-related tasks.

Result: Evaluated on public datasets, EEGAgent supports flexible and interpretable EEG analysis, demonstrating potential for real-world clinical applications.

Conclusion: EEGAgent provides a general-purpose framework that overcomes limitations of task-specific EEG models, enabling automated multi-task EEG analysis with practical clinical utility.

Abstract: Scalable and generalizable analysis of brain activity is essential for advancing both clinical diagnostics and cognitive research. Electroencephalography (EEG), a non-invasive modality with high temporal resolution, has been widely used for brain states analysis. However, most existing EEG models are usually tailored for individual specific tasks, limiting their utility in realistic scenarios where EEG analysis often involves multi-task and continuous reasoning. In this work, we introduce EEGAgent, a general-purpose framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to schedule and plan multiple tools to automatically complete EEG-related tasks. EEGAgent is capable of performing the key functions: EEG basic information perception, spatiotemporal EEG exploration, EEG event detection, interaction with users, and EEG report generation. To realize these capabilities, we design a toolbox composed of different tools for EEG preprocessing, feature extraction, event detection, etc. These capabilities were evaluated on public datasets, and our EEGAgent can support flexible and interpretable EEG analysis, highlighting its potential for real-world clinical applications.

*Pengqian Lu,Jie Lu,Anjin Liu,En Yu,Guangquan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes dynamic threshold adjustment for drift detection, proving it outperforms fixed thresholds and enhancing existing detectors with a comparison phase.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model performance is highly sensitive to drift detection thresholds, and fixed thresholds fail to adapt across datasets and over time, limiting effectiveness.

Method: Proves dynamic thresholds outperform fixed ones, then develops Dynamic Threshold Determination algorithm that adds comparison phase to existing drift detectors.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art drift detectors.

Conclusion: Dynamic threshold adaptation is provably better than fixed thresholds and significantly enhances drift detection performance across diverse data types.

Abstract: Existing drift detection methods focus on designing sensitive test statistics. They treat the detection threshold as a fixed hyperparameter, set once to balance false alarms and late detections, and applied uniformly across all datasets and over time. However, maintaining model performance is the key objective from the perspective of machine learning, and we observe that model performance is highly sensitive to this threshold. This observation inspires us to investigate whether a dynamic threshold could be provably better. In this paper, we prove that a threshold that adapts over time can outperform any single fixed threshold. The main idea of the proof is that a dynamic strategy, constructed by combining the best threshold from each individual data segment, is guaranteed to outperform any single threshold that apply to all segments. Based on the theorem, we propose a Dynamic Threshold Determination algorithm. It enhances existing drift detection frameworks with a novel comparison phase to inform how the threshold should be adjusted. Extensive experiments on a wide range of synthetic and real-world datasets, including both image and tabular data, validate that our approach substantially enhances the performance of state-of-the-art drift detectors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting AIGC diffusion is challenging due to data heterogeneity, nonlinear propagation, and evolving consumer interactions in digital marketing.

Method: Hybrid GNN and Temporal Transformer framework integrating multi-source data (social media, marketing spend, engagement logs, sentiment) with dual-channel architecture and causal inference modules.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines on all six metrics using large-scale real-world datasets from Twitter, TikTok, and YouTube advertising platforms.

Conclusion: The DSS enhances marketing decisions by providing interpretable real-time insights into AIGC content dissemination and market growth patterns.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of AI-generated content (AIGC) has reshaped the dynamics of digital marketing and online consumer behavior. However, predicting the diffusion trajectory and market impact of such content remains challenging due to data heterogeneity, non linear propagation mechanisms, and evolving consumer interactions. This study proposes an AI driven Decision Support System (DSS) that integrates multi source data including social media streams, marketing expenditure records, consumer engagement logs, and sentiment dynamics using a hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN) and Temporal Transformer framework. The model jointly learns the content diffusion structure and temporal influence evolution through a dual channel architecture, while causal inference modules disentangle the effects of marketing stimuli on return on investment (ROI) and market visibility. Experiments on large scale real-world datasets collected from multiple online platforms such as Twitter, TikTok, and YouTube advertising show that our system outperforms existing baselines in all six metrics. The proposed DSS enhances marketing decisions by providing interpretable real-time insights into AIGC driven content dissemination and market growth patterns.

TL;DR: MultiTab-Net is the first multitask transformer architecture for large tabular data, featuring a novel multitask masked-attention mechanism that improves generalization across diverse domains while mitigating task competition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tabular data is abundant but existing multitask learning approaches are limited to recommendation systems and use MLP backbones that struggle with complex feature interactions and scalability. Transformers have shown success in other domains but haven't been adapted for multitask tabular data.

Method: MultiTab-Net uses a transformer architecture with a novel multitask masked-attention mechanism that dynamically models feature-feature dependencies while reducing task competition. The authors also created MultiTab-Bench, a synthetic dataset generator for systematic evaluation.

Result: MultiTab-Net consistently achieves higher multitask gain than existing MTL architectures and single-task transformers across diverse domains including recommendation systems, socioeconomic data, and physics datasets, handling various task counts, types, and feature modalities.

Conclusion: MultiTab-Net successfully bridges the gap between transformer architectures and multitask learning for tabular data, demonstrating superior performance and scalability while providing a systematic evaluation framework through MultiTab-Bench.

Abstract: Tabular data is the most abundant data type in the world, powering systems in finance, healthcare, e-commerce, and beyond. As tabular datasets grow and span multiple related targets, there is an increasing need to exploit shared task information for improved multitask generalization. Multitask learning (MTL) has emerged as a powerful way to improve generalization and efficiency, yet most existing work focuses narrowly on large-scale recommendation systems, leaving its potential in broader tabular domains largely underexplored. Also, existing MTL approaches for tabular data predominantly rely on multi-layer perceptron-based backbones, which struggle to capture complex feature interactions and often fail to scale when data is abundant, a limitation that transformer architectures have overcome in other domains. Motivated by this, we introduce MultiTab-Net, the first multitask transformer architecture specifically designed for large tabular data. MultiTab-Net employs a novel multitask masked-attention mechanism that dynamically models feature-feature dependencies while mitigating task competition. Through extensive experiments, we show that MultiTab-Net consistently achieves higher multitask gain than existing MTL architectures and single-task transformers across diverse domains including large-scale recommendation data, census-like socioeconomic data, and physics datasets, spanning a wide range of task counts, task types, and feature modalities. In addition, we contribute MultiTab-Bench, a generalized multitask synthetic dataset generator that enables systematic evaluation of multitask dynamics by tuning task count, task correlations, and relative task complexity.

Motivation: To explore whether symbolic regression can automatically rediscover fundamental astronomical equations like the Equation of the Centre, and to understand how domain knowledge can be effectively incorporated into such automated discovery processes.

Method: Used AI Feynman symbolic regression algorithm with observational and inductive biases through data preprocessing and search space restriction. Proposed automated preprocessing extension to find canonical coordinate systems.

Result: Successfully recovered the first-order analytical form of the Equation of the Centre from lunar ephemerides data, but highlighted limitations in manual coordinate system selection.

Conclusion: Targeted domain knowledge embedding enables symbolic regression to rediscover physical laws, but challenges remain in constraining symbolic regression to derive physics equations when using tailored biases.

Abstract: This work explores using the physics-inspired AI Feynman symbolic regression algorithm to automatically rediscover a fundamental equation in astronomy -- the Equation of the Centre. Through the introduction of observational and inductive biases corresponding to the physical nature of the system through data preprocessing and search space restriction, AI Feynman was successful in recovering the first-order analytical form of this equation from lunar ephemerides data. However, this manual approach highlights a key limitation in its reliance on expert-driven coordinate system selection. We therefore propose an automated preprocessing extension to find the canonical coordinate system. Results demonstrate that targeted domain knowledge embedding enables symbolic regression to rediscover physical laws, but also highlight further challenges in constraining symbolic regression to derive physics equations when leveraging domain knowledge through tailored biases.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural network models perform well in controlled settings but fail in real-world open environments with unpredictable dynamics, incomplete modality inputs, and spurious distribution relations, creating a gap between experimental performance and practical deployment.

Method: The study investigates multimodal learning robustness in open-world settings, though the specific methodology is not detailed in the abstract.

Result: The abstract does not provide specific results, focusing instead on identifying the problem and research direction.

Conclusion: There is a critical need to bridge the gap between controlled experimental performance and practical deployment requirements for multimodal learning systems in open-world environments.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of machine learning has propelled neural networks to unprecedented success across diverse domains. In particular, multimodal learning has emerged as a transformative paradigm, leveraging complementary information from heterogeneous data streams (e.g., text, vision, audio) to advance contextual reasoning and intelligent decision-making. Despite these advancements, current neural network-based models often fall short in open-world environments characterized by inherent unpredictability, where unpredictable environmental composition dynamics, incomplete modality inputs, and spurious distributions relations critically undermine system reliability. While humans naturally adapt to such dynamic, ambiguous scenarios, artificial intelligence systems exhibit stark limitations in robustness, particularly when processing multimodal signals under real-world complexity. This study investigates the fundamental challenge of multimodal learning robustness in open-world settings, aiming to bridge the gap between controlled experimental performance and practical deployment requirements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address learning with large candidate model sets where uniform convergence of empirical to true losses fails, reducing reliance on prior assumptions compared to SRM/regularization approaches.

Method: Proposed learning paradigm that strongly incorporates empirical data, requiring fewer algorithmic decisions based on prior assumptions, and works without knowing true parameters of learning assumptions.

Result: Analyzed generalization capabilities and demonstrated merits in various learning assumptions including similarity of close points, clustering into label-homogeneous regions, Lipschitzness, and contrastive learning.

Conclusion: The approach enables utilization of learning assumptions without requiring prior knowledge of their true parameters, offering a more data-driven alternative to SRM-based methods.

Abstract: We address the general task of learning with a set of candidate models that is too large to have a uniform convergence of empirical estimates to true losses. While the common approach to such challenges is SRM (or regularization) based learning algorithms, we propose a novel learning paradigm that relies on stronger incorporation of empirical data and requires less algorithmic decisions to be based on prior assumptions. We analyze the generalization capabilities of our approach and demonstrate its merits in several common learning assumptions, including similarity of close points, clustering of the domain into highly label-homogeneous regions, Lipschitzness assumptions of the labeling rule, and contrastive learning assumptions. Our approach allows utilizing such assumptions without the need to know their true parameters a priori.

TL;DR: DemoTuner is an LLM-assisted demonstration reinforcement learning framework that leverages textual documents to improve DBMS knob tuning, achieving better performance and lower tuning costs than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual DBMS knob tuning is inefficient due to complex configuration spaces, and existing RL-based methods suffer from slow convergence during offline training. Textual documents contain valuable tuning hints that could accelerate training.

Method: Uses structured chain-of-thought prompts with LLMs to extract condition-aware tuning hints from documents, and implements a hint-aware demonstration reinforcement learning algorithm (HA-DDPGfD) to integrate these hints into RL agent training.

Result: Outperforms DB-BERT, GPTuner and CDBTune on MySQL and PostgreSQL across various workloads, showing significant performance improvements and reduced online tuning costs. Also demonstrates superior adaptability to unknown workloads.

Conclusion: DemoTuner successfully leverages textual knowledge to enhance RL-based DBMS tuning, being the first to apply demonstration reinforcement learning in this domain with proven effectiveness and adaptability.

Abstract: The performance of modern DBMSs such as MySQL and PostgreSQL heavily depends on the configuration of performance-critical knobs. Manual tuning these knobs is laborious and inefficient due to the complex and high-dimensional nature of the configuration space. Among the automated tuning methods, reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods have recently sought to improve the DBMS knobs tuning process from several different perspectives. However, they still encounter challenges with slow convergence speed during offline training. In this paper, we mainly focus on how to leverage the valuable tuning hints contained in various textual documents such as DBMS manuals and web forums to improve the offline training of RL-based methods. To this end, we propose an efficient DBMS knobs tuning framework named DemoTuner via a novel LLM-assisted demonstration reinforcement learning method. Specifically, to comprehensively and accurately mine tuning hints from documents, we design a structured chain of thought prompt to employ LLMs to conduct a condition-aware tuning hints extraction task. To effectively integrate the mined tuning hints into RL agent training, we propose a hint-aware demonstration reinforcement learning algorithm HA-DDPGfD in DemoTuner. As far as we know, DemoTuner is the first work to introduce the demonstration reinforcement learning algorithm for DBMS knobs tuning. Experimental evaluations conducted on MySQL and PostgreSQL across various workloads demonstrate the significant advantages of DemoTuner in both performance improvement and online tuning cost reduction over three representative baselines including DB-BERT, GPTuner and CDBTune. Additionally, DemoTuner also exhibits superior adaptability to application scenarios with unknown workloads.

*Pilsung Kang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A quantum-inspired approach models interaction through coherent aggregation of complex amplitudes, creating interference terms that control synergy vs antagonism, implemented in an Interference Kernel Classifier with competitive performance on synthetic and real datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical approaches offer limited control over interaction mechanisms. The paper aims to provide mechanism-level control over synergy and antagonism using quantum-inspired principles.

Method: Uses coherent aggregation of complex amplitudes following Born rule, creating interference cross-terms. Implements Interference Kernel Classifier (IKC) with phase control and introduces Coherent Gain and Interference Information diagnostics.

Result: IKC outperforms baselines on XOR task, competitive on real datasets (Adult, Bank Marketing). Toggling from incoherent to coherent aggregation consistently improves performance metrics with positive Coherent Gain.

Conclusion: Quantum-inspired coherent aggregation provides effective mechanism-level control over interaction patterns, with practical implementation showing consistent performance improvements across metrics.

Abstract: Classical approaches often treat interaction as engineered product terms or as emergent patterns in flexible models, offering little control over how synergy or antagonism arises. We take a quantum-inspired view: following the Born rule (probability as squared amplitude), \emph{coherent} aggregation sums complex amplitudes before squaring, creating an interference cross-term, whereas an \emph{incoherent} proxy sums squared magnitudes and removes it. In a minimal linear-amplitude model, this cross-term equals the standard potential-outcome interaction contrast \(Δ_{\mathrm{INT}}\) in a \(2\times 2\) factorial design, giving relative phase a direct, mechanism-level control over synergy versus antagonism.
  We instantiate this idea in a lightweight \emph{Interference Kernel Classifier} (IKC) and introduce two diagnostics: \emph{Coherent Gain} (log-likelihood gain of coherent over the incoherent proxy) and \emph{Interference Information} (the induced Kullback-Leibler gap). A controlled phase sweep recovers the identity. On a high-interaction synthetic task (XOR), IKC outperforms strong baselines under paired, budget-matched comparisons; on real tabular data (\emph{Adult} and \emph{Bank Marketing}) it is competitive overall but typically trails the most capacity-rich baseline in paired differences. Holding learned parameters fixed, toggling aggregation from incoherent to coherent consistently improves negative log-likelihood, Brier score, and expected calibration error, with positive Coherent Gain on both datasets.

*Chaofan Zhu,Xiaobing Rui,Zhixiao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphSB addresses imbalanced node classification by incorporating Structural Balance to optimize graph structure before node synthesis, solving the fundamental issue of imbalanced graph structure that causes majority-class dominance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for imbalanced node classification focus on data-level (synthesizing minority nodes) or algorithm-level (optimizing learning process) approaches, but neither addresses the inherently imbalanced graph structure that causes majority-class dominance and minority-class assimilation in GNNs.

Method: GraphSB uses Structural Balance with two-stage structure optimization: Structure Enhancement (building similarity-based edges to strengthen minority-class connectivity) and Relation Diffusion (capturing higher-order dependencies while amplifying minority-class signals).

Result: Extensive experiments show GraphSB significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and the Structural Balance module can be integrated as a plug-and-play component, increasing accuracy by an average of 3.67%.

Conclusion: GraphSB effectively addresses the fundamental issue of imbalanced graph structure in node classification, providing a novel framework that balances structural distribution before node synthesis for more effective GNN learning.

Abstract: Imbalanced node classification is a critical challenge in graph learning, where most existing methods typically utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn node representations. These methods can be broadly categorized into the data-level and the algorithm-level. The former aims to synthesize minority-class nodes to mitigate quantity imbalance, while the latter tries to optimize the learning process to highlight minority classes. However, neither category addresses the inherently imbalanced graph structure, which is a fundamental factor that incurs majority-class dominance and minority-class assimilation in GNNs. Our theoretical analysis further supports this critical insight. Therefore, we propose GraphSB (Graph Structural Balance), a novel framework that incorporates Structural Balance as a key strategy to address the underlying imbalanced graph structure before node synthesis. Structural Balance performs a two-stage structure optimization: Structure Enhancement that adaptively builds similarity-based edges to strengthen connectivity of minority-class nodes, and Relation Diffusion that captures higher-order dependencies while amplifying signals from minority classes. Thus, GraphSB balances structural distribution before node synthesis, enabling more effective learning in GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphSB significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, the proposed Structural Balance can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art methods as a simple plug-and-play module, increasing their accuracy by an average of 3.67\%.

*Noam Koren,Ralf J. J. Mackenbach,Ruud J. G. van Sloun,Kira Radinsky,Daniel Freedman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SVD-NO is a neural operator that parameterizes kernel integral operators using singular value decomposition, achieving state-of-the-art performance on PDE benchmarks with improved expressivity and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural operators make strong structural assumptions about kernel integral operators that may limit their expressivity, particularly for PDEs with highly spatially variable solutions.

Method: Parameterizes the kernel using SVD with two lightweight networks learning singular functions, a diagonal matrix for singular values, and Gram-matrix regularization for orthonormality.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on five diverse benchmark equations, with particularly strong gains on PDEs with highly spatially variable solutions.

Conclusion: SVD-NO provides a more expressive and practical neural operator framework that approximates full kernels while maintaining reasonable computational complexity through low-rank structure.

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as a promising paradigm for learning solution operators of partial differential equa- tions (PDEs) directly from data. Existing methods, such as those based on Fourier or graph techniques, make strong as- sumptions about the structure of the kernel integral opera- tor, assumptions which may limit expressivity. We present SVD-NO, a neural operator that explicitly parameterizes the kernel by its singular-value decomposition (SVD) and then carries out the integral directly in the low-rank basis. Two lightweight networks learn the left and right singular func- tions, a diagonal parameter matrix learns the singular values, and a Gram-matrix regularizer enforces orthonormality. As SVD-NO approximates the full kernel, it obtains a high de- gree of expressivity. Furthermore, due to its low-rank struc- ture the computational complexity of applying the operator remains reasonable, leading to a practical system. In exten- sive evaluations on five diverse benchmark equations, SVD- NO achieves a new state of the art. In particular, SVD-NO provides greater performance gains on PDEs whose solutions are highly spatially variable. The code of this work is publicly available at https://github.com/2noamk/SVDNO.git.

*Ruichu Cai,Xiaokai Huang,Wei Chen,Zijian Li,Zhifeng Hao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a temporal latent variable structural causal model to infer causal relationships from data with external interferences, incorporating causal strength and adjacency coefficients, with a variational inference method that allows integration of expert prior knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal inference from observed data is challenging when data is subject to unknown external interferences and unobserved factors, requiring methods to handle latent variables and incorporate expert knowledge.

Method: Developed a temporal latent variable structural causal model with causal strength and adjacency coefficients, using variational inference for parameter learning that can incorporate prior expert knowledge about unknown interferences.

Result: Experimental results show the proposed method achieves stable and accurate causal relationship inference from data with external interferences.

Conclusion: The temporal latent variable structural causal model with variational inference effectively handles external interferences in causal inference and benefits from incorporating expert prior knowledge.

Abstract: Inferring causal relationships from observed data is an important task, yet it becomes challenging when the data is subject to various external interferences. Most of these interferences are the additional effects of external factors on observed variables. Since these external factors are often unknown, we introduce latent variables to represent these unobserved factors that affect the observed data. Specifically, to capture the causal strength and adjacency information, we propose a new temporal latent variable structural causal model, incorporating causal strength and adjacency coefficients that represent the causal relationships between variables. Considering that expert knowledge can provide information about unknown interferences in certain scenarios, we develop a method that facilitates the incorporation of prior knowledge into parameter learning based on Variational Inference, to guide the model estimation. Experimental results demonstrate the stability and accuracy of our proposed method.

### [219] [BuddyMoE: Exploiting Expert Redundancy to Accelerate Memory-Constrained Mixture-of-Experts Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10054)
*Yun Wang,Lingyun Yang,Senhao Yu,Yixiao Wang,Ruixing Li,Zhixiang Wei,James Yen,Zhengwei Qi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoE models face memory constraints requiring expert offloading to CPU, but prefetching failures cause latency stalls or accuracy degradation. The paper addresses maintaining both speed and accuracy when prefetching fails.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern MoE models exceed GPU memory capacity, requiring expert offloading to CPU. Prefetching heuristics aim to hide PCIe transfer latency but failures cause either long stalls or accuracy loss, creating a need for solutions that preserve both inference speed and model quality.

Method: Not specified in the abstract, but the paper appears to propose a solution for handling prefetching failures in MoE architectures that maintains both inference speed and model accuracy.

Result: Not specified in the abstract, but the paper likely presents results showing improved performance and maintained accuracy compared to existing approaches that either stall or drop experts.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that addressing prefetching failures is critical for MoE model deployment, and likely presents a method that successfully balances inference speed and accuracy when prefetching predictions fail.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures scale language models by activating only a subset of specialized expert networks for each input token, thereby reducing the number of floating-point operations. However, the growing size of modern MoE models causes their full parameter sets to exceed GPU memory capacity; for example, Mixtral-8x7B has 45 billion parameters and requires 87 GB of memory even though only 14 billion parameters are used per token. Existing systems alleviate this limitation by offloading inactive experts to CPU memory, but transferring experts across the PCIe interconnect incurs significant latency (about 10 ms). Prefetching heuristics aim to hide this latency by predicting which experts are needed, but prefetch failures introduce significant stalls and amplify inference latency. In the event of a prefetch failure, prior work offers two primary solutions: either fetch the expert on demand, which incurs a long stall due to the PCIe bottleneck, or drop the expert from the computation, which significantly degrades model accuracy. The critical challenge, therefore, is to maintain both high inference speed and model accuracy when prefetching fails.

*Zijing Liu,Bin Feng,He Cao,Yu Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Protein structure tokenization enables sequence-structure integration, but discrete representations have semantic redundancy. This redundancy can be exploited via 'synonym swap' to generate diverse conformational ensembles for modeling protein dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the properties of discrete protein structure representations and leverage semantic redundancy in structural tokens for modeling protein flexibility.

Method: Use pre-trained sequence embeddings to bridge sequence-structure gap, analyze structural vocabulary for semantic redundancy, and develop 'synonym swap' strategy to perturb structures with structural synonyms.

Result: The synonym swap method accurately recapitulates protein flexibility and performs competitively with state-of-the-art models for modeling protein dynamics.

Conclusion: Semantic redundancy in structural tokens is not a flaw but can be exploited for efficient conformational ensemble generation, providing a powerful near-instantaneous method for protein dynamics modeling.

Abstract: Protein structure tokenization converts 3D structures into discrete or vectorized representations, enabling the integration of structural and sequence data. Despite many recent works on structure tokenization, the properties of the underlying discrete representations are not well understood. In this work, we first demonstrate that the successful utilization of structural tokens in a language model for structure prediction depends on using rich, pre-trained sequence embeddings to bridge the semantic gap between the sequence and structural "language". The analysis of the structural vocabulary itself then reveals significant semantic redundancy, where multiple distinct tokens correspond to nearly identical local geometries, acting as "structural synonyms". This redundancy, rather than being a flaw, can be exploited with a simple "synonym swap" strategy to generate diverse conformational ensembles by perturbing a predicted structure with its structural synonyms. This computationally lightweight method accurately recapitulates protein flexibility, performing competitively with state-of-the-art models. Our study provides fundamental insights into the nature of discrete protein structure representations and introduces a powerful, near-instantaneous method for modeling protein dynamics.

TL;DR: FAQNAS is a FLOPs-aware neural architecture search framework for hybrid quantum neural networks that optimizes both accuracy and computational complexity, showing quantum FLOPs dominate accuracy improvements while classical FLOPs remain stable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hybrid quantum neural networks are promising in the NISQ era but are typically trained on classical simulators where FLOPs directly impact runtime and scalability, making FLOPs a practical complexity metric.

Method: FAQNAS formulates HQNN design as multi-objective optimization balancing accuracy and FLOPs, explicitly incorporating FLOPs into the optimization objective to discover efficient architectures.

Result: Experiments on five benchmark datasets show quantum FLOPs dominate accuracy improvements while classical FLOPs remain largely fixed, with Pareto-optimal solutions achieving competitive accuracy at significantly reduced computational cost.

Conclusion: FLOPs-awareness is established as a practical criterion for HQNN design in the NISQ era and as a scalable principle for future HQNN systems.

Abstract: Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (HQNNs), which combine parameterized quantum circuits with classical neural layers, are emerging as promising models in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. While quantum circuits are not naturally measured in floating point operations (FLOPs), most HQNNs (in NISQ era) are still trained on classical simulators where FLOPs directly dictate runtime and scalability. Hence, FLOPs represent a practical and viable metric to measure the computational complexity of HQNNs. In this work, we introduce FAQNAS, a FLOPs-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework that formulates HQNN design as a multi-objective optimization problem balancing accuracy and FLOPs. Unlike traditional approaches, FAQNAS explicitly incorporates FLOPs into the optimization objective, enabling the discovery of architectures that achieve strong performance while minimizing computational cost. Experiments on five benchmark datasets (MNIST, Digits, Wine, Breast Cancer, and Iris) show that quantum FLOPs dominate accuracy improvements, while classical FLOPs remain largely fixed. Pareto-optimal solutions reveal that competitive accuracy can often be achieved with significantly reduced computational cost compared to FLOPs-agnostic baselines. Our results establish FLOPs-awareness as a practical criterion for HQNN design in the NISQ era and as a scalable principle for future HQNN systems.

*Shuxin Zhuang,Linjian Meng,Shuxin Li,Minming Li,Youzhi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TSO is a novel framework that uses tree-based action representation and stochastic optimization to efficiently find Nash Equilibria in large-scale Urban Network Security Games, overcoming limitations of traditional methods like PSRO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for finding Nash Equilibria in Urban Network Security Games face challenges due to massive combinatorial action spaces - PSRO requires impractical exact best responses, while neural networks struggle to represent vast action spaces.

Method: Proposes Tree-based Stochastic Optimization (TSO) that maps the action space onto a tree structure and incorporates this representation into the loss function. Also introduces a sample-and-prune mechanism to avoid local optima.

Result: Extensive experiments show TSO outperforms baseline algorithms in solving Urban Network Security Games, demonstrating superior performance in finding Nash Equilibria.

Conclusion: TSO effectively bridges the gap between stochastic optimization and the demands of UNSGs, providing a practical solution for large-scale security resource allocation problems with massive action spaces.

Abstract: Urban Network Security Games (UNSGs), which model the strategic allocation of limited security resources on city road networks, are critical for urban safety. However, finding a Nash Equilibrium (NE) in large-scale UNSGs is challenging due to their massive and combinatorial action spaces. One common approach to addressing these games is the Policy-Space Response Oracle (PSRO) framework, which requires computing best responses (BR) at each iteration. However, precisely computing exact BRs is impractical in large-scale games, and employing reinforcement learning to approximate BRs inevitably introduces errors, which limits the overall effectiveness of the PSRO methods. Recent advancements in leveraging non-convex stochastic optimization to approximate an NE offer a promising alternative to the burdensome BR computation. However, utilizing existing stochastic optimization techniques with an unbiased loss function for UNSGs remains challenging because the action spaces are too vast to be effectively represented by neural networks. To address these issues, we introduce Tree-based Stochastic Optimization (TSO), a framework that bridges the gap between the stochastic optimization paradigm for NE-finding and the demands of UNSGs. Specifically, we employ the tree-based action representation that maps the whole action space onto a tree structure, addressing the challenge faced by neural networks in representing actions when the action space cannot be enumerated. We then incorporate this representation into the loss function and theoretically demonstrate its equivalence to the unbiased loss function. To further enhance the quality of the converged solution, we introduce a sample-and-prune mechanism that reduces the risk of being trapped in suboptimal local optima. Extensive experimental results indicate the superiority of TSO over other baseline algorithms in addressing the UNSGs.

*Leonardo Pesce,Jiawen Wei,Gianmarco Mengaldo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new black-box adversarial attack method that manipulates post-hoc XAI explanations without changing model predictions, requiring only access to predictions and explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose vulnerabilities in current explainability methods by showing how explanations can be manipulated while maintaining the same predicted class and being visually undetectable.

Method: Single-step black-box attack using only model predictions and explanations (saliency maps, integrated gradients, DeepLIFT SHAP) without requiring model weights or architecture access.

Result: Successfully generated dramatically different explanations without changing predictive probabilities, validated using mean absolute difference and SSIM metrics.

Conclusion: Current explainability methods have critical vulnerabilities that raise concerns about their reliability in safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Post-hoc explainability methods are a subset of Machine Learning (ML) that aim to provide a reason for why a model behaves in a certain way. In this paper, we show a new black-box model-agnostic adversarial attack for post-hoc explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), particularly in the image domain. The goal of the attack is to modify the original explanations while being undetected by the human eye and maintain the same predicted class. In contrast to previous methods, we do not require any access to the model or its weights, but only to the model's computed predictions and explanations. Additionally, the attack is accomplished in a single step while significantly changing the provided explanations, as demonstrated by empirical evaluation. The low requirements of our method expose a critical vulnerability in current explainability methods, raising concerns about their reliability in safety-critical applications. We systematically generate attacks based on the explanations generated by post-hoc explainability methods (saliency maps, integrated gradients, and DeepLIFT SHAP) for pretrained ResNet-18 and ViT-B16 on ImageNet. The results show that our attacks could lead to dramatically different explanations without changing the predictive probabilities. We validate the effectiveness of our attack, compute the induced change based on the explanation with mean absolute difference, and verify the closeness of the original image and the corrupted one with the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM).

TL;DR: Study shows text-to-image models systematically encode and amplify societal biases, with caregiving roles feminized and high-status professions dominated by white males across five popular models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether societal biases regarding race and gender are systematically encoded in pretrained latent spaces of state-of-the-art text-to-image models, addressing responsible AI concerns.

Method: Empirical study across five popular open-source T2I models using ten neutral profession-related prompts, generating 100 images per profession (5,000 total), evaluated by diverse human assessors of different races and genders.

Result: All five models encode pronounced societal biases: caregiving roles consistently feminized, high-status professions (CEO, politician, doctor, lawyer) overwhelmingly represented by males and mostly White individuals, with model-specific patterns like QWEN-Image's East Asian focus and Kandinsky's White dominance.

Conclusion: Findings provide critical insights for selecting equitable AI models and developing bias mitigation strategies to build responsible GenAI systems aligned with organizational ethics.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generative models are largely used in AI-powered real-world applications and value creation. However, their strategic deployment raises critical concerns for responsible AI management, particularly regarding the reproduction and amplification of race- and gender-related stereotypes that can undermine organizational ethics. In this work, we investigate whether such societal biases are systematically encoded within the pretrained latent spaces of state-of-the-art T2I models. We conduct an empirical study across the five most popular open-source models, using ten neutral, profession-related prompts to generate 100 images per profession, resulting in a dataset of 5,000 images evaluated by diverse human assessors representing different races and genders. We demonstrate that all five models encode and amplify pronounced societal skew: caregiving and nursing roles are consistently feminized, while high-status professions such as corporate CEO, politician, doctor, and lawyer are overwhelmingly represented by males and mostly White individuals. We further identify model-specific patterns, such as QWEN-Image's near-exclusive focus on East Asian outputs, Kandinsky's dominance of White individuals, and SDXL's comparatively broader but still biased distributions. These results provide critical insights for AI project managers and practitioners, enabling them to select equitable AI models and customized prompts that generate images in alignment with the principles of responsible AI. We conclude by discussing the risks of these biases and proposing actionable strategies for bias mitigation in building responsible GenAI systems.

TL;DR: Matryoshka Transcoders is a framework that automatically discovers and interprets physical plausibility failures in generative models using hierarchical sparse feature learning and multimodal model interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models often produce physically implausible outputs that escape detection by existing evaluation methods, and there's no framework for automatically identifying specific physical error patterns to enable targeted improvements.

Method: Extends Matryoshka representation learning to transcoder architectures for hierarchical sparse feature learning at multiple granularity levels, training on intermediate representations from physical plausibility classifiers and using large multimodal models for interpretation.

Result: Achieves superior feature relevance and accuracy compared to existing approaches, identifies diverse physics-related failure modes without manual feature engineering, and establishes a benchmark for evaluating physical plausibility in generative models.

Conclusion: The framework provides valuable insights into how state-of-the-art generative models fail to follow physical constraints, enabling targeted improvements and better evaluation of physical plausibility.

Abstract: Although recent generative models are remarkably capable of producing instruction-following and realistic outputs, they remain prone to notable physical plausibility failures. Though critical in applications, these physical plausibility errors often escape detection by existing evaluation methods. Furthermore, no framework exists for automatically identifying and interpreting specific physical error patterns in natural language, preventing targeted model improvements. We introduce Matryoshka Transcoders, a novel framework for the automatic discovery and interpretation of physical plausibility features in generative models. Our approach extends the Matryoshka representation learning paradigm to transcoder architectures, enabling hierarchical sparse feature learning at multiple granularity levels. By training on intermediate representations from a physical plausibility classifier and leveraging large multimodal models for interpretation, our method identifies diverse physics-related failure modes without manual feature engineering, achieving superior feature relevance and feature accuracy compared to existing approaches. We utilize the discovered visual patterns to establish a benchmark for evaluating physical plausibility in generative models. Our analysis of eight state-of-the-art generative models provides valuable insights into how these models fail to follow physical constraints, paving the way for further model improvements.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RI-Loss, a novel HSIC-based objective function that models noise structure in time series forecasting, overcoming MSE limitations by capturing temporal relationships and accounting for inherent data noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art time series forecasting models use MSE loss, which fails to capture temporal relationships and doesn't account for inherent noise in data, limiting their performance.

Method: Proposed Residual-Informed Loss (RI-Loss) based on Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) that enforces dependence between residual sequence and random time series, with theoretical guarantees including non-asymptotic HSIC bounds and optimal convergence rates.

Result: Experiments across eight real-world benchmarks and five leading forecasting models demonstrate improved predictive performance, validating the effectiveness of RI-Loss.

Conclusion: RI-Loss provides a robust, noise-aware alternative to MSE for time series forecasting, with theoretical guarantees and empirical validation across multiple benchmarks and models.

Abstract: Time series forecasting relies on predicting future values from historical data, yet most state-of-the-art approaches-including transformer and multilayer perceptron-based models-optimize using Mean Squared Error (MSE), which has two fundamental weaknesses: its point-wise error computation fails to capture temporal relationships, and it does not account for inherent noise in the data. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Residual-Informed Loss (RI-Loss), a novel objective function based on the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). RI-Loss explicitly models noise structure by enforcing dependence between the residual sequence and a random time series, enabling more robust, noise-aware representations. Theoretically, we derive the first non-asymptotic HSIC bound with explicit double-sample complexity terms, achieving optimal convergence rates through Bernstein-type concentration inequalities and Rademacher complexity analysis. This provides rigorous guarantees for RI-Loss optimization while precisely quantifying kernel space interactions. Empirically, experiments across eight real-world benchmarks and five leading forecasting models demonstrate improvements in predictive performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach. Code will be made publicly available to ensure reproducibility.

Result: On Tetrapeptides, ATLAS, and Fast-Folding benchmarks, EPO establishes state-of-the-art performance in nine evaluation metrics, generating diverse and physically realistic ensembles.

Conclusion: Energy-only preference signals can efficiently steer generative models toward thermodynamically consistent conformational ensembles, providing an alternative to long MD simulations and expanding the use of learned potentials in structural biology and drug discovery.

Abstract: Accurate exploration of protein conformational ensembles is essential for uncovering function but remains hard because molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations suffer from high computational costs and energy-barrier trapping. This paper presents Energy Preference Optimization (EPO), an online refinement algorithm that turns a pretrained protein ensemble generator into an energy-aware sampler without extra MD trajectories. Specifically, EPO leverages stochastic differential equation sampling to explore the conformational landscape and incorporates a novel energy-ranking mechanism based on list-wise preference optimization. Crucially, EPO introduces a practical upper bound to efficiently approximate the intractable probability of long sampling trajectories in continuous-time generative models, making it easily adaptable to existing pretrained generators. On Tetrapeptides, ATLAS, and Fast-Folding benchmarks, EPO successfully generates diverse and physically realistic ensembles, establishing a new state-of-the-art in nine evaluation metrics. These results demonstrate that energy-only preference signals can efficiently steer generative models toward thermodynamically consistent conformational ensembles, providing an alternative to long MD simulations and widening the applicability of learned potentials in structural biology and drug discovery.

TL;DR: Quantum Metric Encoder (QME) improves offline RL performance with limited samples by embedding states into quantum-inspired representations, achieving ~117% improvement over original states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL with limited samples often performs poorly, so the authors seek an alternative approach using quantum-inspired embeddings to create more compact and meaningful state representations.

Method: Introduces QME - a quantum-inspired embedding method that can be classically simulated for classical data or implemented on quantum hardware for quantum data. Evaluated with SAC and IQL RL algorithms on 100-sample datasets.

Result: Training RL agents on QME-embedded states with decoded rewards yields significantly better performance - 116.2% improvement for SAC and 117.6% for IQL on average across three datasets.

Conclusion: QME improves offline RL by modifying state space geometry to exhibit low Δ-hyperbolicity, providing valuable insights for developing efficient limited-sample RL methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with limited samples is common in real-world applications. However, offline RL performance under this constraint is often suboptimal. We consider an alternative approach to dealing with limited samples by introducing the Quantum Metric Encoder (QME). In this methodology, instead of applying the RL framework directly on the original states and rewards, we embed the states into a more compact and meaningful representation, where the structure of the encoding is inspired by quantum circuits. For classical data, QME is a classically simulable, trainable unitary embedding and thus serves as a quantum-inspired module, on a classical device. For quantum data in the form of quantum states, QME can be implemented directly on quantum hardware, allowing for training without measurement or re-encoding.
  We evaluated QME on three datasets, each limited to 100 samples. We use Soft-Actor-Critic (SAC) and Implicit-Q-Learning (IQL), two well-known RL algorithms, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. From the experimental results, we find that training offline RL agents on QME-embedded states with decoded rewards yields significantly better performance than training on the original states and rewards. On average across the three datasets, for maximum reward performance, we achieve a 116.2% improvement for SAC and 117.6% for IQL.
  We further investigate the $Δ$-hyperbolicity of our framework, a geometric property of the state space known to be important for the RL training efficacy. The QME-embedded states exhibit low $Δ$-hyperbolicity, suggesting that the improvement after embedding arises from the modified geometry of the state space induced by QME. Thus, the low $Δ$-hyperbolicity and the corresponding effectiveness of QME could provide valuable information for developing efficient offline RL methods under limited-sample conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most bioacoustics studies average frame-level features across time, discarding sequential structure that carries important communicative information in animal vocalizations. The paper aims to leverage temporal information through discrete token sequences.

Method: Used vector quantization and gumbel-softmax vector quantization of HuBERT embeddings to create discrete acoustic token sequences. Evaluated through pairwise distance analysis and sequence classification using k-Nearest Neighbour with Levenshtein distance.

Result: Token sequences effectively discriminated call-types and callers across four bioacoustics datasets. Vector-quantized token sequences yielded reasonable classification performance for both call-type and caller identification.

Conclusion: Discrete acoustic token sequences show promise as alternative feature representations for leveraging sequential information in animal vocalizations, offering a way to preserve and utilize temporal structure in bioacoustics analysis.

Abstract: Animal vocalizations contain sequential structures that carry important communicative information, yet most computational bioacoustics studies average the extracted frame-level features across the temporal axis, discarding the order of the sub-units within a vocalization. This paper investigates whether discrete acoustic token sequences, derived through vector quantization and gumbel-softmax vector quantization of extracted self-supervised speech model representations can effectively capture and leverage temporal information. To that end, pairwise distance analysis of token sequences generated from HuBERT embeddings shows that they can discriminate call-types and callers across four bioacoustics datasets. Sequence classification experiments using $k$-Nearest Neighbour with Levenshtein distance show that the vector-quantized token sequences yield reasonable call-type and caller classification performances, and hold promise as alternative feature representations towards leveraging sequential information in animal vocalizations.

*Jieting Wang,Huimei Shi,Feijiang Li,Xiaolei Shang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OCE-TS is a novel ordinal classification approach for time series forecasting that replaces MSE loss with Ordinal Cross-Entropy loss, providing uncertainty estimation and improved outlier robustness while outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning forecasting models using MSE loss lack uncertainty estimation and exhibit poor outlier robustness, limiting their practical applicability in real-world scenarios.

Method: OCE-TS discretizes observed values into ordered intervals, derives probabilities via parametric distribution, predicts probability distributions using linear models, and computes OCE loss between cumulative distributions to preserve ordinal relationships.

Result: OCE-TS consistently outperformed five baseline models (Autoformer, DLinear, iTransformer, TimeXer, TimeBridge) on seven public datasets using MSE and MAE metrics, demonstrating superior performance.

Conclusion: The proposed OCE-TS approach effectively addresses limitations of MSE-based forecasting by providing uncertainty quantification and improved outlier robustness while achieving state-of-the-art performance through ordinal classification.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is an important task that involves analyzing temporal dependencies and underlying patterns (such as trends, cyclicality, and seasonality) in historical data to predict future values or trends. Current deep learning-based forecasting models primarily employ Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss functions for regression modeling. Despite enabling direct value prediction, this method offers no uncertainty estimation and exhibits poor outlier robustness. To address these limitations, we propose OCE-TS, a novel ordinal classification approach for time series forecasting that replaces MSE with Ordinal Cross-Entropy (OCE) loss, preserving prediction order while quantifying uncertainty through probability output. Specifically, OCE-TS begins by discretizing observed values into ordered intervals and deriving their probabilities via a parametric distribution as supervision signals. Using a simple linear model, we then predict probability distributions for each timestep. The OCE loss is computed between the cumulative distributions of predicted and ground-truth probabilities, explicitly preserving ordinal relationships among forecasted values. Through theoretical analysis using influence functions, we establish that cross-entropy (CE) loss exhibits superior stability and outlier robustness compared to MSE loss. Empirically, we compared OCE-TS with five baseline models-Autoformer, DLinear, iTransformer, TimeXer, and TimeBridge-on seven public time series datasets. Using MSE and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as evaluation metrics, the results demonstrate that OCE-TS consistently outperforms benchmark models. The code will be published.

TL;DR: FNA is a neuroscience-inspired attention mechanism using fractional Laplacian for multiscale token interactions, achieving competitive performance with enhanced computational efficiency and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance Transformer models by understanding and extending self-attention principles through biological attention dynamics and dynamical systems theory.

Method: Models token interactions via Lévy diffusion governed by fractional Laplacian, enabling simultaneous short- and long-range dependencies across multiple scales.

Result: Achieves competitive text-classification with single layer/head, improves image processing and machine translation performance, and enables dimensionality reduction preserving embedding structure.

Conclusion: FNA establishes a principled connection between self-attention, stochastic dynamics, and geometry, providing an interpretable, biologically grounded foundation for neuroscience-inspired AI.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms underpin the computational power of Transformer models, which have achieved remarkable success across diverse domains. Yet understanding and extending the principles underlying self-attention remains a key challenge for advancing artificial intelligence. Drawing inspiration from the multiscale dynamics of biological attention and from dynamical systems theory, we introduce Fractional Neural Attention (FNA), a principled, neuroscience-inspired framework for multiscale information processing. FNA models token interactions through Lévy diffusion governed by the fractional Laplacian, intrinsically realizing simultaneous short- and long-range dependencies across multiple scales. This mechanism yields greater expressivity and faster information mixing, advancing the foundational capacity of Transformers. Theoretically, we show that FNA's dynamics are governed by the fractional diffusion equation, and that the resulting attention networks exhibit larger spectral gaps and shorter path lengths -- mechanistic signatures of enhanced computational efficiency. Empirically, FNA achieves competitive text-classification performance even with a single layer and a single head; it also improves performance in image processing and neural machine translation. Finally, the diffusion map algorithm from geometric harmonics enables dimensionality reduction of FNA weights while preserving the intrinsic structure of embeddings and hidden states. Together, these results establish FNA as a principled mechanism connecting self-attention, stochastic dynamics, and geometry, providing an interpretable, biologically grounded foundation for powerful, neuroscience-inspired AI.

*Xi Yang,Han Zhang,Zhijian Lin,Yibiao Hu,Hong Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VDT enhances domain adaptation for out-of-context misinformation detection by learning domain-invariant features and using test-time training to handle novel news domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OOC misinformation detection methods assume same training-test distribution and perform poorly on novel domains due to lack of prior knowledge.

Method: Proposes VDT with Domain-Invariant Variational Align module for joint encoding, domain consistency constraints for semantic preservation, and test-time training with confidence-variance filtering for dynamic adaptation.

Result: Extensive experiments on NewsCLIPpings dataset show VDT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under most domain adaptation settings.

Conclusion: VDT effectively addresses domain adaptation challenges in OOC misinformation detection through domain-invariant feature learning and test-time training mechanisms.

Abstract: Out-of-context misinformation (OOC) is a low-cost form of misinformation in news reports, which refers to place authentic images into out-of-context or fabricated image-text pairings. This problem has attracted significant attention from researchers in recent years. Current methods focus on assessing image-text consistency or generating explanations. However, these approaches assume that the training and test data are drawn from the same distribution. When encountering novel news domains, models tend to perform poorly due to the lack of prior knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{VDT} to enhance the domain adaptation capability for OOC misinformation detection by learning domain-invariant features and test-time training mechanisms. Domain-Invariant Variational Align module is employed to jointly encodes source and target domain data to learn a separable distributional space domain-invariant features. For preserving semantic integrity, we utilize domain consistency constraint module to reconstruct the source and target domain latent distribution. During testing phase, we adopt the test-time training strategy and confidence-variance filtering module to dynamically updating the VAE encoder and classifier, facilitating the model's adaptation to the target domain distribution. Extensive experiments conducted on the benchmark dataset NewsCLIPpings demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under most domain adaptation settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedCure is a semi-asynchronous federated learning framework that addresses participation bias and non-IID data issues in hierarchical architectures through coalition construction and participation-aware scheduling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semi-asynchronous federated learning suffers from participation bias exacerbated by non-IID data, and hierarchical architectures intensify this issue by shifting participation to client groups. Existing works overlook the impact of non-IID data on scheduling across cloud-edge-client hierarchies.

Method: FedCure uses three key rules: (1) preference rule for coalition formation to maximize collective benefits and establish stable partitions; (2) scheduling rule integrating virtual queue technique with Bayesian-estimated coalition dynamics; (3) resource allocation rule optimizing client CPU frequencies based on coalition dynamics while satisfying delay requirements.

Result: Experiments on four real-world datasets show FedCure improves accuracy by up to 5.1x compared to state-of-the-art baselines, achieves lowest coefficient of variation (0.0223) for per-round latency, and maintains long-term balance across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: FedCure effectively mitigates participation bias in semi-asynchronous federated learning with non-IID data through coalition-based optimization and dynamic scheduling, significantly improving both accuracy and efficiency while maintaining system stability.

Abstract: While semi-asynchronous federated learning (SAFL) combines the efficiency of synchronous training with the flexibility of asynchronous updates, it inherently suffers from participation bias, which is further exacerbated by non-IID data distributions. More importantly, hierarchical architecture shifts participation from individual clients to client groups, thereby further intensifying this issue. Despite notable advancements in SAFL research, most existing works still focus on conventional cloud-end architectures while largely overlooking the critical impact of non-IID data on scheduling across the cloud-edge-client hierarchy. To tackle these challenges, we propose FedCure, an innovative semi-asynchronous Federated learning framework that leverages coalition construction and participation-aware scheduling to mitigate participation bias with non-IID data. Specifically, FedCure operates through three key rules: (1) a preference rule that optimizes coalition formation by maximizing collective benefits and establishing theoretically stable partitions to reduce non-IID-induced performance degradation; (2) a scheduling rule that integrates the virtual queue technique with Bayesian-estimated coalition dynamics, mitigating efficiency loss while ensuring mean rate stability; and (3) a resource allocation rule that enhances computational efficiency by optimizing client CPU frequencies based on estimated coalition dynamics while satisfying delay requirements. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FedCure improves accuracy by up to 5.1x compared with four state-of-the-art baselines, while significantly enhancing efficiency with the lowest coefficient of variation 0.0223 for per-round latency and maintaining long-term balance across diverse scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM-based graph reasoners lack invariance to graph symmetries, causing robustness issues. Fine-tuning reduces sensitivity to node relabeling but may increase sensitivity to structural and formatting changes, without consistently improving performance on unseen tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph reasoners using LLMs are sensitive to graph representation symmetries (node reindexing, edge reordering, formatting changes), raising robustness concerns that need systematic analysis.

Method: Proposed decomposition of graph serializations into node labeling, edge encoding, and syntax; evaluated LLM robustness to variations in each factor using comprehensive benchmarking suite and novel spectral tasks.

Result: Larger non-fine-tuned models are more robust. Fine-tuning reduces sensitivity to node relabeling but increases sensitivity to structural and format variations, and doesn't consistently improve performance on unseen tasks.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning LLM-based graph reasoners has mixed effects: it helps with node relabeling robustness but may harm robustness to other graph representation variations and doesn't reliably improve generalization to new tasks.

Abstract: While promising, graph reasoners based on Large Language Models (LLMs) lack built-in invariance to symmetries in graph representations. Operating on sequential graph serializations, LLMs can produce different outputs under node reindexing, edge reordering, or formatting changes, raising robustness concerns. We systematically analyze these effects, studying how fine-tuning impacts encoding sensitivity as well generalization on unseen tasks. We propose a principled decomposition of graph serializations into node labeling, edge encoding, and syntax, and evaluate LLM robustness to variations of each of these factors on a comprehensive benchmarking suite. We also contribute a novel set of spectral tasks to further assess generalization abilities of fine-tuned reasoners. Results show that larger (non-fine-tuned) models are more robust. Fine-tuning reduces sensitivity to node relabeling but may increase it to variations in structure and format, while it does not consistently improve performance on unseen tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance transformer-based sequential decision-making by bridging belief-based augmentations with in-context learning capabilities, enabling better task adaptation without parameter updates.

Method: Uses a variational auto-encoder to learn low-dimensional stochastic variables representing posterior reward distributions, which are incorporated alongside in-context datasets and query states as prompts to the transformer policy.

Result: HT consistently surpasses comparable baselines in effectiveness and generalization across Darkroom, Miniworld, and MuJoCo environments.

Conclusion: The method presents a promising direction for integrating belief-based augmentations with transformer-based decision-making in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated exceptional in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, enabling applications across natural language processing, computer vision, and sequential decision-making. In reinforcement learning, ICL reframes learning as a supervised problem, facilitating task adaptation without parameter updates. Building on prior work leveraging transformers for sequential decision-making, we propose Heuristic Transformer (HT), an in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) approach that augments the in-context dataset with a belief distribution over rewards to achieve better decision-making. Using a variational auto-encoder (VAE), a low-dimensional stochastic variable is learned to represent the posterior distribution over rewards, which is incorporated alongside an in-context dataset and query states as prompt to the transformer policy. We assess the performance of HT across the Darkroom, Miniworld, and MuJoCo environments, showing that it consistently surpasses comparable baselines in terms of both effectiveness and generalization. Our method presents a promising direction to bridge the gap between belief-based augmentations and transformer-based decision-making.

Conclusion: Torch-Uncertainty bridges the gap by providing a unified framework for uncertainty quantification in deep learning, available as an open-source library.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains, including computer vision and natural language processing.

TL;DR: OutSafe-Bench is a comprehensive multimodal safety evaluation benchmark with 18K+ bilingual prompts, 4.5K images, 450 audio clips, and 450 videos across 9 risk categories, introducing MCRS metric and FairScore framework for robust assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing concerns about MLLMs outputting unsafe content (toxic language, biased imagery, privacy violations, misinformation) and limitations of current safety benchmarks in modality coverage and performance evaluations.

Method: Created OutSafe-Bench with large-scale multimodal dataset, introduced Multidimensional Cross Risk Score (MCRS) for overlapping risk assessment, and developed FairScore framework using top-performing models as adaptive juries for unbiased evaluation.

Result: Evaluation of 9 state-of-the-art MLLMs revealed persistent and substantial safety vulnerabilities, highlighting the urgent need for robust safety measures.

Conclusion: MLLMs have significant safety gaps that require immediate attention and development of comprehensive safeguards to prevent harmful content generation.

Abstract: Since Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly being integrated into everyday tools and intelligent agents, growing concerns have arisen regarding their possible output of unsafe contents, ranging from toxic language and biased imagery to privacy violations and harmful misinformation. Current safety benchmarks remain highly limited in both modality coverage and performance evaluations, often neglecting the extensive landscape of content safety. In this work, we introduce OutSafe-Bench, the first most comprehensive content safety evaluation test suite designed for the multimodal era. OutSafe-Bench includes a large-scale dataset that spans four modalities, featuring over 18,000 bilingual (Chinese and English) text prompts, 4,500 images, 450 audio clips and 450 videos, all systematically annotated across nine critical content risk categories. In addition to the dataset, we introduce a Multidimensional Cross Risk Score (MCRS), a novel metric designed to model and assess overlapping and correlated content risks across different categories. To ensure fair and robust evaluation, we propose FairScore, an explainable automated multi-reviewer weighted aggregation framework. FairScore selects top-performing models as adaptive juries, thereby mitigating biases from single-model judgments and enhancing overall evaluation reliability. Our evaluation of nine state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals persistent and substantial safety vulnerabilities, underscoring the pressing need for robust safeguards in MLLMs.

TL;DR: PITE is a multi-prototype alignment method for individual treatment effect estimation that captures local structure within groups and performs cross-group alignment to reduce distribution shift while preserving local clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for ITE estimation either balance distributions globally (ignoring individual heterogeneity) or use instance-level alignment (overlooking local structure), both compromising accurate ITE estimation.

Method: Define prototypes as cluster centroids for similar individuals under same treatment, perform instance-to-prototype matching within groups, and use multi-prototype alignment to bring matched prototypes closer across treatment arms in latent space.

Result: Extensive evaluations show PITE outperforms 13 state-of-the-art methods, achieving more accurate and robust ITE estimation on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: PITE effectively addresses confounding bias by capturing local structure and performing fine-grained prototype-level alignment, providing meaningful constraints for robust ITE estimation.

Abstract: Estimating Individual Treatment Effects (ITE) from observational data is challenging due to confounding bias. Most studies tackle this bias by balancing distributions globally, but ignore individual heterogeneity and fail to capture the local structure that represents the natural clustering among individuals, which ultimately compromises ITE estimation. While instance-level alignment methods consider heterogeneity, they similarly overlook the local structure information. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end Multi-\textbf{P}rototype alignment method for \textbf{ITE} estimation (\textbf{PITE}). PITE effectively captures local structure within groups and enforces cross-group alignment, thereby achieving robust ITE estimation. Specifically, we first define prototypes as cluster centroids based on similar individuals under the same treatment. To identify local similarity and the distribution consistency, we perform instance-to-prototype matching to assign individuals to the nearest prototype within groups, and design a multi-prototype alignment strategy to encourage the matched prototypes to be close across treatment arms in the latent space. PITE not only reduces distribution shift through fine-grained, prototype-level alignment, but also preserves the local structures of treated and control groups, which provides meaningful constraints for ITE estimation. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PITE outperforms 13 state-of-the-art methods, achieving more accurate and robust ITE estimation.

TL;DR: EDGC is an entropy-driven dynamic gradient compression framework that adapts compression rates during LLM training based on gradient entropy trends, reducing communication overhead while maintaining model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training large language models faces computational and memory challenges, with distributed training suffering from communication overhead. Static gradient compression methods neglect the dynamic nature of evolving gradients, leading to performance degradation.

Method: EDGC uses three components: down-sampling for efficient gradient entropy estimation, a theoretical model linking compression rate with gradient entropy, and a window-based adjustment mechanism that dynamically adapts compression rates across pipeline stages.

Result: Implemented on 32-NVIDIA-V100 and 64-NVIDIA-H100 clusters training GPT2-2.5B and GPT2-12.1B, EDGC reduced communication latency by up to 46.45% and training time by 16.13% while preserving LLM accuracy.

Conclusion: EDGC successfully addresses the challenge of accelerating LLM training through dynamic gradient compression that adapts to evolving gradient characteristics, achieving significant communication efficiency gains without sacrificing model performance.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) poses significant challenges regarding computational resources and memory capacity. Although distributed training techniques help mitigate these issues, they still suffer from considerable communication overhead. Existing approaches primarily rely on static gradient compression to enhance communication efficiency; however, these methods neglect the dynamic nature of evolving gradients during training, leading to performance degradation. Accelerating LLM training via compression without sacrificing performance remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose an entropy-driven dynamic gradient compression framework called EDGC. The core concept is to adjust the compression rate during LLM training based on the evolving trends of gradient entropy, taking into account both compression efficiency and error. EDGC consists of three key components.First, it employs a down-sampling method to efficiently estimate gradient entropy, reducing computation overhead. Second, it establishes a theoretical model linking compression rate with gradient entropy, enabling more informed compression decisions. Lastly, a window-based adjustment mechanism dynamically adapts the compression rate across pipeline stages, improving communication efficiency and maintaining model performance. We implemented EDGC on a 32-NVIDIA-V100 cluster and a 64-NVIDIA-H100 cluster to train GPT2-2.5B and GPT2-12.1B, respectively. The results show that EDGC significantly reduces communication latency and training time by up to 46.45% and 16.13% while preserving LLM accuracy.

TL;DR: DeMABAR is a robust decentralized multi-agent multi-armed bandit algorithm that provides strong protection against adversarial attacks, including corruption of reward observations and Byzantine agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing decentralized cooperative multi-agent multi-armed bandit methods are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, including reward corruption and Byzantine agents who can arbitrarily select arms and communicate wrong information.

Method: Proposed DeMABAR algorithm that handles adversarial corruption with limited budget and can withstand attacks on a small number of agents, providing robustness in Byzantine settings where some agents may be malicious.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows DeMABAR ensures individual regret suffers only an additive term proportional to corruption budget, and can almost completely eliminate influence of adversarial attacks. Numerical experiments confirm robustness and effectiveness.

Conclusion: DeMABAR provides strong robustness guarantees for decentralized multi-agent bandit problems against various adversarial attacks, making it suitable for practical applications where security and reliability are critical.

Abstract: Decentralized cooperative multi-agent multi-armed bandits (DeCMA2B) considers how multiple agents collaborate in a decentralized multi-armed bandit setting. Though this problem has been extensively studied in previous work, most existing methods remain susceptible to various adversarial attacks. In this paper, we first study DeCMA2B with adversarial corruption, where an adversary can corrupt reward observations of all agents with a limited corruption budget. We propose a robust algorithm, called DeMABAR, which ensures that each agent's individual regret suffers only an additive term proportional to the corruption budget. Then we consider a more realistic scenario where the adversary can only attack a small number of agents. Our theoretical analysis shows that the DeMABAR algorithm can also almost completely eliminate the influence of adversarial attacks and is inherently robust in the Byzantine setting, where an unknown fraction of the agents can be Byzantine, i.e., may arbitrarily select arms and communicate wrong information. We also conduct numerical experiments to illustrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the training dynamics and loss landscape of deep linear neural networks without activation functions, particularly the gradient flow behavior and critical point structure.

Method: Analyze gradient flow equations using adjacency matrix representation, study nilpotent polynomial ODEs with isospectral properties, examine loss function as Lyapunov function, and characterize critical points through quotient space structure.

Result: Identified infinitely many global minima and saddle points (both strict and nonstrict), no local minima/maxima. Loss function serves as positive semidefinite Lyapunov function with unbounded invariant level sets. Critical values correspond to learned singular values of input-output data.

Conclusion: The adjacency matrix representation reveals a quotient space structure that uniquely represents critical values and facilitates analysis of stable/unstable manifolds at saddle points, even when Hessian analysis fails.

Abstract: The paper surveys recent progresses in understanding the dynamics and loss landscape of the gradient flow equations associated to deep linear neural networks, i.e., the gradient descent training dynamics (in the limit when the step size goes to 0) of deep neural networks missing the activation functions and subject to quadratic loss functions. When formulated in terms of the adjacency matrix of the neural network, as we do in the paper, these gradient flow equations form a class of converging matrix ODEs which is nilpotent, polynomial, isospectral, and with conservation laws. The loss landscape is described in detail. It is characterized by infinitely many global minima and saddle points, both strict and nonstrict, but lacks local minima and maxima. The loss function itself is a positive semidefinite Lyapunov function for the gradient flow, and its level sets are unbounded invariant sets of critical points, with critical values that correspond to the amount of singular values of the input-output data learnt by the gradient along a certain trajectory. The adjacency matrix representation we use in the paper allows to highlight the existence of a quotient space structure in which each critical value of the loss function is represented only once, while all other critical points with the same critical value belong to the fiber associated to the quotient space. It also allows to easily determine stable and unstable submanifolds at the saddle points, even when the Hessian fails to obtain them.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies distribution learning for product distributions on the Boolean hypercube when given advice distribution parameters, showing improved sample complexity when the mean vectors are close.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard distribution learning for product distributions requires Ω(d/ε²) samples. This work explores whether having access to an advice distribution Q can reduce sample complexity when P and Q are close.

Method: The authors develop an efficient algorithm that uses the advice distribution Q's parameters to learn P. The algorithm works when the L1 distance between mean vectors of P and Q is bounded by εd^(0.5 - Ω(η)).

Result: The algorithm achieves sample complexity Õ(d^(1-η)/ε²), which is significantly better than the standard Ω(d/ε²) when η > 0, provided the mean vectors are sufficiently close.

Conclusion: Access to advice distribution parameters enables substantial improvements in sample complexity for learning product distributions when the target and advice distributions are close in L1 distance of their mean vectors.

Abstract: Given i.i.d.~samples from an unknown distribution $P$, the goal of distribution learning is to recover the parameters of a distribution that is close to $P$. When $P$ belongs to the class of product distributions on the Boolean hypercube $\{0,1\}^d$, it is known that $Ω(d/\varepsilon^2)$ samples are necessary to learn $P$ within total variation (TV) distance $\varepsilon$. We revisit this problem when the learner is also given as advice the parameters of a product distribution $Q$. We show that there is an efficient algorithm to learn $P$ within TV distance $\varepsilon$ that has sample complexity $\tilde{O}(d^{1-η}/\varepsilon^2)$, if $\|\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{q}\|_1 < \varepsilon d^{0.5 - Ω(η)}$. Here, $\mathbf{p}$ and $\mathbf{q}$ are the mean vectors of $P$ and $Q$ respectively, and no bound on $\|\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{q}\|_1$ is known to the algorithm a priori.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational limitations and lack of robustness in kernel power k-means (KPKM) when dealing with large datasets and noisy data.

Method: Proposed RFF-KPKM using random Fourier features for efficient approximation and IP-RFF-MKPKM combining possibilistic and fuzzy memberships for multiple kernel learning.

Result: Achieved superior efficiency and clustering accuracy on large-scale datasets with theoretical guarantees including excess risk bounds and strong consistency.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively overcome KPKM's limitations, providing scalable and robust clustering with solid theoretical foundations.

Abstract: Kernel power $k$-means (KPKM) leverages a family of means to mitigate local minima issues in kernel $k$-means. However, KPKM faces two key limitations: (1) the computational burden of the full kernel matrix restricts its use on extensive data, and (2) the lack of authentic centroid-sample assignment learning reduces its noise robustness. To overcome these challenges, we propose RFF-KPKM, introducing the first approximation theory for applying random Fourier features (RFF) to KPKM. RFF-KPKM employs RFF to generate efficient, low-dimensional feature maps, bypassing the need for the whole kernel matrix. Crucially, we are the first to establish strong theoretical guarantees for this combination: (1) an excess risk bound of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{k^3/n})$, (2) strong consistency with membership values, and (3) a $(1+\varepsilon)$ relative error bound achievable using the RFF of dimension $\mathrm{poly}(\varepsilon^{-1}\log k)$. Furthermore, to improve robustness and the ability to learn multiple kernels, we propose IP-RFF-MKPKM, an improved possibilistic RFF-based multiple kernel power $k$-means. IP-RFF-MKPKM ensures the scalability of MKPKM via RFF and refines cluster assignments by combining the merits of the possibilistic membership and fuzzy membership. Experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate the superior efficiency and clustering accuracy of the proposed methods compared to the state-of-the-art alternatives.

Method: Three synergistic mechanisms: self-questioning for curiosity-driven task generation, self-navigating for efficient exploration through experience reuse and hybrid policy guidance, and self-attributing for enhanced sample efficiency via differentiated rewards.

Result: Preliminary experiments show AgentEvolver achieves more efficient exploration, better sample utilization, and faster adaptation compared to traditional RL-based baselines.

Conclusion: AgentEvolver enables scalable, cost-effective, and continual improvement of agent capabilities by leveraging LLMs' semantic understanding and reasoning in a unified framework.

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have the potential to significantly enhance human productivity by reasoning, using tools, and executing complex tasks in diverse environments. However, current approaches to developing such agents remain costly and inefficient, as they typically require manually constructed task datasets and reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines with extensive random exploration. These limitations lead to prohibitively high data-construction costs, low exploration efficiency, and poor sample utilization. To address these challenges, we present AgentEvolver, a self-evolving agent system that leverages the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to drive autonomous agent learning. AgentEvolver introduces three synergistic mechanisms: (i) self-questioning, which enables curiosity-driven task generation in novel environments, reducing dependence on handcrafted datasets; (ii) self-navigating, which improves exploration efficiency through experience reuse and hybrid policy guidance; and (iii) self-attributing, which enhances sample efficiency by assigning differentiated rewards to trajectory states and actions based on their contribution. By integrating these mechanisms into a unified framework, AgentEvolver enables scalable, cost-effective, and continual improvement of agent capabilities. Preliminary experiments indicate that AgentEvolver achieves more efficient exploration, better sample utilization, and faster adaptation compared to traditional RL-based baselines.

### [246] [Unlocking Dynamic Inter-Client Spatial Dependencies: A Federated Spatio-Temporal Graph Learning Method for Traffic Flow Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10434)
*Feng Wang,Tianxiang Chen,Shuyue Wei,Qian Chu,Yi Zhang,Yifan Sun,Zhiming Zheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedSTGD is a federated learning framework that models dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies in traffic time series using nonlinear computation decomposition and graph node embedding augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world traffic data is distributed across multiple stakeholders, making it challenging to model inter-client spatial dependencies while maintaining data locality. Existing methods focus on static dependencies, ignoring their dynamic nature.

Method: FedSTGD uses federated nonlinear computation decomposition to approximate complex graph operations, graph node embedding augmentation to mitigate performance degradation, and a client-server collective learning protocol to decompose dependency learning into parallel subtasks.

Result: Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show FedSTGD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in RMSE, MAE, and MAPE metrics, approaching centralized baseline performance.

Conclusion: FedSTGD effectively addresses dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies in federated learning settings, with each module contributing to performance improvements and demonstrating robustness to hyperparameter variations.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal graphs are powerful tools for modeling complex dependencies in traffic time series. However, the distributed nature of real-world traffic data across multiple stakeholders poses significant challenges in modeling and reconstructing inter-client spatial dependencies while adhering to data locality constraints. Existing methods primarily address static dependencies, overlooking their dynamic nature and resulting in suboptimal performance. In response, we propose Federated Spatio-Temporal Graph with Dynamic Inter-Client Dependencies (FedSTGD), a framework designed to model and reconstruct dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies in federated learning. FedSTGD incorporates a federated nonlinear computation decomposition module to approximate complex graph operations. This is complemented by a graph node embedding augmentation module, which alleviates performance degradation arising from the decomposition. These modules are coordinated through a client-server collective learning protocol, which decomposes dynamic inter-client spatial dependency learning tasks into lightweight, parallelizable subtasks. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FedSTGD achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of RMSE, MAE, and MAPE, approaching that of centralized baselines. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each module in addressing dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies, while sensitivity analysis highlights the robustness of FedSTGD to variations in hyperparameters.

TL;DR: This paper investigates how learning rate affects weight and bias fluctuations in neural networks and their relationship with model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The relationship between learning rate and neural parameter fluctuations is underexplored, despite fluctuations being crucial for escaping local minima and improving generalization.

Method: Trained models with different learning rates and analyzed the magnitude and characteristics of weight and bias fluctuations, correlating them with final accuracy.

Result: Established a clear link between learning rate values, fluctuation patterns, and overall model performance.

Conclusion: Provides deeper insights into how learning rate mediates the exploration-exploitation trade-off during training, contributing to better understanding of hyperparameter tuning and deep learning mechanics.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) rely on inherent fluctuations in their internal parameters (weights and biases) to effectively navigate the complex optimization landscape and achieve robust performance. While these fluctuations are recognized as crucial for escaping local minima and improving generalization, their precise relationship with fundamental hyperparameters remains underexplored. A significant knowledge gap exists concerning how the learning rate, a critical parameter governing the training process, directly influences the dynamics of these neural fluctuations. This study systematically investigates the impact of varying learning rates on the magnitude and character of weight and bias fluctuations within a neural network. We trained a model using distinct learning rates and analyzed the corresponding parameter fluctuations in conjunction with the network's final accuracy. Our findings aim to establish a clear link between the learning rate's value, the resulting fluctuation patterns, and overall model performance. By doing so, we provide deeper insights into the optimization process, shedding light on how the learning rate mediates the crucial exploration-exploitation trade-off during training. This work contributes to a more nuanced understanding of hyperparameter tuning and the underlying mechanics of deep learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Perturbation-based explanations suffer from unreliable model behavior under perturbations. The paper shows uncertainty calibration affects explanation quality and introduces ReCalX to recalibrate models for better explanations while preserving original predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Perturbation-based explanations are widely used but unreliable due to unknown model behavior under specific perturbations. The relationship between uncertainty calibration and explanation quality needs investigation.

Method: Introduces ReCalX, a novel approach to recalibrate models for improved explanations while preserving original predictions. The method addresses perturbation-specific miscalibration.

Result: Empirical evaluations show ReCalX consistently reduces perturbation-specific miscalibration most effectively, enhances explanation robustness, and improves identification of globally important input features.

Conclusion: ReCalX successfully addresses the reliability issues in perturbation-based explanations by recalibrating model uncertainty while maintaining original prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Perturbation-based explanations are widely utilized to enhance the transparency of machine-learning models in practice. However, their reliability is often compromised by the unknown model behavior under the specific perturbations used. This paper investigates the relationship between uncertainty calibration - the alignment of model confidence with actual accuracy - and perturbation-based explanations. We show that models systematically produce unreliable probability estimates when subjected to explainability-specific perturbations and theoretically prove that this directly undermines global and local explanation quality. To address this, we introduce ReCalX, a novel approach to recalibrate models for improved explanations while preserving their original predictions. Empirical evaluations across diverse models and datasets demonstrate that ReCalX consistently reduces perturbation-specific miscalibration most effectively while enhancing explanation robustness and the identification of globally important input features.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Intrinsic Dimensionality (ID) as a model-free measure of class imbalance that considers data complexity, outperforming traditional cardinality-based methods and showing further improvement when combined with cardinality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cardinality-based imbalance measures ignore redundant examples and inherent class learning difficulties, while complex measures like training loss require model training. There's a need for an easy-to-compute, model-free imbalance measure.

Method: Proposes using data Intrinsic Dimensionality (ID) as an imbalance measure that can be incorporated into various imbalance mitigation methods, and explores combining ID with cardinality.

Result: Across five datasets with diverse imbalance ratios, ID consistently outperforms cardinality-based re-weighting and re-sampling techniques. Combining ID with cardinality further improves performance.

Conclusion: Intrinsic Dimensionality is an effective, model-free measure for class imbalance that captures data complexity and outperforms traditional approaches, with potential for further enhancement through combination with cardinality.

Abstract: Imbalance in classification tasks is commonly quantified by the cardinalities of examples across classes. This, however, disregards the presence of redundant examples and inherent differences in the learning difficulties of classes. Alternatively, one can use complex measures such as training loss and uncertainty, which, however, depend on training a machine learning model. Our paper proposes using data Intrinsic Dimensionality (ID) as an easy-to-compute, model-free measure of imbalance that can be seamlessly incorporated into various imbalance mitigation methods. Our results across five different datasets with a diverse range of imbalance ratios show that ID consistently outperforms cardinality-based re-weighting and re-sampling techniques used in the literature. Moreover, we show that combining ID with cardinality can further improve performance. Code: https://github.com/cagries/IDIM.

### [250] [Panda: Test-Time Adaptation with Negative Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10481)
*Ruxi Deng,Wenxuan Bao,Tianxin Wei,Jingrui He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Panda is a test-time adaptation method that uses negative data augmentation to improve VLM robustness against image corruptions, addressing computational overhead and prediction bias issues of positive data augmentation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pretrained VLMs perform poorly under image corruptions, and existing test-time adaptation methods using positive data augmentation suffer from high computational costs and fail to mitigate prediction bias.

Method: Panda generates negative augmentations by dividing images into patches and randomly assembling them from a shared pool, then subtracts the mean feature of negative samples from original image features to suppress corruption-related components.

Result: Panda achieves superior performance compared to PDA methods and significantly enhances various TTA methods when integrated, with minimal computational overhead due to shared augmentations across batches.

Conclusion: Panda effectively improves VLM robustness against corruptions by removing corruption-specific features while preserving class-relevant information, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing TTA frameworks.

Abstract: Pretrained VLMs exhibit strong zero-shot classification capabilities, but their predictions degrade significantly under common image corruptions. To improve robustness, many test-time adaptation (TTA) methods adopt positive data augmentation (PDA), which generates multiple views of each test sample to reduce prediction variance. However, these methods suffer from two key limitations. First, it introduces considerable computational overhead due to the large number of augmentations required per image. Second, it fails to mitigate prediction bias, where the model tends to predict certain classes disproportionately under corruption, as PDA operates on corrupted inputs and typically does not remove the corruption itself. To address these challenges, we propose Panda, a novel TTA method based on negative data augmentation (NDA). Unlike positive augmentations that preserve object semantics, Panda generates negative augmentations by disrupting semantic content. It divides images into patches and randomly assembles them from a shared patch pool. These negatively augmented images retain corruption-specific features while discarding object-relevant signals. We then subtract the mean feature of these negative samples from the original image feature, effectively suppressing corruption-related components while preserving class-relevant information. This mitigates prediction bias under distribution shifts. Panda allows augmentation to be shared across samples within a batch, resulting in minimal computational overhead. Panda can be seamlessly integrated into existing test-time adaptation frameworks and substantially improve their robustness. Our experiments indicate that Panda delivers superior performance compared to PDA methods, and a wide range of TTA methods exhibit significantly enhanced performance when integrated with Panda.

TL;DR: Proposes KINN with velocity relation enforcement in loss function to improve long-term stock prediction by addressing volatility, OOD data, and outliers through learning both future points and velocity relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address problems of series volatility, Out-of-Distribution test data, and outliers in training data that cause unrealistic spurious predictions in stock forecasting.

Method: Kinematic-Informed Neural Networks (KINN) with loss function that penalizes errors between predictions and labels, plus errors between next point prediction and previous point plus velocity prediction.

Result: Statistically meaningful improvement across normalization-sensitive activation functions prone to spurious behavior in OOD conditions, tested on multiple AR ANN architectures with 15 years of Dow Jones data.

Conclusion: The architecture addresses normalization issues in auto-regressive models by weakly enforcing data neighborhood proximity preservation during ANN transformation.

Abstract: We propose loss function week enforcement of the velocity relations between time-series points in the Kinematic-Informed artificial Neural Networks (KINN) for long-term stock prediction. Problems of the series volatility, Out-of-Distribution (OOD) test data, and outliers in training data are addressed by (Artificial Neural Networks) ANN's learning not only future points prediction but also by learning velocity relations between the points, such a way as avoiding unrealistic spurious predictions. The presented loss function penalizes not only errors between predictions and supervised label data, but also errors between the next point prediction and the previous point plus velocity prediction. The loss function is tested on the multiple popular and exotic AR ANN architectures, and around fifteen years of Dow Jones function demonstrated statistically meaningful improvement across the normalization-sensitive activation functions prone to spurious behaviour in the OOD data conditions. Results show that such architecture addresses the issue of the normalization in the auto-regressive models that break the data topology by weakly enforcing the data neighbourhood proximity (relation) preservation during the ANN transformation.

TL;DR: Holonorm is proposed as a novel normalization function to replace Tanh in transformers, addressing Tanh's orthogonality, linearity, and distortion problems while preserving signal properties and improving model stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tanh faces orthogonality, linearity, and distortion problems in transformer normalization, making previous DyT approach unreliable. There's a need for a better normalization function that preserves signal properties.

Method: Proposed Holonorm (hn) with residual connections and nonlinearity, which preserves orthogonality, direction, and invertibility of signals. It maps vectors into the open unit ball and serves as a generalized softsign function suitable for high-dimensional tensors.

Result: Holonorm prevents exploding activations and improves stability in deep Transformer models. It provides better interpretability as hn serves as a percentage between 0 and 1, with 1-hn as its complement.

Conclusion: Holonorm is a superior normalization function that addresses Tanh's limitations, preserves signal properties, improves model stability, and offers better interpretability for transformer architectures.

Abstract: Normalization is a key point in transformer training . In Dynamic Tanh (DyT), the author demonstrated that Tanh can be used as an alternative layer normalization (LN) and confirmed the effectiveness of the idea. But Tanh itself faces orthogonality, linearity and distortion problems. Due to that, his proposition cannot be reliable. So we propose a Holonorm (hn) which has residual connections and nonlinearity. Holonorm is suitable for replacing Tanh in the context of normalization. Although the HoloNorm expression could be similar to the softsign function in dimension one, softsign is a componentwise function which is not good for tensors and vectors of great dimension. Holonorm preserves the orthogonality, the direction, the invertibility of the signal. Holonorm is also a suitable metric, maps all vectors into the open unit ball. This prevents exploding activations and improves stability in deep Transformer models. In this work, we have meticulously examined the normalization in transformers and say that Holonorm, a generalized form of softsign function suited as a normalization function first.Second, defined between 0 and 1 hn serves as a percentage, and $1 - \text{Holonorm}$ is its complement, making it better understandable in evaluating a model.

TL;DR: Proposes an information-theoretical framework for compressing atomistic datasets by framing it as a minimum set cover problem, achieving efficient data reduction while preserving diversity and outlier information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large MLIP training datasets are computationally expensive to produce and train on, while smaller datasets risk losing important atomic environments and compromising model accuracy/reliability.

Method: Frames atomistic dataset compression as a minimum set cover problem over atom-centered environments, identifying the smallest subset that contains maximum information from the original dataset while pruning redundancy.

Result: MSC method consistently retains outliers, preserves dataset diversity, reproduces long-tail force distributions even at high compression rates, and outperforms other subsampling methods across 64 varied datasets.

Conclusion: The approach enables training improved MLIPs at lower cost, with reduced error for out-of-distribution data, and is implemented in the open-source QUESTS package for various atomistic modeling tasks.

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) balance high accuracy and lower costs compared to density functional theory calculations, but their performance often depends on the size and diversity of training datasets. Large datasets improve model accuracy and generalization but are computationally expensive to produce and train on, while smaller datasets risk discarding rare but important atomic environments and compromising MLIP accuracy/reliability. Here, we develop an information-theoretical framework to quantify the efficiency of dataset compression methods and propose an algorithm that maximizes this efficiency. By framing atomistic dataset compression as an instance of the minimum set cover (MSC) problem over atom-centered environments, our method identifies the smallest subset of structures that contains as much information as possible from the original dataset while pruning redundant information. The approach is extensively demonstrated on the GAP-20 and TM23 datasets, and validated on 64 varied datasets from the ColabFit repository. Across all cases, MSC consistently retains outliers, preserves dataset diversity, and reproduces the long-tail distributions of forces even at high compression rates, outperforming other subsampling methods. Furthermore, MLIPs trained on MSC-compressed datasets exhibit reduced error for out-of-distribution data even in low-data regimes. We explain these results using an outlier analysis and show that such quantitative conclusions could not be achieved with conventional dimensionality reduction methods. The algorithm is implemented in the open-source QUESTS package and can be used for several tasks in atomistic modeling, from data subsampling, outlier detection, and training improved MLIPs at a lower cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing satellite-based precipitation products that rely on IR channels alone or use error-prone calibration data, especially for sub-daily timescales in data-sparse Global South regions.

Method: Two-stage deep learning approach using two U-Net models: one for precipitation detection and another for quantitative precipitation estimation, trained on GPM CORRA v07 data and pre-trained on IMERG-Final retrievals.

Result: Achieves quasi-global coverage through multiple GEO satellites and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing regional and global precipitation baselines.

Conclusion: Oya offers a promising pathway to improved precipitation monitoring and forecasting, particularly benefiting regions with sparse ground-based observation networks.

Abstract: Accurate precipitation estimation is critical for hydrological applications, especially in the Global South where ground-based observation networks are sparse and forecasting skill is limited. Existing satellite-based precipitation products often rely on the longwave infrared channel alone or are calibrated with data that can introduce significant errors, particularly at sub-daily timescales. This study introduces Oya, a novel real-time precipitation retrieval algorithm utilizing the full spectrum of visible and infrared (VIS-IR) observations from geostationary (GEO) satellites. Oya employs a two-stage deep learning approach, combining two U-Net models: one for precipitation detection and another for quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE), to address the inherent data imbalance between rain and no-rain events. The models are trained using high-resolution GPM Combined Radar-Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA) v07 data as ground truth and pre-trained on IMERG-Final retrievals to enhance robustness and mitigate overfitting due to the limited temporal sampling of CORRA. By leveraging multiple GEO satellites, Oya achieves quasi-global coverage and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing competitive regional and global precipitation baselines, offering a promising pathway to improved precipitation monitoring and forecasting.

TL;DR: LayerNorm's role differs in Pre- vs Post-LayerNorm transformers: critical for stable learning in Pre-LayerNorm but affects memorization in Post-LayerNorm models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LayerNorm influences memorization and learning in Pre- and Post-LayerNorm transformers, as its impact remains unclear despite being a fundamental component.

Method: Analyzed 13 models across 6 Vision and Language datasets, examining LayerNorm's effects by eliminating parameters and studying layer-wise importance.

Result: LayerNorm elimination exacerbates memorization and destabilizes learning in Pre-LayerNorm models, while mitigating memorization in Post-LayerNorm models. Early layers' LayerNorm is most critical.

Conclusion: LayerNorm plays distinct roles in shaping memorization and learning across transformer architectures, with early layers being particularly influential.

Abstract: Layer Normalization (LayerNorm) is one of the fundamental components in transformers that stabilizes training and improves optimization. In recent times, Pre-LayerNorm transformers have become the preferred choice over Post-LayerNorm transformers due to their stable gradient flow. However, the impact of LayerNorm on learning and memorization across these architectures remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how LayerNorm influences memorization and learning for Pre- and Post-LayerNorm transformers. We identify that LayerNorm serves as a key factor for stable learning in Pre-LayerNorm transformers, while in Post-LayerNorm transformers, it impacts memorization. Our analysis reveals that eliminating LayerNorm parameters in Pre-LayerNorm models exacerbates memorization and destabilizes learning, while in Post-LayerNorm models, it effectively mitigates memorization by restoring genuine labels. We further precisely identify that early layers LayerNorm are the most critical over middle/later layers and their influence varies across Pre and Post LayerNorm models. We have validated it through 13 models across 6 Vision and Language datasets. These insights shed new light on the role of LayerNorm in shaping memorization and learning in transformers.

TL;DR: Belief Net is a novel framework that learns HMM parameters through gradient-based optimization by formulating the HMM's forward filter as a structured neural network, achieving superior convergence speed compared to Baum-Welch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical HMM learning methods like Baum-Welch are computationally intensive and prone to local optima, while spectral algorithms may produce invalid probability outputs. There's a need for efficient, interpretable HMM learning.

Method: Formulates HMM's forward filter as a structured neural network where learnable weights are explicitly the logits of initial distribution, transition matrix, and emission matrix. Uses decoder-only architecture with autoregressive next-observation prediction loss.

Result: Achieves superior convergence speed compared to Baum-Welch, successfully recovers parameters in both undercomplete and overcomplete settings where spectral methods fail. Also compares favorably with Transformer models on real-world language data.

Conclusion: Belief Net provides an efficient, interpretable alternative to traditional HMM learning methods, combining the benefits of neural optimization with explicit parameter interpretability.

Abstract: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are fundamental for modeling sequential data, yet learning their parameters from observations remains challenging. Classical methods like the Baum-Welch (EM) algorithm are computationally intensive and prone to local optima, while modern spectral algorithms offer provable guarantees but may produce probability outputs outside valid ranges. This work introduces Belief Net, a novel framework that learns HMM parameters through gradient-based optimization by formulating the HMM's forward filter as a structured neural network. Unlike black-box Transformer models, Belief Net's learnable weights are explicitly the logits of the initial distribution, transition matrix, and emission matrix, ensuring full interpretability. The model processes observation sequences using a decoder-only architecture and is trained end-to-end with standard autoregressive next-observation prediction loss. On synthetic HMM data, Belief Net achieves superior convergence speed compared to Baum-Welch, successfully recovering parameters in both undercomplete and overcomplete settings where spectral methods fail. Comparisons with Transformer-based models are also presented on real-world language data.

TL;DR: Proposes a Responsible Reinforcement Learning (RRL) framework that integrates emotional context and ethical constraints into personalized decision systems, addressing limitations of traditional rule-based approaches in healthcare and behavioral support domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional personalized decision systems use static rule-based or engagement-maximizing heuristics that overlook users' emotional context and ethical constraints, risking insensitive or unsafe interventions in sensitive domains like mental health and substance use disorders.

Method: Formulates personalization as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) with multi-objective reward function balancing short-term engagement and long-term well-being, using emotion-informed state representation and safety-constrained RL algorithms (DQN, PPO).

Result: Conceptual framework that operationalizes empathy and responsibility in machine learning policy optimization, bridging safe RL, affective computing and responsible AI for emotionally aware personalization systems.

Conclusion: The RRL framework initiates methodological conversation about ethically aligned reinforcement learning for trustworthy personalization systems in human-centric domains like behavioral health, education, and digital therapeutics.

Abstract: Personalized decision systems in healthcare and behavioral support often rely on static rule-based or engagement-maximizing heuristics that overlook users' emotional context and ethical constraints. Such approaches risk recommending insensitive or unsafe interventions, especially in domains involving serious mental illness, substance use disorders, or depression. To address this limitation, we propose a Responsible Reinforcement Learning (RRL) framework that integrates emotional and contextual understanding with ethical considerations into the sequential decision-making process. RRL formulates personalization as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), where the agent optimizes engagement and adherence while ensuring emotional alignment and ethical safety. We introduce a multi-objective reward function that explicitly balances short-term behavioral engagement with long-term user well-being, and define an emotion-informed state representation that captures fluctuations in emotional readiness, affect, and risk. The proposed architecture can be instantiated with any RL algorithm (e.g., DQN, PPO) augmented with safety constraints or Lagrangian regularization. Conceptually, this framework operationalizes empathy and responsibility within machine learning policy optimization, bridging safe RL, affective computing and responsible AI. We discuss the implications of this approach for human-centric domains such as behavioral health, education, and digital therapeutics, and outline simulation-based validation paths for future empirical work. This paper aims to initiate a methodological conversation about ethically aligned reinforcement learning for emotionally aware and trustworthy personalization systems.

Conclusion: The LC-KSVD2 + LISTA/LISTAConv pipeline offers an interpretable and computationally efficient alternative to modern deep architectures, confirming the viability of bridging classical sparse coding with deep learning.

Abstract: We present a semi-unified sparse dictionary learning framework that bridges the gap between classical sparse models and modern deep architectures. Specifically, the method integrates strict Top-$K$ LISTA and its convex FISTA-based variant (LISTAConv) into the discriminative LC-KSVD2 model, enabling co-evolution between the sparse encoder and the dictionary under supervised or unsupervised regimes. This unified design retains the interpretability of traditional sparse coding while benefiting from efficient, differentiable training.

*Yuval Shapira,Dana Drachsler-Cohen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel linear bound propagation method for verifying neural network robustness against few-pixel attacks, achieving 3.16x geometric mean speedup over state-of-the-art verifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing local robustness verifiers rely on linear bound propagation for convex perturbation spaces, but few-pixel attacks operate in non-convex L0-balls, creating a mismatch that limits verification efficiency.

Method: The authors show that the convex hull of an L0-ball is the intersection of its bounding box and an asymmetrically scaled L1-like polytope. They develop a linear bound propagation that precisely computes bounds over this convex hull.

Result: The proposed bound propagation scales the state-of-the-art L0 verifier by 1.24x-7.07x on challenging robustness benchmarks, with a geometric mean speedup of 3.16x.

Conclusion: The method effectively bridges the gap between convex verification techniques and non-convex L0 perturbation spaces, significantly improving verification efficiency for few-pixel attacks.

Abstract: Few-pixel attacks mislead a classifier by modifying a few pixels of an image. Their perturbation space is an $\ell_0$-ball, which is not convex, unlike $\ell_p$-balls for $p\geq1$. However, existing local robustness verifiers typically scale by relying on linear bound propagation, which captures convex perturbation spaces. We show that the convex hull of an $\ell_0$-ball is the intersection of its bounding box and an asymmetrically scaled $\ell_1$-like polytope. The volumes of the convex hull and this polytope are nearly equal as the input dimension increases. We then show a linear bound propagation that precisely computes bounds over the convex hull and is significantly tighter than bound propagations over the bounding box or our $\ell_1$-like polytope. This bound propagation scales the state-of-the-art $\ell_0$ verifier on its most challenging robustness benchmarks by 1.24x-7.07x, with a geometric mean of 3.16.

Conclusion: The approach offers a promising solution for large-scale drug discovery applications by significantly accelerating the discovery of potent inhibitors through improved Batch Bayesian Optimization.

Abstract: Batched synthesis and testing of molecular designs is the key bottleneck of drug development. There has been great interest in leveraging biomolecular foundation models as surrogates to accelerate this process. In this work, we show how to obtain scalable probabilistic surrogates of binding affinity for use in Batch Bayesian Optimization (Batch BO). This demands parallel acquisition functions that hedge between designs and the ability to rapidly sample from a joint predictive density to approximate them. Through the framework of Epistemic Neural Networks (ENNs), we obtain scalable joint predictive distributions of binding affinity on top of representations taken from large structure-informed models. Key to this work is an investigation into the importance of prior networks in ENNs and how to pretrain them on synthetic data to improve downstream performance in Batch BO. Their utility is demonstrated by rediscovering known potent EGFR inhibitors on a semi-synthetic benchmark in up to 5x fewer iterations, as well as potent inhibitors from a real-world small-molecule library in up to 10x fewer iterations, offering a promising solution for large-scale drug discovery applications.

*Zhentian Zhang,David Morales-Jimenez,Hao Jiang,Christos Masouros*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper studies finite blocklength fluid antenna systems (FBL-FAS) and derives a general block error rate (BLER) bound that serves as a universal performance benchmark for various FAS architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research rarely investigates the impact of finite blocklength constraints on FAS designs, leaving gaps in analytical modeling and performance metrics for FBL-FAS.

Method: The authors derive a BLER bound that is computable both with and without explicit statistical models, enabling performance characterization under model-aware or model-free scenarios.

Result: The proposed BLER bound shows strong alignment between analytical results and empirical findings when statistical models are known, demonstrating simplicity, accuracy, and universality.

Conclusion: The derived BLER bound provides a practical and general performance benchmark for finite blocklength fluid antenna systems across various architectures.

Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FASs) offer genuine simplicity for communication network design by eliminating expensive hardware overhead and reducing the complexity of access protocol architectures. Through the discovery of significant spatial diversity within a compact antenna space, FASs enable the implementation of reconfigurable-antenna-based architectures. However, current state-of-the-art studies rarely investigate the impact of finite blocklength constraints on FAS-based designs, leaving a gap in both analytical modeling and the establishment of a solid, universally applicable performance metric for finite blocklength fluid antenna systems (FBL-FAS). In this work, we focus on the study of FBL-FAS and, more importantly, derive a block error rate (BLER) bound that serves as a general and practical performance benchmark across various FAS architectures. The proposed BLER bound is computable both with and without an explicit statistical model, meaning that the BLER performance can be characterized analytically or empirically under model-aware or model-free system scenarios. Moreover, when the statistical model is known, the analytical results derived from the proposed BLER bound exhibit strong alignment with the empirical findings, demonstrating the remarkable simplicity, accuracy, and universality of the proposed BLER bound.

### [262] [Implicit Semantic Communication Based on Bayesian Reconstruction Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10052)
*Yiwei Liao,Shurui Tu,Yujie Zhou,Dongzi Jin,Yong Xiao,Yingyu Li*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Proposes a Bayesian hypergraph inference framework for semantic communication that recovers high-order semantic relationships from pairwise relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic communication methods use pairwise relation-based graphs which cannot capture essential higher-order interactions in semantic sources.

Method: Bayesian hypergraph inference framework that recovers implicit high-order hyperedges from pairwise explicit semantics sent by transmitter.

Result: Achieves up to 90% recovery accuracy of high-order hyperedges based on pairwise relation-based explicit semantics on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully bridges the gap between pairwise explicit semantics and high-order implicit semantics in semantic communication.

Abstract: Semantic communication is a novel communication paradigm that focuses on the transportation and delivery of the \emph{meaning} of messages. Recent results have verified that a graphical structure provides the most expressive and structurally faithful formalism for representing the relational semantics in most information sources. However, most existing works represent the semantics based on pairwise relation-based graphs, which cannot capture the higher-order interactions that are essential for some semantic sources. This paper proposes a novel Bayesian hypergraph inference-based semantic communication framework that can directly recover implicit semantic information involving high-order hyperedges at the receiver based on the pairwise relation-based explicit semantics sent by the transmitter. Experimental results based on real-world datasets demonstrated that the proposed SBRF achieves up to 90\% recovery accuracy of the high-order hyperedges based on the pairwise relation-based explicit semantics.

### [263] [Generalized Spectral Bound for Quasi-Twisted Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10066)

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper extends an improved spectral bound from quasi-cyclic codes to quasi-twisted codes, showing it outperforms existing bounds like Jensen and Ezerman bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous spectral bounds for quasi-twisted codes had worse performance than the Jensen bound. Recent improvements for quasi-cyclic codes motivated extending this approach to quasi-twisted codes.

Method: Adopt and generalize the improved spectral bound approach from quasi-cyclic codes to the quasi-twisted case.

Result: The new generalized spectral bound provides tighter lower bounds on minimum distance compared to Jensen and Ezerman et al. bounds.

Conclusion: The extended spectral bound for quasi-twisted codes successfully improves upon existing bounds for minimum distance estimation.

Abstract: Semenov and Trifonov [22] developed a spectral theory for quasi-cyclic codes and formulated a BCH-like minimum distance bound. Their approach was generalized by Zeh and Ling [24], by using the HT bound. The first spectral bound for quasi-twisted codes appeared in [7], which generalizes Semenov-Trifonov and Zeh-Ling bounds, but its overall performance was observed to be worse than the Jensen bound. More recently, an improved spectral bound for quasi-cyclic codes was proposed in [15], which outperforms the Jensen bound in many cases. In this paper, we adopt this approach to quasi-twisted case and we show that this new generalized spectral bound provides tighter lower bounds on the minimum distance compared to the Jensen and Ezerman et. al. bounds.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Analysis of adversarial binary hypothesis testing in sequential setting with convex distribution sets, characterizing achievable error exponents and studying constraints on observation count and error probability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the performance limits of sequential hypothesis testing when an adversary can adaptively choose distributions from convex sets based on past observations, which models scenarios with strategic opponents or uncertain environments.

Method: Study sequential binary hypothesis testing where each hypothesis has a convex set of distributions, and an adversary selects distributions from these sets based on observation history. Analyze variable observation count and characterize closure of achievable error exponent pairs.

Result: Characterized the closure of the set of achievable pairs of error exponents in the sequential adversarial setting, showing improved asymptotic performance compared to fixed-sample tests. Also analyzed performance under constraints on number of observations and error probability.

Conclusion: Sequential testing with variable observation count provides performance advantages in adversarial binary hypothesis testing, with characterized achievable error exponents and analysis of practical constraints.

Abstract: We study the adversarial binary hypothesis testing problem in the sequential setting. Associated with each hypothesis is a closed, convex set of distributions. Given the hypothesis, each observation is generated according to a distribution chosen (from the set associated with the hypothesis) by an adversary who has access to past observations. In the sequential setting, the number of observations the detector uses to arrive at a decision is variable; this extra freedom improves the asymptotic performance of the test. We characterize the closure of the set of achievable pairs of error exponents. We also study the problem under constraints on the number of observations used and the probability of error incurred.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: A causal model-based multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that uses structural causal models and attention networks to improve sample efficiency and interpretability for wireless IoT systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the sample inefficiency of multi-agent RL in wireless IoT deployments by developing interpretable causal models instead of black-box approaches.

Method: Leverage structural causal models and attention-based inference networks to represent causal dependencies, develop interpretable causal models for MAC control, and use data augmentation with PPO for policy optimization.

Result: Achieves 58% reduction in environment interactions, faster convergence than model-free baselines, and provides interpretable scheduling decisions via attention-based causal attribution.

Conclusion: Causal MBRL offers a practical combination of sample efficiency and interpretability for resource-constrained wireless systems, with exponential sample complexity gains over black-box approaches.

Abstract: Despite the advantages of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for wireless use case such as medium access control (MAC), their real-world deployment in Internet of Things (IoT) is hindered by their sample inefficiency. To alleviate this challenge, one can leverage model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) solutions, however, conventional MBRL approaches rely on black-box models that are not interpretable and cannot reason. In contrast, in this paper, a novel causal model-based MARL framework is developed by leveraging tools from causal learn- ing. In particular, the proposed model can explicitly represent causal dependencies between network variables using structural causal models (SCMs) and attention-based inference networks. Interpretable causal models are then developed to capture how MAC control messages influence observations, how transmission actions determine outcomes, and how channel observations affect rewards. Data augmentation techniques are then used to generate synthetic rollouts using the learned causal model for policy optimization via proximal policy optimization (PPO). Analytical results demonstrate exponential sample complexity gains of causal MBRL over black-box approaches. Extensive simulations demonstrate that, on average, the proposed approach can reduce environment interactions by 58%, and yield faster convergence compared to model-free baselines. The proposed approach inherently is also shown to provide interpretable scheduling decisions via attention-based causal attribution, revealing which network conditions drive the policy. The resulting combination of sample efficiency and interpretability establishes causal MBRL as a practical approach for resource-constrained wireless systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-altitude UAV networks face deployment challenges due to high mobility, complex propagation environments, and sensing-communication trade-offs in 6G ISAC systems.

Conclusion: Identifies key technical challenges and research opportunities for designing advanced low-altitude ISAC networks using MA-IRS framework.

Abstract: Low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks are integral to future 6G integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. However, their deployment is hindered by challenges stemming from high mobility of UAVs, complex propagation environments, and the inherent trade-offs between coexisting sensing and communication functions. This article proposes a novel framework that leverages movable antennas (MAs) and intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) as dual enablers to overcome these limitations. MAs, through active transceiver reconfiguration, and IRSs, via passive channel reconstruction, can work in synergy to significantly enhance system performance. Our analysis first elaborates on the fundamental gains offered by MAs and IRSs, and provides simulation results that validate the immense potential of the MA-IRS-enabled ISAC architecture. Two core UAV deployment scenarios are then investigated: (i) UAVs as ISAC users, where we focus on achieving high-precision tracking and aerial safety, and (ii) UAVs as aerial network nodes, where we address robust design and complex coupled resource optimization. Finally, key technical challenges and research opportunities are identified and analyzed for each scenario, charting a clear course for the future design of advanced low-altitude ISAC networks.

*Yu Zhao,Li You,Jinke Tang,Mengyu Qian,Bin Jiang,Xiang-Gen Xia,Xiqi Gao*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper proposes Multi-Group Adjustable Phase Shift Pilots (MAPSPs) for massive MIMO-OFDM systems to reduce channel acquisition overhead and improve spectral efficiency by exploiting channel sparsity and mitigating pilot interference through phase scheduling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Massive MIMO-OFDM systems face high channel acquisition overhead despite providing significant spectral efficiency. Existing APSP techniques need extension to multiple groups for further SE improvement.

Method: Transform channel model to angle-delay domain for sparsity, generate MAPSPs using multiple basic sequences, analyze pilot interference effects on MMSE estimation, implement phase scheduling using Zadoff-Chu sequences with pre-processing and scheduling methods.

Result: MAPSP achieves lower mean square error than APSP and significantly enhances spectral efficiency in mobility scenarios.

Conclusion: MAPSP method effectively reduces channel estimation overhead and improves spectral efficiency in massive MIMO-OFDM systems through multi-group phase scheduling and interference mitigation.

Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output - orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems face the challenge of high channel acquisition overhead while providing significant spectral efficiency (SE). Adjustable phase shift pilots (APSPs) are an effective technique to acquire channels with low overhead by exploiting channel sparsity. In this paper, we extend it to multiple groups and propose multi-group adjustable phase shift pilots (MAPSPs) to improve SE further. We first introduce a massive MIMO-OFDM system model and transform the conventional channel model in the space-frequency domain to the angle-delay domain, obtaining a sparse channel matrix. Then, we propose a method of generating MAPSPs through multiple basic sequences and investigate channel estimation processes. By analyzing the components of pilot interference, we elucidate the underlying mechanism by which interference affects MMSE estimation. Building upon this foundation, we demonstrate the benefit of phase scheduling in MAPSP channel estimation and establish the optimal design condition tailored for scheduling. Furthermore, we propose an implementation scheme based on Zadoff-Chu sequences that includes received signal pre-processing and pilot scheduling methods to mitigate pilot interference. Simulation results indicate that the MAPSP method achieves a lower mean square error (MSE) of estimation than APSP and significantly enhances SE in mobility scenarios.

TL;DR: Proposes ASSENT, a GNN framework for joint AP clustering and user/target scheduling in distributed cell-free ISAC systems under fronthaul constraints, achieving near-optimal performance with low latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ISAC solutions lack scalable methods for joint AP clustering and scheduling in distributed deployments, relying on centralized processing and full CSI which limits scalability.

Method: Formulates the problem as MILP for optimal solutions, then trains a GNN framework (ASSENT) on these solutions to learn association policies from lightweight link statistics.

Result: ASSENT achieves near-optimal utility, accurately learns underlying associations, and reduces decision latency through single forward pass inference compared to optimization methods.

Conclusion: ASSENT enables real-time, scalable operation in cell-free ISAC systems while providing near-optimal performance, with open-source implementation available for reproducible research.

Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is a key emerging 6G technology. Despite progress, ISAC still lacks scalable methods for joint AP clustering and user/target scheduling in distributed deployments under fronthaul limits. Moreover, existing ISAC solutions largely rely on centralized processing and full channel state information, limiting scalability. This paper addresses joint access point (AP) clustering, user and target scheduling, and AP mode selection in distributed cell-free ISAC systems operating with constrained fronthaul capacity. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that jointly captures interference coupling, RF-chain limits, and sensing requirements, providing optimal but computationally demanding solutions. To enable real-time and scalable operation, we propose ASSENT (ASSociation and ENTity selection), a graph neural network (GNN) framework trained on MILP solutions to efficiently learn association and mode-selection policies directly from lightweight link statistics. Simulations show that ASSENT achieves near-optimal utility while accurately learning the underlying associations. Additionally, its single forward pass inference reduces decision latency compared to optimization-based methods. An open-source Python/PyTorch implementation with full datasets is provided to facilitate reproducible and extensible research in cell-free ISAC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rotatable IRS introduces spatial DoF through dynamic orientation adjustment without changing element positions, enabling enhanced wireless communication coverage and performance.

Method: Developed an angle-dependent channel model capturing electromagnetic characteristics, used PSO-based algorithms for single location SNR maximization, and two-loop PSO with null-point detection for area coverage enhancement.

Result: Significant SNR improvement achieved over benchmark schemes under various system setups, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed rotatable IRS design.

Conclusion: Rotatable IRS with optimized rotation angles provides substantial performance gains for wireless communications, with the proposed algorithms effectively solving the optimization problems.

Abstract: Rotatable intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) introduces a new spatial degree of freedom (DoF) by dynamically adjusting orientations without the need of changing its elements' positions in real time. To unleash the full potential of rotatable IRSs for wireless communications, this paper investigates the joint optimization of IRS rotation angles to maximize the minimum expected signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over all locations within a given target area. We first propose an angle-dependent channel model that accurately characterizes the reception and reflection of each IRS element. Different from the conventional cosine-law assumption, the proposed model captures the practical electromagnetic characteristics of the IRS, including the effective reception area and reflection efficiency. For the single target location case, a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based algorithm is developed to solve the SNR maximization problem, and a closed-form expression for a near-optimal solution is derived to provide useful insights. For the general area coverage enhancement case, the optimal rotation is obtained through a two-loop PSO-based iterative algorithm with null-point detection. In this algorithm, the outer loop updates the global rotation angles to maximize the minimum SNR over the target area, whereas the inner loop evaluates the SNR distribution within the area to identify the location corresponding to the minimum SNR through null-point detection. Numerical results demonstrate significant SNR improvement achieved by the proposed rotatable IRS design over various benchmark schemes under different system setups.

*Yuhao Ren,Yiting Liu,Yanfei Zhou,Zhiyu Zheng,Li Shang,Fan Yang,Zhiang Wang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A lightweight co-optimization framework that bridges the initialization gap in VLSI placement by combining area-hint refinement with macro-schedule placement, achieving better wirelength than point-based methods while running 100x faster than area-aware methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing placement initialization methods face a trade-off: area-aware methods are accurate but computationally expensive, while fast point-based methods ignore cell area, creating a modeling gap that impairs convergence and solution quality.

Method: Two strategies: 1) Area-hint refinement initializer incorporates heuristic cell area information using virtual nodes and negative-weight edges on the netlist graph; 2) Macro-schedule placement procedure progressively restores area constraints for smooth transition to full area-aware objective.

Result: Evaluated on 12 cases (ISPD2005 benchmarks and industrial designs). Improved HPWL over point-based initializers in 11/12 cases, achieving up to 2.2% HPWL reduction, while running ~100x faster than state-of-the-art area-aware initializer.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively bridges the initialization gap in VLSI placement, delivering high-quality results with significantly improved computational efficiency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Global placement is a critical step with high computational complexity in VLSI physical design. Modern analytical placers formulate the placement problem as a nonlinear optimization, where initialization strongly affects both convergence behavior and final placement quality. However, existing initialization methods exhibit a trade-off: area-aware initializers account for cell areas but are computationally expensive and can dominate total runtime, while fast point-based initializers ignore cell area, leading to a modeling gap that impairs convergence and solution quality. We propose a lightweight co-optimization framework that bridges this initialization gap through two strategies. First, an area-hint refinement initializer incorporates heuristic cell area information into a signed graph signal by augmenting the netlist graph with virtual nodes and negative-weight edges, yielding an area-aware and spectrally smooth placement initialization. Second, a macro-schedule placement procedure progressively restores area constraints, enabling a smooth transition from the refined initializer to the full area-aware objective and producing high-quality placement results. We evaluate the framework on macro-heavy ISPD2005 academic benchmarks and two real-world industrial designs across two technology nodes (12 cases in total). Experimental results show that our method consistently improves half-perimeter wirelength (HPWL) over point-based initializers in 11 out of 12 cases, achieving up to 2.2% HPWL reduction, while running approximately 100 times faster than the state-of-the-art area-aware initializer.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A memory-augmented semantic communication framework using modern Hopfield networks that enables dynamic adaptation to evolving source distributions through soft attention-based retrieval, achieving significant bandwidth savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional joint source-channel coding uses static semantic representations that cannot adapt to changing source distributions, and existing hard quantization approaches require frequent memory updates even for small data changes, leading to inefficient bandwidth usage.

Method: Proposed framework maintains shared semantic memory between transmitter and receiver using modern Hopfield networks, employs soft attention-based retrieval to smoothly adjust stored semantic prototype weights, and jointly optimizes encoder, decoder, and memory retrieval mechanism to maximize reasoning capacity.

Result: Extensive simulations show substantial bit reductions around 14% on average and up to 70% in scenarios with gradual content changes compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The MHN-based approach with soft retrieval effectively reduces unnecessary transmissions and achieves significant bandwidth savings by enabling stable matching decisions under gradual data dynamics.

Abstract: Traditional joint source-channel coding employs static learned semantic representations that cannot dynamically adapt to evolving source distributions. Shared semantic memories between transmitter and receiver can potentially enable bandwidth savings by reusing previously transmitted concepts as context to reconstruct data, but require effective mechanisms to determine when current content is similar enough to stored patterns. However, existing hard quantization approaches based on variational autoencoders are limited by frequent memory updates even under small changes in data dynamics, which leads to inefficient usage of bandwidth.To address this challenge, in this paper, a memory-augmented semantic communication framework is proposed where both transmitter and receiver maintain a shared memory of semantic concepts using modern Hopfield networks (MHNs). The proposed framework employs soft attention-based retrieval that smoothly adjusts stored semantic prototype weights as data evolves that enables stable matching decisions under gradual data dynamics. A joint optimization of encoder, decoder, and memory retrieval
  mechanism is performed with the objective of maximizing a reasoning capacity metric that quantifies semantic efficiency as the product of memory reuse rate and compression ratio. Theoretical analysis establishes the fundamental rate-distortion-reuse tradeoff and proves that soft retrieval reduces unnecessary transmissions compared to hard quantization under bounded semantic drift. Extensive simulations over diverse video scenarios demonstrate that the proposed MHN-based approach achieves substantial bit reductions around 14% on average and up to 70% in scenarios with gradual content changes compared to baseline.

Abstract: Radio-based localization systems conventionally require stationary reference points (e.g. anchors) with precisely surveyed positions, making deployment time-consuming and costly. This paper presents an empirical evaluation of collaborative self-calibration for Ultra-Wideband (UWB) networks, extending a discrete Bayesian approach based on grid-based uncertainty propagation. The enhanced algorithm reduces measurement availability requirements while maintaining positioning accuracy through probabilistic state estimation. We validate the approach using real-world data from controlled indoor UWB network experiments with 12 nodes in a static environment. Experimental evaluation demonstrates 0.28~m mean ranging error under line-of-sight conditions and 1.11~m overall ranging error across mixed propagation scenarios, achieving sub-meter positioning accuracy. Results demonstrate the algorithm's robustness to measurement noise and partial connectivity scenarios typical in industrial deployments.

Method: Uses view-specific ConvNeXt encoders for frontal/lateral X-rays, fused with clinical data (indications, history, vital signs) via transformer fusion module to create context-aware representations that mimic clinical reasoning.

Result: Exceeds state-of-the-art performance on both original MIMIC-CXR dataset and newer CXR-LT benchmarks, demonstrating superior classification accuracy.

Conclusion: Multimodal alignment of imaging data with clinical information significantly advances chest X-ray classification by better reflecting real-world clinical decision-making processes.

Abstract: Radiology is essential to modern healthcare, yet rising demand and staffing shortages continue to pose major challenges. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have the potential to support radiologists and help address these challenges. Given its widespread use and clinical importance, chest X-ray classification is well suited to augment radiologists' workflows. However, most existing approaches rely solely on single-view, image-level inputs, ignoring the structured clinical information and multi-image studies available at the time of reporting. In this work, we introduce CaMCheX, a multimodal transformer-based framework that aligns multi-view chest X-ray studies with structured clinical data to better reflect how clinicians make diagnostic decisions. Our architecture employs view-specific ConvNeXt encoders for frontal and lateral chest radiographs, whose features are fused with clinical indications, history, and vital signs using a transformer fusion module. This design enables the model to generate context-aware representations that mirror reasoning in clinical practice. Our results exceed the state of the art for both the original MIMIC-CXR dataset and the more recent CXR-LT benchmarks, highlighting the value of clinically grounded multimodal alignment for advancing chest X-ray classification.

TL;DR: nnQC is a diffusion-based quality control framework that self-adapts to any organ dataset using a Team of Experts architecture to generate spatially-aware pseudo-ground truths for automated medical image segmentation quality assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quality control methods for medical image segmentation are organ-specific, limiting their generalizability and usability across different organs and datasets, while manual correction is impractical at scale.

Method: Proposes nnQC with a Team of Experts architecture where two experts encode 3D spatial awareness and anatomical information, combined via weighted conditional module to condition diffusion sampling for generating pseudo-ground truths.

Result: nnQC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across seven organs and twelve datasets, including cases with highly degraded or missing segmentation masks, demonstrating versatility and effectiveness.

Conclusion: nnQC provides a robust, adaptable quality control framework that overcomes organ-specific limitations and works effectively across different organs, datasets, and imaging modalities.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation using deep learning (DL) has enabled the development of automated analysis pipelines for large-scale population studies. However, state-of-the-art DL methods are prone to hallucinations, which can result in anatomically implausible segmentations. With manual correction impractical at scale, automated quality control (QC) techniques have to address the challenge. While promising, existing QC methods are organ-specific, limiting their generalizability and usability beyond their original intended task. To overcome this limitation, we propose no-new Quality Control (nnQC), a robust QC framework based on a diffusion-generative paradigm that self-adapts to any input organ dataset. Central to nnQC is a novel Team of Experts (ToE) architecture, where two specialized experts independently encode 3D spatial awareness, represented by the relative spatial position of an axial slice, and anatomical information derived from visual features from the original image. A weighted conditional module dynamically combines the pair of independent embeddings, or opinions to condition the sampling mechanism within a diffusion process, enabling the generation of a spatially aware pseudo-ground truth for predicting QC scores. Within its framework, nnQC integrates fingerprint adaptation to ensure adaptability across organs, datasets, and imaging modalities. We evaluated nnQC on seven organs using twelve publicly available datasets. Our results demonstrate that nnQC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all experiments, including cases where segmentation masks are highly degraded or completely missing, confirming its versatility and effectiveness across different organs.

TL;DR: SAT3D is a lightweight 3D foundation model for robust tumor segmentation across diverse medical imaging modalities, addressing challenges like heterogeneous tissue structures and low-contrast boundaries through uncertainty-aware training and adversarial learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision foundation models struggle with medical imaging due to heterogeneous tissue structures, imaging artifacts, and low-contrast boundaries in tumors, leading to suboptimal segmentation in ambiguous regions.

Method: SAT3D integrates a shifted-window vision transformer for hierarchical volumetric representation with uncertainty-aware training that uses uncertainty estimates as prompts for boundary prediction, plus adversarial learning for ambiguous regions.

Result: SAT3D demonstrates strong generalization and robustness across 11 datasets (3,884 training cases, 694 evaluation cases), outperforming recent vision foundation models and nnUNet in challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: SAT3D shows potential as a scalable foundation model for medical image analysis, with a 3D Slicer plugin enabling practical clinical translation through interactive, prompt-driven segmentation.

Abstract: Prompt-driven vision foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model, have recently demonstrated remarkable adaptability in computer vision. However, their direct application to medical imaging remains challenging due to heterogeneous tissue structures, imaging artefacts, and low-contrast boundaries, particularly in tumours and cancer primaries leading to suboptimal segmentation in ambiguous or overlapping lesion regions. Here, we present Segment Any Tumour 3D (SAT3D), a lightweight volumetric foundation model designed to enable robust and generalisable tumour segmentation across diverse medical imaging modalities. SAT3D integrates a shifted-window vision transformer for hierarchical volumetric representation with an uncertainty-aware training pipeline that explicitly incorporates uncertainty estimates as prompts to guide reliable boundary prediction in low-contrast regions. Adversarial learning further enhances model performance for the ambiguous pathological regions. We benchmark SAT3D against three recent vision foundation models and nnUNet across 11 publicly available datasets, encompassing 3,884 tumour and cancer cases for training and 694 cases for in-distribution evaluation. Trained on 17,075 3D volume-mask pairs across multiple modalities and cancer primaries, SAT3D demonstrates strong generalisation and robustness. To facilitate practical use and clinical translation, we developed a 3D Slicer plugin that enables interactive, prompt-driven segmentation and visualisation using the trained SAT3D model. Extensive experiments highlight its effectiveness in improving segmentation accuracy under challenging and out-of-distribution scenarios, underscoring its potential as a scalable foundation model for medical image analysis.

TL;DR: SuperRivolution framework improves river segmentation resolution using time series of low-resolution satellite images, achieving significant performance gains over single-image methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution satellite imagery for river monitoring is scarce and expensive, while low-resolution imagery is more accessible but provides less detailed information.

Method: Created benchmark dataset of 9,810 low-resolution temporal images with high-resolution labels, tested ensembling, super-resolution, and end-to-end temporal sequence models.

Result: F1 score improved from 60.9% to 80.5% for river segmentation, narrowing gap with high-resolution models (94.1%). Similar improvements in river width estimation.

Conclusion: Publicly available low-resolution satellite archives have strong potential for fine-scale river monitoring when leveraging temporal information.

Abstract: Satellite missions provide valuable optical data for monitoring rivers at diverse spatial and temporal scales. However, accessibility remains a challenge: high-resolution imagery is ideal for fine-grained monitoring but is typically scarce and expensive compared to low-resolution imagery. To address this gap, we introduce SuperRivolution, a framework that improves river segmentation resolution by leveraging information from time series of low-resolution satellite images. We contribute a new benchmark dataset of 9,810 low-resolution temporal images paired with high-resolution labels from an existing river monitoring dataset. Using this benchmark, we investigate multiple strategies for river segmentation, including ensembling single-image models, applying image super-resolution, and developing end-to-end models trained on temporal sequences. SuperRivolution significantly outperforms single-image methods and baseline temporal approaches, narrowing the gap with supervised high-resolution models. For example, the F1 score for river segmentation improves from 60.9% to 80.5%, while the state-of-the-art model operating on high-resolution images achieves 94.1%. Similar improvements are also observed in river width estimation tasks. Our results highlight the potential of publicly available low-resolution satellite archives for fine-scale river monitoring.

TL;DR: PV-DDPM is a diffusion model that generates anomalous electroluminescence images for photovoltaic modules to address dataset scarcity in PV inspection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable anomaly detection in PV modules is constrained by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse datasets for computer vision models.

Method: PV-DDPM uses spatially conditioned denoising diffusion to generate anomalous EL images across four PV cell types, controlled by binary masks for structural features and defect positions.

Result: Generated images achieve FID of 4.10 and KID of 0.0023 ± 0.0007. Training AA-CLIP on the enhanced E-SCDD dataset improves pixel-level AUC by 1.70 and average precision by 8.34 points compared to original SCDD.

Conclusion: PV-DDPM effectively addresses dataset scarcity for PV anomaly detection and improves model performance when used for training.

Abstract: Reliable anomaly detection in photovoltaic (PV) modules is critical for maintaining solar energy efficiency. However, developing robust computer vision models for PV inspection is constrained by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse, and balanced datasets. This study introduces PV-DDPM, a spatially conditioned denoising diffusion probabilistic model that generates anomalous electroluminescence (EL) images across four PV cell types: multi-crystalline silicon (multi-c-Si), mono-crystalline silicon (mono-c-Si), half-cut multi-c-Si, and interdigitated back contact (IBC) with dogbone interconnect. PV-DDPM enables controlled synthesis of single-defect and multi-defect scenarios by conditioning on binary masks representing structural features and defect positions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework that jointly models multiple PV cell types while supporting simultaneous generation of diverse anomaly types. We also introduce E-SCDD, an enhanced version of the SCDD dataset, comprising 1,000 pixel-wise annotated EL images spanning 30 semantic classes, and 1,768 unlabeled synthetic samples. Quantitative evaluation shows our generated images achieve a Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) of 4.10 and Kernel Inception Distance (KID) of 0.0023 $\pm$ 0.0007 across all categories. Training the vision--language anomaly detection model AA-CLIP on E-SCDD, compared to the SCDD dataset, improves pixel-level AUC and average precision by 1.70 and 8.34 points, respectively.

TL;DR: TomoGraphView is a novel framework for 3D medical image classification that uses omnidirectional volume slicing with spherical graph-based feature aggregation to better capture spatial relationships in volumetric data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing number of medical tomography exams requires automated methods for comprehensive feature extraction, but 3D medical image classification faces challenges due to complex spatial relationships and limited 3D datasets. Existing approaches using 2D foundation models with conventional slice-based decomposition are suboptimal.

Method: Proposes TomoGraphView framework that integrates omnidirectional volume slicing with spherical graph-based feature aggregation to better capture spatial extent of target structures and preserve volumetric structure.

Result: The authors provide an accessible code base and user-friendly library for omnidirectional volume slicing, but specific performance results are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: The proposed framework addresses limitations of conventional slice-based approaches by better capturing spatial coherence across slices through omnidirectional slicing and graph-based aggregation.

Abstract: The growing number of medical tomography examinations has necessitated the development of automated methods capable of extracting comprehensive imaging features to facilitate downstream tasks such as tumor characterization, while assisting physicians in managing their growing workload. However, 3D medical image classification remains a challenging task due to the complex spatial relationships and long-range dependencies inherent in volumetric data. Training models from scratch suffers from low data regimes, and the absence of 3D large-scale multimodal datasets has limited the development of 3D medical imaging foundation models. Recent studies, however, have highlighted the potential of 2D vision foundation models, originally trained on natural images, as powerful feature extractors for medical image analysis. Despite these advances, existing approaches that apply 2D models to 3D volumes via slice-based decomposition remain suboptimal. Conventional volume slicing strategies, which rely on canonical planes such as axial, sagittal, or coronal, may inadequately capture the spatial extent of target structures when these are misaligned with standardized viewing planes. Furthermore, existing slice-wise aggregation strategies rarely account for preserving the volumetric structure, resulting in a loss of spatial coherence across slices. To overcome these limitations, we propose TomoGraphView, a novel framework that integrates omnidirectional volume slicing with spherical graph-based feature aggregation. We publicly share our accessible code base at http://github.com/compai-lab/2025-MedIA-kiechle and provide a user-friendly library for omnidirectional volume slicing at https://pypi.org/project/OmniSlicer.

TL;DR: TempRetinex is an unsupervised Retinex-based video enhancement framework that leverages temporal information and adaptive preprocessing to improve robustness and temporal consistency in low-light conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Videos contain rich temporal information that can provide complementary cues for low-light enhancement beyond single images, but existing unsupervised methods have poor generalization under varying illumination conditions.

Method: The framework uses adaptive brightness adjustment (ABA) preprocessing, multi-scale temporal consistency-aware loss, occlusion-aware masking, reverse inference strategy, and self-ensemble mechanism to enhance temporal coherence and denoising performance.

Result: TempRetinex achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 29.7% PSNR gain over prior methods, demonstrating superior perceptual quality and temporal consistency.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively exploits inter-frame correlations and improves model robustness to diverse lighting scenarios, making it a powerful solution for unsupervised video enhancement in low-light conditions.

Abstract: Videos inherently contain rich temporal information that provides complementary cues for low-light enhancement beyond what can be achieved with single images. We propose TempRetinex, a novel unsupervised Retinex-based framework that effectively exploits inter-frame correlations for video enhancement. To address the poor generalization of existing unsupervised methods under varying illumination, we introduce adaptive brightness adjustment (ABA) preprocessing that explicitly aligns lighting distributions across exposures. This significantly improves model robustness to diverse lighting scenarios and eases training optimization, leading to better denoising performance. For enhanced temporal coherence, we propose a multi-scale temporal consistency-aware loss to enforce multiscale similarity between consecutive frames, and an occlusion-aware masking technique to handle complex motions. We further incorporate a reverse inference strategy to refine unconverged frames and a self-ensemble (SE) mechanism to boost the denoising across diverse textures. Experiments demonstrate that TempRetinex achieves state-of-the-art performance in both perceptual quality and temporal consistency, achieving up to a 29.7% PSNR gain over prior methods.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposes a global denoising model (GDM) for microscopy images that preserves weak but physically important features while removing artifacts, using a two-channel input approach with FFT-based loss function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing denoising models often erase weak but physically significant signals in microscopy images, and manual tuning of microscopy controls for high-quality images is time-consuming.

Method: Developed GDM with: 1) two-imaging input channel of non-pair pre-processed images with user-defined trade-off, 2) U-net model trained with pixel- and FFT-based loss function.

Result: Compared GDM with non-FFT denoising model on STM images of Cu/Si, AFM bio-film images, and SEM plastic degradation images, showing improved preservation of weak physical features.

Conclusion: The proposed workflow can be extended to improve other microscopy image quality and provides design flexibility for domain experts to tune according to their preferences.

Abstract: Microscopy such as Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) are essential tools in material imaging at micro- and nanoscale resolutions to extract physical knowledge and materials structure-property relationships. However, tuning microscopy controls (e.g. scanning speed, current setpoint, tip bias etc.) to obtain a high-quality of images is a non-trivial and time-consuming effort. On the other hand, with sub-standard images, the key features are not accurately discovered due to noise and artifacts, leading to erroneous analysis. Existing denoising models mostly build on generalizing the weak signals as noises while the strong signals are enhanced as key features, which is not always the case in microscopy images, thus can completely erase a significant amount of hidden physical information. To address these limitations, we propose a global denoising model (GDM) to smartly remove artifacts of microscopy images while preserving weaker but physically important features. The proposed model is developed based on 1) first designing a two-imaging input channel of non-pair and goal specific pre-processed images with user-defined trade-off information between two channels and 2) then integrating a loss function of pixel- and fast Fourier-transformed (FFT) based on training the U-net model. We compared the proposed GDM with the non-FFT denoising model over STM-generated images of Copper(Cu) and Silicon(Si) materials, AFM-generated Pantoea sp.YR343 bio-film images and SEM-generated plastic degradation images. We believe this proposed workflow can be extended to improve other microscopy image quality and will benefit the experimentalists with the proposed design flexibility to smartly tune via domain-experts preferences.

TL;DR: Proposes RMC-CC-CSI algorithm for electromagnetic inversion of moving targets using phase correlation registration and motion compensation with TDM-MIMO radar.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable accurate electromagnetic parameter reconstruction for translationally moving targets, overcoming limitations of conventional inversion methods designed for stationary targets.

Method: Uses phase correlation registration of back-projection images for high-precision relative positioning, then applies relative motion compensation to perform iterative inversion on multi-cycle MIMO data, integrating CC-CSI into the optimization.

Result: RMC-CC-CSI shows accelerated convergence, enhanced reconstruction fidelity, and improved noise immunity compared to conventional CC-CSI for stationary targets, though with increased computational cost.

Conclusion: The proposed scheme provides an effective framework for electromagnetic inversion of moving targets with superior performance over existing methods, demonstrating practical applicability through numerical and experimental validation.

Abstract: An novel electromagnetic quantitative inversion scheme for translationally moving targets via phase correlation registration of back-projection (BP) images is proposed. Based on a time division multiplexing multiple-input multiple-output (TDM-MIMO) radar architecture, the scheme first achieves high-precision relative positioning of the target, then applies relative motion compensation to perform iterative inversion on multi-cycle MIMO measurement data, thereby reconstructing the target's electromagnetic parameters. As a general framework compatible with other mainstream inversion algorithms, we exemplify our approach by incorporating the classical cross-correlated contrast source inversion (CC-CSI) into iterative optimization step of the scheme, resulting in a new algorithm termed RMC-CC-CSI. Numerical and experimental results demonstrate that RMC-CC-CSI offers accelerated convergence, enhanced reconstruction fidelity, and improved noise immunity over conventional CC-CSI for stationary targets despite increased computational cost.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A physics-informed data augmentation method using phase diversity to improve inverse problem solutions in optical imaging, enabling simpler reconstruction algorithms with high-quality results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse problems in imaging are ill-posed, and while deep learning approaches speed up reconstruction, they don't fundamentally address the ill-posedness. Additional measurements can improve robustness but require complex hardware setups.

Method: Use phase diverse measurements with implicit local correlation, create physics-informed data augmentation where a trained network generates phase diverse pseudo-data from ground truth, then use both real and augmented data for reconstruction.

Result: The approach provides high-quality inverse solutions with simpler reconstruction algorithms for both incoherent and coherent optical imaging, validated with vortex phase as diversity mechanism.

Conclusion: This method enables leaner high-fidelity computational imaging systems without requiring additional complex hardware setups.

Abstract: Inverse problems in imaging are typically ill-posed and are usually solved by employing regularized optimization techniques. The usage of appropriate constraints can restrict the solution space, thus making it feasible for a reconstruction algorithm to find a meaningful solution. In recent years, deep network based ideas aimed at learning the end-to-end mapping between the raw measurements and the target image have gained popularity. In the learning approach, the functional relationship between the measured raw data and the solution image are learned by training a deep network with prior examples. While this approach allows one to significantly increase the real-time operational speed, it does not change the nature of the underlying ill-posed inverse problem. It is well-known that availability of diverse non-redundant data via additional measurements can generically improve the robustness of the reconstruction algorithms. The multiple data measurements, however, typically demand additional hardware and complex system setups that are not desirable. In this work, we note that in both incoherent and coherent optical imaging, the irradiance patterns corresponding to two phase diverse measurements associated with the same test object have implicit local correlation which may be learned. A physics informed data augmentation scheme is then described where a trained network is used for generating a phase diverse pseudo-data based on a ground truth data frame. The true data along with the augmented pesudo-data are observed to provide high quality inverse solutions with simpler reconstruction algorithms. We validate this approach for both incoherent and coherent optical imaging (or phase retrieval) configurations with vortex phase as a diversity mechanism. Our results may open new avenues for leaner high-fidelity computational imaging systems across a broad range of applications.

TL;DR: The paper proposes ERED and EPnP frameworks that incorporate equivariance properties into image restoration using equivariant denoisers and stochastic optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most deep architectures don't represent invariant image distributions despite natural image distributions being invariant to transformations like rotations/flips. Recent Plug-and-Play methods have tried to include equivariance but need more unified approaches.

Method: Two frameworks: Equivariant Regularization by Denoising (ERED) and Equivariant Plug-and-Play (EPnP) based on equivariant denoisers and stochastic optimization.

Result: The authors analyze convergence of the proposed algorithms and discuss their practical benefits for image restoration.

Conclusion: The proposed equivariant frameworks provide a unified approach to incorporate transformation invariance into image restoration, addressing limitations of standard deep architectures.

Abstract: One key ingredient of image restoration is to define a realistic prior on clean images to complete the missing information in the observation. State-of-the-art restoration methods rely on a neural network to encode this prior. Typical image distributions are invariant to some set of transformations, such as rotations or flips. However, most deep architectures are not designed to represent an invariant image distribution. Recent works have proposed to overcome this difficulty by including equivariance properties within a Plug-and-Play paradigm. In this work, we propose two unified frameworks named Equivariant Regularization by Denoising (ERED) and Equivariant Plug-and-Play (EPnP) based on equivariant denoisers and stochastic optimization. We analyze the convergence of the proposed algorithms and discuss their practical benefit.

TL;DR: Proposes shallow discriminator architectures for pixel-level domain adaptation that improve learning of unknown image distortions by using smaller receptive fields to better reproduce local distortion characteristics with lower network complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Camera-specific image characteristics create domain gaps that degrade performance in learning-based perception algorithms when training and application data differ. Previous unpaired learning approaches for pristine-to-distorted mapping have limitations.

Method: Uses shallow discriminator architectures with smaller receptive field sizes to more accurately learn local distortion characteristics while maintaining low network complexity.

Result: Achieves mean average precision increases up to 0.15 for individual distortions and up to 0.16 for camera-specific characteristics in instance segmentation domain adaptation. Reduces complexity by factor of 20 compared to some state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates superior efficiency without compromising performance, effectively addressing domain gaps caused by camera-specific image characteristics through improved local distortion learning.

Abstract: Each image acquisition setup leads to its own camera-specific image characteristics degrading the image quality. In learning-based perception algorithms, characteristics occurring during the application phase, but absent in the training data, lead to a domain gap impeding the performance. Previously, pixel-level domain adaptation through unpaired learning of the pristine-to-distorted mapping function has been proposed. In this work, we propose shallow discriminator architectures to address limitations of these approaches. We show that a smaller receptive field size improves learning of unknown image distortions by more accurately reproducing local distortion characteristics at a low network complexity. In a domain adaptation setup for instance segmentation, we achieve mean average precision increases over previous methods of up to 0.15 for individual distortions and up to 0.16 for camera-specific image characteristics in a simplified camera model. In terms of number of parameters, our approach matches the complexity of one state of the art method while reducing complexity by a factor of 20 compared to another, demonstrating superior efficiency without compromising performance.
