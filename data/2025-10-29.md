*Aryan Mathur,Asaduddin Ahmed,Pushti Amit Vasoya,Simeon Kandan Sonar,Yasir Z,Madesh Kuppusamy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An explainable AI system that combines a lightweight CNN classifier with a Vision-Language Model to detect, localize, and explain visual artifacts in 32x32 images with 96.5% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of verifying visual authenticity due to increasingly realistic AI-generated imagery.

Method: Combines Faster-Than-Lies CNN classifier with Qwen2-VL-7B VLM, uses autoencoder-based reconstruction error maps for artifact localization, and categorizes 70 visual artifact types into 8 semantic groups.

Result: Achieves 96.5% accuracy on extended CiFAKE dataset with adversarial perturbations, maintains 175ms inference time on 8-core CPUs, and generates explainable text for detected anomalies.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of combining visual and linguistic reasoning for interpretable authenticity detection in low-resolution imagery, with potential applications in forensics, industrial inspection, and social media moderation.

Abstract: The increasing realism of AI-generated imagery poses challenges for verifying
visual authenticity. We present an explainable image authenticity detection
system that combines a lightweight convolutional classifier
("Faster-Than-Lies") with a Vision-Language Model (Qwen2-VL-7B) to classify,
localize, and explain artifacts in 32x32 images. Our model achieves 96.5%
accuracy on the extended CiFAKE dataset augmented with adversarial
perturbations and maintains an inference time of 175ms on 8-core CPUs, enabling
deployment on local or edge devices. Using autoencoder-based reconstruction
error maps, we generate artifact localization heatmaps, which enhance
interpretability for both humans and the VLM. We further categorize 70 visual
artifact types into eight semantic groups and demonstrate explainable text
generation for each detected anomaly. This work highlights the feasibility of
combining visual and linguistic reasoning for interpretable authenticity
detection in low-resolution imagery and outlines potential cross-domain
applications in forensics, industrial inspection, and social media moderation.

### [2] [CountFormer: A Transformer Framework for Learning Visual Repetition and Structure in Class-Agnostic Object Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23785)
*Md Tanvir Hossain,Akif Islam,Mohd Ruhul Ameen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CountFormer is a transformer-based framework for class-agnostic object counting that uses DINOv2 for richer feature representations and achieves state-of-the-art performance on structurally complex scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans can count objects by perceiving visual repetition and structural relationships, but most existing counting models fail to replicate this ability, especially with complex shapes, internal symmetry, or overlapping objects.

Method: Built on CounTR architecture, replaces visual encoder with self-supervised DINOv2 foundation model, incorporates positional embedding fusion to preserve geometric relationships, and uses lightweight convolutional decoder to generate density maps.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods on FSC-147 dataset, with superior accuracy on structurally intricate or densely packed scenes.

Conclusion: Integrating foundation models like DINOv2 enables counting systems to approach human-like structural perception, advancing toward truly general and exemplar-free counting.

Abstract: Humans can effortlessly count diverse objects by perceiving visual repetition
and structural relationships rather than relying on class identity. However,
most existing counting models fail to replicate this ability; they often
miscount when objects exhibit complex shapes, internal symmetry, or overlapping
components. In this work, we introduce CountFormer, a transformer-based
framework that learns to recognize repetition and structural coherence for
class-agnostic object counting. Built upon the CounTR architecture, our model
replaces its visual encoder with the self-supervised foundation model DINOv2,
which produces richer and spatially consistent feature representations. We
further incorporate positional embedding fusion to preserve geometric
relationships before decoding these features into density maps through a
lightweight convolutional decoder. Evaluated on the FSC-147 dataset, our model
achieves performance comparable to current state-of-the-art methods while
demonstrating superior accuracy on structurally intricate or densely packed
scenes. Our findings indicate that integrating foundation models such as DINOv2
enables counting systems to approach human-like structural perception,
advancing toward a truly general and exemplar-free counting paradigm.

*Gauthier Grimmer,Romain Wenger,Clément Flint,Germain Forestier,Gilles Rixhon,Valentin Chardon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework using fixed cameras and deep learning for continuous monitoring of floating debris in rivers, with geometric modeling for object size estimation and analysis of data leakage biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the environmental concern of floating anthropogenic debris in rivers that negatively impacts biodiversity, water quality, navigation, and recreation.

Method: Utilizes fixed in-situ cameras with deep learning models for debris detection and quantification, implements geometric model for object size estimation from 2D images using camera characteristics, and tests models under various environmental conditions including data leakage experiments.

Result: Identifies most suitable deep learning models for accuracy and speed in complex conditions, demonstrates significance of dataset protocol with negative images and temporal leakage considerations, and shows feasibility of metric object estimation using projective geometry with regression corrections.

Conclusion: The approach enables development of robust, low-cost automated monitoring systems for urban aquatic environments through camera-based deep learning and geometric modeling.

Abstract: The proliferation of floating anthropogenic debris in rivers has emerged as a
pressing environmental concern, exerting a detrimental influence on
biodiversity, water quality, and human activities such as navigation and
recreation. The present study proposes a novel methodological framework for the
monitoring the aforementioned waste, utilising fixed, in-situ cameras. This
study provides two key contributions: (i) the continuous quantification and
monitoring of floating debris using deep learning and (ii) the identification
of the most suitable deep learning model in terms of accuracy and inference
speed under complex environmental conditions. These models are tested in a
range of environmental conditions and learning configurations, including
experiments on biases related to data leakage. Furthermore, a geometric model
is implemented to estimate the actual size of detected objects from a 2D image.
This model takes advantage of both intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics of
the camera. The findings of this study underscore the significance of the
dataset constitution protocol, particularly with respect to the integration of
negative images and the consideration of temporal leakage. In conclusion, the
feasibility of metric object estimation using projective geometry coupled with
regression corrections is demonstrated. This approach paves the way for the
development of robust, low-cost, automated monitoring systems for urban aquatic
environments.

### [4] [RareFlow: Physics-Aware Flow-Matching for Cross-Sensor Super-Resolution of Rare-Earth Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23816)
*Forouzan Fallah,Wenwen Li,Chia-Yu Hsu,Hyunho Lee,Yezhou Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RareFlow is a physics-aware super-resolution framework that addresses out-of-distribution robustness for remote sensing imagery through dual-conditioning architecture and uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Super-resolution for remote sensing imagery often fails under out-of-distribution conditions, producing visually plausible but physically inaccurate results, especially for rare geomorphic features captured by diverse sensors.

Method: Uses dual-conditioning architecture with Gated ControlNet for geometric fidelity and textual prompts for semantic guidance. Introduces multifaceted loss function for spectral/radiometric consistency and employs stochastic forward pass for uncertainty quantification.

Result: In blind evaluations, geophysical experts rated outputs approaching ground truth fidelity, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines with nearly 40% reduction in FID and qualitative superiority.

Conclusion: RareFlow provides a robust framework for high-fidelity synthesis in data-scarce scientific domains and offers a new paradigm for controlled generation under severe domain shift.

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) for remote sensing imagery often fails under
out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions, such as rare geomorphic features captured
by diverse sensors, producing visually plausible but physically inaccurate
results. We present RareFlow, a physics-aware SR framework designed for OOD
robustness. RareFlow's core is a dual-conditioning architecture. A Gated
ControlNet preserves fine-grained geometric fidelity from the low-resolution
input, while textual prompts provide semantic guidance for synthesizing complex
features. To ensure physically sound outputs, we introduce a multifaceted loss
function that enforces both spectral and radiometric consistency with sensor
properties. Furthermore, the framework quantifies its own predictive
uncertainty by employing a stochastic forward pass approach; the resulting
output variance directly identifies unfamiliar inputs, mitigating feature
hallucination. We validate RareFlow on a new, curated benchmark of multi-sensor
satellite imagery. In blind evaluations, geophysical experts rated our model's
outputs as approaching the fidelity of ground truth imagery, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. This qualitative superiority is
corroborated by quantitative gains in perceptual metrics, including a nearly
40\% reduction in FID. RareFlow provides a robust framework for high-fidelity
synthesis in data-scarce scientific domains and offers a new paradigm for
controlled generation under severe domain shift.

### [5] [TRELLISWorld: Training-Free World Generation from Object Generators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23880)
*Hanke Chen,Yuan Liu,Minchen Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free method for 3D scene generation that repurposes text-to-3D object diffusion models as modular tile generators, enabling scalable synthesis of large, coherent scenes through multi-tile denoising and seamless blending.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D scene generation methods are limited to single-object generation, require domain-specific training, or lack full 360-degree viewability, creating a need for more flexible and scalable approaches.

Method: Reformulates scene generation as a multi-tile denoising problem where overlapping 3D regions are independently generated using text-to-3D object diffusion models and seamlessly blended via weighted averaging.

Result: The approach enables scalable synthesis of large, coherent scenes while preserving local semantic control, supports diverse scene layouts, efficient generation, and flexible editing without requiring scene-level datasets or retraining.

Conclusion: Establishes a simple yet powerful foundation for general-purpose, language-driven 3D scene construction by leveraging object-level priors and eliminating the need for scene-specific training.

Abstract: Text-driven 3D scene generation holds promise for a wide range of
applications, from virtual prototyping to AR/VR and simulation. However,
existing methods are often constrained to single-object generation, require
domain-specific training, or lack support for full 360-degree viewability. In
this work, we present a training-free approach to 3D scene synthesis by
repurposing general-purpose text-to-3D object diffusion models as modular tile
generators. We reformulate scene generation as a multi-tile denoising problem,
where overlapping 3D regions are independently generated and seamlessly blended
via weighted averaging. This enables scalable synthesis of large, coherent
scenes while preserving local semantic control. Our method eliminates the need
for scene-level datasets or retraining, relies on minimal heuristics, and
inherits the generalization capabilities of object-level priors. We demonstrate
that our approach supports diverse scene layouts, efficient generation, and
flexible editing, establishing a simple yet powerful foundation for
general-purpose, language-driven 3D scene construction.

### [6] [Improving Visual Discriminability of CLIP for Training-Free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23894)
*Jinxin Zhou,Jiachen Jiang,Zhihui Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LHT-CLIP is a training-free framework that improves CLIP for semantic segmentation by exploiting visual discriminability across layers, attention heads, and tokens without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP models struggle with semantic segmentation due to misalignment between image-level pre-training and pixel-level dense prediction requirements, inheriting global alignment bias that leads to suboptimal performance.

Method: Proposes three techniques: semantic-spatial reweighting, selective head enhancement, and abnormal token replacement to restore visual discriminability without training, based on analysis of layer behavior, attention head patterns, and token characteristics.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 8 semantic segmentation benchmarks across diverse scenarios, demonstrating effectiveness without additional training, auxiliary networks, or extensive hyperparameter tuning.

Conclusion: LHT-CLIP effectively bridges the gap between CLIP's pre-training and segmentation requirements through systematic exploitation of visual discriminability, offering a practical solution for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Extending CLIP models to semantic segmentation remains challenging due to the
misalignment between their image-level pre-training objectives and the
pixel-level visual understanding required for dense prediction. While prior
efforts have achieved encouraging results by reorganizing the final layer and
features, they often inherit the global alignment bias of preceding layers,
leading to suboptimal segmentation performance. In this work, we propose
LHT-CLIP, a novel training-free framework that systematically exploits the
visual discriminability of CLIP across layer, head, and token levels. Through
comprehensive analysis, we reveal three key insights: (i) the final layers
primarily strengthen image-text alignment with sacrifice of visual
discriminability (e.g., last 3 layers in ViT-B/16 and 8 layers in ViT-L/14),
partly due to the emergence of anomalous tokens; (ii) a subset of attention
heads (e.g., 10 out of 144 in ViT-B/16) display consistently strong visual
discriminability across datasets; (iii) abnormal tokens display sparse and
consistent activation pattern compared to normal tokens. Based on these
findings, we propose three complementary techniques: semantic-spatial
reweighting, selective head enhancement, and abnormal token replacement to
effectively restore visual discriminability and improve segmentation
performance without any additional training, auxiliary pre-trained networks, or
extensive hyperparameter tuning. Extensive experiments on 8 common semantic
segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that LHT-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art
performance across diverse scenarios, highlighting its effectiveness and
practicality for real-world deployment.

### [7] [DynaStride: Dynamic Stride Windowing with MMCoT for Instructional Multi-Scene Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23907)
*Eddison Pham,Prisha Priyadarshini,Adrian Maliackel,Kanishk Bandi,Cristian Meo,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DynaStride is a pipeline that generates coherent scene-level captions for instructional videos without manual scene segmentation, using adaptive frame sampling and multimodal reasoning to improve caption quality and temporal coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scene-level captioning in instructional videos enhances learning by understanding visual cues and temporal structure, but current methods often fail to capture this structure, leading to incoherent captions that undermine educational value.

Method: Uses adaptive frame sampling and multimodal windowing on YouCookII dataset, employs multimodal chain-of-thought to generate action-object pairs, and refines them with dynamic stride window selection algorithm to balance temporal context and redundancy.

Result: Outperforms strong baselines (VLLaMA3, GPT-4o) on both N-gram metrics (BLEU, METEOR) and semantic similarity measures (BERTScore, CLIPScore), producing more temporally coherent and informative captions.

Conclusion: DynaStride shows promising direction for improving AI-powered instructional content generation by effectively integrating visual semantics and temporal reasoning in scene-level captions.

Abstract: Scene-level captioning in instructional videos can enhance learning by
requiring an understanding of both visual cues and temporal structure. By
aligning visual cues with textual guidance, this understanding supports
procedural learning and multimodal reasoning, providing a richer context for
skill acquisition. However, captions that fail to capture this structure may
lack coherence and quality, which can create confusion and undermine the
video's educational intent. To address this gap, we introduce DynaStride, a
pipeline to generate coherent, scene-level captions without requiring manual
scene segmentation. Using the YouCookII dataset's scene annotations, DynaStride
performs adaptive frame sampling and multimodal windowing to capture key
transitions within each scene. It then employs a multimodal chain-of-thought
process to produce multiple action-object pairs, which are refined and fused
using a dynamic stride window selection algorithm that adaptively balances
temporal context and redundancy. The final scene-level caption integrates
visual semantics and temporal reasoning in a single instructional caption.
Empirical evaluations against strong baselines, including VLLaMA3 and GPT-4o,
demonstrate consistent gains on both N-gram-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR) and
semantic similarity measures (BERTScore, CLIPScore). Qualitative analyses
further show that DynaStride produces captions that are more temporally
coherent and informative, suggesting a promising direction for improving
AI-powered instructional content generation.

### [8] [TurboPortrait3D: Single-step diffusion-based fast portrait novel-view synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23929)
*Emily Kim,Julieta Martinez,Timur Bagautdinov,Jessica Hodgins*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TurboPortrait3D is a method for low-latency novel-view synthesis of human portraits that enhances existing image-to-3D models using diffusion models to improve quality while maintaining 3D awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image-to-3D portrait models produce visual artifacts, lack detail, and fail to preserve subject identity, while diffusion models generate high-quality images but lack 3D consistency and are computationally expensive.

Method: Uses a feedforward image-to-avatar pipeline to get initial 3D representation and noisy renders, then applies a single-step diffusion model conditioned on input images to refine renders with multi-view consistency. Training includes pre-training on synthetic multi-view data and fine-tuning on real images.

Result: Qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art for portrait novel-view synthesis while being efficient in time.

Conclusion: Image-space diffusion models can significantly enhance image-to-avatar methods, maintaining 3D-awareness and running with low latency for high-quality portrait novel-view synthesis.

Abstract: We introduce TurboPortrait3D: a method for low-latency novel-view synthesis
of human portraits. Our approach builds on the observation that existing
image-to-3D models for portrait generation, while capable of producing
renderable 3D representations, are prone to visual artifacts, often lack of
detail, and tend to fail at fully preserving the identity of the subject. On
the other hand, image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images,
but besides being computationally expensive, are not grounded in 3D and thus
are not directly capable of producing multi-view consistent outputs. In this
work, we demonstrate that image-space diffusion models can be used to
significantly enhance the quality of existing image-to-avatar methods, while
maintaining 3D-awareness and running with low-latency. Our method takes a
single frontal image of a subject as input, and applies a feedforward
image-to-avatar generation pipeline to obtain an initial 3D representation and
corresponding noisy renders. These noisy renders are then fed to a single-step
diffusion model which is conditioned on input image(s), and is specifically
trained to refine the renders in a multi-view consistent way. Moreover, we
introduce a novel effective training strategy that includes pre-training on a
large corpus of synthetic multi-view data, followed by fine-tuning on
high-quality real images. We demonstrate that our approach both qualitatively
and quantitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art for portrait novel-view
synthesis, while being efficient in time.

### [9] [PlanarGS: High-Fidelity Indoor 3D Gaussian Splatting Guided by Vision-Language Planar Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23930)
*Xirui Jin,Renbiao Jin,Boying Li,Danping Zou,Wenxian Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PlanarGS improves 3D Gaussian Splatting for indoor scenes by incorporating planar priors and geometric supervision to address ambiguous geometry in low-texture regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS struggles with ambiguous geometry in large, low-texture indoor scenes due to reliance on photometric loss alone.

Method: Uses Language-Prompted Planar Priors (LP3) with vision-language segmentation, cross-view fusion, and adds planar consistency and geometric supervision terms to Gaussian optimization.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on indoor benchmarks, reconstructing accurate and detailed 3D surfaces.

Conclusion: PlanarGS effectively enhances 3DGS for indoor scene reconstruction by integrating planar and geometric priors.

Abstract: Three-dimensional Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as an
efficient representation for novel-view synthesis, achieving impressive visual
quality. However, in scenes dominated by large and low-texture regions, common
in indoor environments, the photometric loss used to optimize 3DGS yields
ambiguous geometry and fails to recover high-fidelity 3D surfaces. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce PlanarGS, a 3DGS-based framework tailored for
indoor scene reconstruction. Specifically, we design a pipeline for
Language-Prompted Planar Priors (LP3) that employs a pretrained vision-language
segmentation model and refines its region proposals via cross-view fusion and
inspection with geometric priors. 3D Gaussians in our framework are optimized
with two additional terms: a planar prior supervision term that enforces planar
consistency, and a geometric prior supervision term that steers the Gaussians
toward the depth and normal cues. We have conducted extensive experiments on
standard indoor benchmarks. The results show that PlanarGS reconstructs
accurate and detailed 3D surfaces, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by a large margin. Project page: https://planargs.github.io

### [10] [Adaptive Training of INRs via Pruning and Densification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23943)
*Diana Aldana,João Paulo Lima,Daniel Csillag,Daniel Perazzo,Haoan Feng,Luiz Velho,Tiago Novello*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AIRe is an adaptive training scheme for implicit neural representations that refines network architecture through neuron pruning and input frequency densification to optimize the trade-off between model size and reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for implicit neural representations require manual selection of input frequencies and architectures, leading to parameter redundancy and heavy hyperparameter optimization. There's a need for adaptive approaches that can automatically optimize network structure during training.

Method: AIRe uses a two-stage approach: 1) Neuron pruning that identifies less-contributory neurons, applies targeted weight decay to transfer information, then performs structured pruning; 2) Input frequency densification that adds frequencies to spectrum regions where the signal underfits.

Result: Experiments on images and SDFs show that AIRe reduces model size while preserving or even improving reconstruction quality compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: AIRe provides an effective adaptive training scheme that automatically optimizes implicit neural representation architectures, achieving better parameter efficiency and representation quality without extensive manual hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: Encoding input coordinates with sinusoidal functions into multilayer
perceptrons (MLPs) has proven effective for implicit neural representations
(INRs) of low-dimensional signals, enabling the modeling of high-frequency
details. However, selecting appropriate input frequencies and architectures
while managing parameter redundancy remains an open challenge, often addressed
through heuristics and heavy hyperparameter optimization schemes. In this
paper, we introduce AIRe ($\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{I}$mplicit neural
$\textbf{Re}$presentation), an adaptive training scheme that refines the INR
architecture over the course of optimization. Our method uses a neuron pruning
mechanism to avoid redundancy and input frequency densification to improve
representation capacity, leading to an improved trade-off between network size
and reconstruction quality. For pruning, we first identify less-contributory
neurons and apply a targeted weight decay to transfer their information to the
remaining neurons, followed by structured pruning. Next, the densification
stage adds input frequencies to spectrum regions where the signal underfits,
expanding the representational basis. Through experiments on images and SDFs,
we show that AIRe reduces model size while preserving, or even improving,
reconstruction quality. Code and pretrained models will be released for public
use.

### [11] [Neural USD: An object-centric framework for iterative editing and control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23956)
*Alejandro Escontrela,Shrinu Kushagra,Sjoerd van Steenkiste,Yulia Rubanova,Aleksander Holynski,Kelsey Allen,Kevin Murphy,Thomas Kipf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Neural USD introduces a hierarchical scene representation framework inspired by Universal Scene Descriptor (USD) to enable precise per-object editing in generative models while preventing unintended global changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current controllable generative models struggle with precise and iterative object editing, often causing unintended global changes when trying to modify specific objects or backgrounds.

Method: Proposes Neural USD framework with structured hierarchical scene representation, accommodating diverse signals and applying fine-tuning to disentangle control signals for appearance, geometry, and pose.

Result: The framework enables iterative and incremental workflows with per-object control, demonstrating effective disentanglement of control signals.

Conclusion: Neural USD addresses key challenges in precise object editing for generative models through structured hierarchical representation inspired by computer graphics standards.

Abstract: Amazing progress has been made in controllable generative modeling,
especially over the last few years. However, some challenges remain. One of
them is precise and iterative object editing. In many of the current methods,
trying to edit the generated image (for example, changing the color of a
particular object in the scene or changing the background while keeping other
elements unchanged) by changing the conditioning signals often leads to
unintended global changes in the scene. In this work, we take the first steps
to address the above challenges. Taking inspiration from the Universal Scene
Descriptor (USD) standard developed in the computer graphics community, we
introduce the "Neural Universal Scene Descriptor" or Neural USD. In this
framework, we represent scenes and objects in a structured, hierarchical
manner. This accommodates diverse signals, minimizes model-specific
constraints, and enables per-object control over appearance, geometry, and
pose. We further apply a fine-tuning approach which ensures that the above
control signals are disentangled from one another. We evaluate several design
considerations for our framework, demonstrating how Neural USD enables
iterative and incremental workflows. More information at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SafeVision is a novel image guardrail system that integrates human-like reasoning to enhance adaptability and transparency, achieving state-of-the-art performance while being 16x faster than GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image guardrail models are constrained by predefined categories, misclassify content due to lack of semantic reasoning, and struggle to adapt to emerging threats requiring costly retraining.

Method: Incorporates data collection/generation framework, policy-following training pipeline, customized loss function, and diverse QA generation strategy. Dynamically aligns with safety policies at inference time without retraining.

Result: Outperforms GPT-4o by 8.6% on VisionHarm-T and 15.5% on VisionHarm-C benchmarks while being over 16x faster. Introduces VisionHarm dataset with comprehensive harmful categories.

Conclusion: SafeVision sets a comprehensive, policy-following, and explainable image guardrail with dynamic adaptation to emerging threats, eliminating the need for retraining.

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of digital media, the need for efficient and
transparent safeguards against unsafe content is more critical than ever.
Traditional image guardrail models, constrained by predefined categories, often
misclassify content due to their pure feature-based learning without semantic
reasoning. Moreover, these models struggle to adapt to emerging threats,
requiring costly retraining for new threats. To address these limitations, we
introduce SafeVision, a novel image guardrail that integrates human-like
reasoning to enhance adaptability and transparency. Our approach incorporates
an effective data collection and generation framework, a policy-following
training pipeline, and a customized loss function. We also propose a diverse QA
generation and training strategy to enhance learning effectiveness. SafeVision
dynamically aligns with evolving safety policies at inference time, eliminating
the need for retraining while ensuring precise risk assessments and
explanations. Recognizing the limitations of existing unsafe image benchmarks,
which either lack granularity or cover limited risks, we introduce VisionHarm,
a high-quality dataset comprising two subsets: VisionHarm Third-party
(VisionHarm-T) and VisionHarm Comprehensive(VisionHarm-C), spanning diverse
harmful categories. Through extensive experiments, we show that SafeVision
achieves state-of-the-art performance on different benchmarks. SafeVision
outperforms GPT-4o by 8.6% on VisionHarm-T and by 15.5% on VisionHarm-C, while
being over 16x faster. SafeVision sets a comprehensive, policy-following, and
explainable image guardrail with dynamic adaptation to emerging threats.

*Andriy Myronenko,Dong Yang,Baris Turkbey,Mariam Aboian,Sena Azamat,Esra Akcicek,Hongxu Yin,Pavlo Molchanov,Marc Edgar,Yufan He,Pengfei Guo,Yucheng Tang,Daguang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework that brings chain-of-thought reasoning to chest X-ray interpretation, making AI predictions more transparent and clinically interpretable by aligning with radiologists' systematic reasoning process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models for medical imaging are opaque and lack the transparent, stepwise reasoning that clinicians rely on for diagnosis and decision-making.

Method: Combines high-fidelity visual encoding with two-stage training: reasoning-style supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning using verifiable rewards over X-ray abnormalities.

Result: Achieves competitive multi-label classification in out-of-distribution evaluation while improving interpretability. In reader studies, reasoning traces increased radiologist confidence, supported error auditing, and reduced report finalization time.

Conclusion: The approach enables trustworthy, explainable AI in medical imaging where reasoning quality is as critical as prediction quality, supporting safer human-AI collaboration and clinical auditability.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong promise for medical image
analysis, but most remain opaque, offering predictions without the transparent,
stepwise reasoning clinicians rely on. We present a framework that brings
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to chest X-ray interpretation. Inspired by
reasoning-first training paradigms, our approach is designed to learn how
experts reason, not just what they conclude, by aligning intermediate steps
with observable image evidence and radiology workflow. Beyond accuracy, the
explicit reasoning traces support clinical auditability: they reveal why a
conclusion was reached, which alternatives were considered, and where
uncertainty remains, enabling quality assurance, error analysis, and safer
human-AI collaboration.
  Our model couples high-fidelity visual encoding with a two-stage training
recipe: a reasoning-style supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by
reinforcement learning (RL) that uses verifiable rewards over a list of X-ray
abnormalities. The model outputs reasoning that mirrors radiologists systematic
thought process, uncertainty, and differential diagnosis. In
out-of-distribution evaluation, the approach achieves competitive multi-label
classification while improving interpretability. In a reader study with expert
radiologists, full reasoning traces increased confidence, supported error
auditing, and reduced time to finalize reports. We release code and the model
NV-Reason-CXR-3B to support community progress toward trustworthy, explainable
AI in chest radiography and other medical imaging tasks where reasoning quality
is as critical as prediction quality.

*Kazutoshi Akita,Norimichi Ukita*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes joint prediction of multiple Fourier components for better quality and efficiency in arbitrary-scale super-resolution, addressing limitations of existing recurrent methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use recurrent neural networks to predict Fourier components one by one, causing performance degradation and inefficiency due to independent prediction.

Method: Predict multiple Fourier components jointly instead of one by one.

Result: Improves both quality and efficiency in arbitrary-scale super-resolution.

Conclusion: Joint prediction of multiple components is more effective than independent sequential prediction for cost-and-quality controllable super-resolution.

Abstract: Cost-and-Quality (CQ) controllability in arbitrary-scale super-resolution is
crucial. Existing methods predict Fourier components one by one using a
recurrent neural network. However, this approach leads to performance
degradation and inefficiency due to independent prediction. This paper proposes
predicting multiple components jointly to improve both quality and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks evaluate AI assistant capabilities in isolation, lack realistic streaming scenarios, or only support short-term tasks, failing to capture the real-world requirements of egocentric AI assistants.

Method: Created a dataset with over 14 hours per participant of synchronized egocentric video, audio, and text across four domains, aligned on a unified global timeline with human-refined visual narrations and speech transcripts. Includes 3,291 human-verified QA items across multiple formats evaluated in streaming settings.

Conclusion: TeleEgo provides a realistic and comprehensive evaluation framework to advance the development of practical AI assistants that can handle multi-modal inputs, respond in real time, and retain evolving long-term memory.

Abstract: Egocentric AI assistants in real-world settings must process multi-modal
inputs (video, audio, text), respond in real time, and retain evolving
long-term memory. However, existing benchmarks typically evaluate these
abilities in isolation, lack realistic streaming scenarios, or support only
short-term tasks. We introduce \textbf{TeleEgo}, a long-duration, streaming,
omni-modal benchmark for evaluating egocentric AI assistants in realistic daily
contexts. The dataset features over 14 hours per participant of synchronized
egocentric video, audio, and text across four domains: work \& study, lifestyle
\& routines, social activities, and outings \& culture. All data is aligned on
a unified global timeline and includes high-quality visual narrations and
speech transcripts, curated through human refinement.TeleEgo defines 12
diagnostic subtasks across three core capabilities: Memory (recalling past
events), Understanding (interpreting the current moment), and Cross-Memory
Reasoning (linking distant events). It contains 3,291 human-verified QA items
spanning multiple question formats (single-choice, binary, multi-choice, and
open-ended), evaluated strictly in a streaming setting. We propose two key
metrics -- Real-Time Accuracy and Memory Persistence Time -- to jointly assess
correctness, temporal responsiveness, and long-term retention. TeleEgo provides
a realistic and comprehensive evaluation to advance the development of
practical AI assistants.

TL;DR: Proposes AdvBlur, a novel diabetic retinopathy classification method that uses adversarial blurred images and dual-loss functions to improve domain generalization across different datasets and imaging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing deep learning models for diabetic retinopathy detection that struggle with robustness due to distributional variations from different acquisition devices, demographic disparities, and imaging conditions.

Method: Integrates adversarial blurred images into datasets and employs a dual-loss function framework to enhance domain generalization capabilities.

Result: Achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art domain generalization DR models on unseen external datasets, effectively mitigating impact of distributional variations.

Conclusion: AdvBlur method successfully addresses domain generalization challenges in diabetic retinopathy classification and demonstrates effectiveness across multiple datasets with varying conditions.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss worldwide, yet
early and accurate detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes.
While numerous Deep learning (DL) models have been developed to predict DR from
fundus images, many face challenges in maintaining robustness due to
distributional variations caused by differences in acquisition devices,
demographic disparities, and imaging conditions. This paper addresses this
critical limitation by proposing a novel DR classification approach, a method
called AdvBlur. Our method integrates adversarial blurred images into the
dataset and employs a dual-loss function framework to address domain
generalization. This approach effectively mitigates the impact of unseen
distributional variations, as evidenced by comprehensive evaluations across
multiple datasets. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to explore
the effects of factors such as camera type, low-quality images, and dataset
size. Furthermore, we perform ablation studies on blurred images and the loss
function to ensure the validity of our choices. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art domain generalization DR models on
unseen external datasets.

Abstract: The automated analysis of the aortic vessel tree (AVT) from computed
tomography angiography (CTA) holds immense clinical potential, but its
development has been impeded by a lack of shared, high-quality data. We
launched the SEG.A. challenge to catalyze progress in this field by introducing
a large, publicly available, multi-institutional dataset for AVT segmentation.
The challenge benchmarked automated algorithms on a hidden test set, with
subsequent optional tasks in surface meshing for computational simulations. Our
findings reveal a clear convergence on deep learning methodologies, with 3D
U-Net architectures dominating the top submissions. A key result was that an
ensemble of the highest-ranking algorithms significantly outperformed
individual models, highlighting the benefits of model fusion. Performance was
strongly linked to algorithmic design, particularly the use of customized
post-processing steps, and the characteristics of the training data. This
initiative not only establishes a new performance benchmark but also provides a
lasting resource to drive future innovation toward robust, clinically

TL;DR: Mars-Bench is the first standardized benchmark for evaluating foundation models on Mars science tasks, addressing the lack of systematic evaluation frameworks in this domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mars science lacks standardized benchmarks and evaluation frameworks that have enabled progress in other domains using foundation models, limiting the development of specialized models for Martian tasks.

Method: Created Mars-Bench with 20 datasets spanning classification, segmentation, and object detection tasks focused on key geologic features using orbital and surface imagery. Provided standardized datasets and baseline evaluations using various pre-trained models.

Result: Results suggest Mars-specific foundation models may offer advantages over general-domain counterparts, indicating potential benefits of domain-adapted pre-training for Mars science.

Conclusion: Mars-Bench establishes a standardized foundation for developing and comparing machine learning models for Mars science, enabling systematic progress in this domain.

Abstract: Foundation models have enabled rapid progress across many specialized domains
by leveraging large-scale pre-training on unlabeled data, demonstrating strong
generalization to a variety of downstream tasks. While such models have gained
significant attention in fields like Earth Observation, their application to
Mars science remains limited. A key enabler of progress in other domains has
been the availability of standardized benchmarks that support systematic
evaluation. In contrast, Mars science lacks such benchmarks and standardized
evaluation frameworks, which have limited progress toward developing foundation
models for Martian tasks. To address this gap, we introduce Mars-Bench, the
first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate models across a broad range
of Mars-related tasks using both orbital and surface imagery. Mars-Bench
comprises 20 datasets spanning classification, segmentation, and object
detection, focused on key geologic features such as craters, cones, boulders,
and frost. We provide standardized, ready-to-use datasets and baseline
evaluations using models pre-trained on natural images, Earth satellite data,
and state-of-the-art vision-language models. Results from all analyses suggest
that Mars-specific foundation models may offer advantages over general-domain
counterparts, motivating further exploration of domain-adapted pre-training.
Mars-Bench aims to establish a standardized foundation for developing and
comparing machine learning models for Mars science. Our data, models, and code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APT is a black-box framework that uses LLMs to generate human-readable adversarial suffixes for T2I models, bypassing safety filters through dual-evasion strategy and achieving high transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current red-teaming methods for T2I models require white-box access, use inefficient optimization, and generate meaningless prompts that are easily blocked by filters.

Method: Uses alternating optimization-finetuning pipeline between adversarial suffix optimization and LLM fine-tuning, with dual-evasion strategy including perplexity-based filtering and banned-token penalties.

Result: Excellent red-teaming performance with human-readable, filter-resistant prompts, and superior zero-shot transferability to unseen prompts and commercial APIs.

Conclusion: APT effectively exposes critical vulnerabilities in T2I models, including commercial systems, through human-readable adversarial prompts that bypass safety mechanisms.

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in text-to-image (T2I) models, their safety
mechanisms are vulnerable to adversarial prompts, which maliciously generate
unsafe images. Current red-teaming methods for proactively assessing such
vulnerabilities usually require white-box access to T2I models, and rely on
inefficient per-prompt optimization, as well as inevitably generate
semantically meaningless prompts easily blocked by filters. In this paper, we
propose APT (AutoPrompT), a black-box framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to automatically generate human-readable adversarial suffixes for
benign prompts. We first introduce an alternating optimization-finetuning
pipeline between adversarial suffix optimization and fine-tuning the LLM
utilizing the optimized suffix. Furthermore, we integrates a dual-evasion
strategy in optimization phase, enabling the bypass of both perplexity-based
filter and blacklist word filter: (1) we constrain the LLM generating
human-readable prompts through an auxiliary LLM perplexity scoring, which
starkly contrasts with prior token-level gibberish, and (2) we also introduce
banned-token penalties to suppress the explicit generation of banned-tokens in
blacklist. Extensive experiments demonstrate the excellent red-teaming
performance of our human-readable, filter-resistant adversarial prompts, as
well as superior zero-shot transferability which enables instant adaptation to
unseen prompts and exposes critical vulnerabilities even in commercial APIs
(e.g., Leonardo.Ai.).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vanishing gradient problem that prevents training of very deep convolutional neural networks.

Method: Uses residual blocks with skip connections that bypass intermediate layers, allowing gradients to flow directly through shortcut paths.

Result: ResNet-18 achieved 89.9% accuracy on CIFAR-10 vs 84.1% for traditional CNN, with faster convergence and more stable training.

Conclusion: Residual Networks successfully enable training of very deep networks by solving the vanishing gradient problem through skip connections.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has revolutionized computer vision, but
training very deep networks has been challenging due to the vanishing gradient
problem. This paper explores Residual Networks (ResNet), introduced by He et
al. (2015), which overcomes this limitation by using skip connections. ResNet
enables the training of networks with hundreds of layers by allowing gradients
to flow directly through shortcut connections that bypass intermediate layers.
In our implementation on the CIFAR-10 dataset, ResNet-18 achieves 89.9%
accuracy compared to 84.1% for a traditional deep CNN of similar depth, while
also converging faster and training more stably.

### [21] [Kernelized Sparse Fine-Tuning with Bi-level Parameter Competition for Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24037)
*Shufan Shen,Junshu Sun,Shuhui Wang,Qingming Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SNELLA is a one-stage parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that uses nonlinear kernel functions and adaptive bi-level sparsity allocation to achieve state-of-the-art performance with low memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sparse tuning methods have two limitations: they overlook parameter adjustments during fine-tuning and have high memory usage due to storing all weight matrices in the optimizer.

Method: SNELLA selectively updates weights using sparse matrices merged from low-rank learnable matrices with nonlinear kernel functions, and employs adaptive bi-level sparsity allocation to locate task-relevant weights end-to-end.

Result: SNELLA achieves 1.8% higher Top-1 accuracy on FGVC benchmark (91.9% vs 90.1%) compared to SPT-LoRA, and reduces memory usage by 31.1%-39.9% across models from 86M to 632M parameters.

Conclusion: SNELLA overcomes limitations of existing sparse tuning methods by providing a one-stage approach that achieves superior performance with significantly reduced memory consumption.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) aims to adapt pre-trained vision
models to downstream tasks. Among PEFT paradigms, sparse tuning achieves
remarkable performance by adjusting only the weights most relevant to
downstream tasks, rather than densely tuning the entire weight matrix. Current
methods follow a two-stage paradigm. First, it locates task-relevant weights by
gradient information, which overlooks the parameter adjustments during
fine-tuning and limits the performance. Second, it updates only the located
weights by applying a sparse mask to the gradient of the weight matrix, which
results in high memory usage due to the storage of all weight matrices in the
optimizer. In this paper, we propose a one-stage method named SNELLA to
overcome the above limitations. For memory usage, SNELLA selectively updates
the weight matrix by adding it to another sparse matrix that is merged by two
low-rank learnable matrices. We extend the low-rank decomposition by
introducing nonlinear kernel functions, thereby increasing the rank of the
resulting merged matrix to prevent the interdependency among weight updates,
enabling better adaptation to downstream tasks. For locating task-relevant
weights, we propose an adaptive bi-level sparsity allocation mechanism that
encourages weights to compete across and inside layers based on their
importance scores in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments are conducted
on classification, segmentation, and generation tasks using different
pre-trained vision models. The results show that SNELLA achieves SOTA
performance with low memory usage. Notably, SNELLA obtains 1.8% (91.9% v.s.
90.1%) higher Top-1 accuracy on the FGVC benchmark compared to SPT-LoRA.
Compared to previous methods, SNELLA achieves a memory reduction of 31.1%-39.9%
across models with parameter scales from 86M to 632M. Our source codes are

### [22] [Enhancing CLIP Robustness via Cross-Modality Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24038)
*Xingyu Zhu,Beier Zhu,Shuo Wang,Kesen Zhao,Hanwang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COLA is a training-free framework that improves adversarial robustness in CLIP models by restoring cross-modality alignment through optimal transport-based feature projection and structural consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models like CLIP have strong zero-shot classification but are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Existing methods overlook the feature misalignment between text and image embeddings, which gets amplified under adversarial conditions.

Method: COLA uses optimal transport to align image and text features: (1) projects adversarial image embeddings onto class text feature subspace to filter distortions, (2) models images and texts as discrete distributions over augmented views and refines alignment via optimal transport with integrated subspace projection.

Result: Extensive evaluations on 14 benchmarks show COLA improves robustness significantly, with average 6.7% improvement on ImageNet variants under PGD attacks while maintaining clean sample accuracy.

Conclusion: COLA effectively addresses adversarial misalignment in CLIP models through cross-modality alignment without requiring training, demonstrating strong performance across various benchmarks.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP demonstrate strong generalization
in zero-shot classification but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial
perturbations. Existing methods primarily focus on adversarial fine-tuning or
prompt optimization; they often overlook the gaps in CLIP's encoded features,
which is shown as the text and image features lie far apart from each other.
This misalignment is significantly amplified under adversarial perturbations,
leading to severe degradation in classification performance. To address this
problem, we propose Cross-modality Alignment, dubbed COLA, an optimal
transport-based framework that explicitly addresses adversarial misalignment by
restoring both global image-text alignment and local structural consistency in
the feature space. (1) COLA first projects adversarial image embeddings onto a
subspace spanned by class text features, effectively filtering out non-semantic
distortions while preserving discriminative information. (2) It then models
images and texts as discrete distributions over multiple augmented views and
refines their alignment via OT, with the subspace projection seamlessly
integrated into the cost computation. This design ensures stable cross-modal
alignment even under adversarial conditions. COLA is training-free and
compatible with existing fine-tuned models. Extensive evaluations across 14
zero-shot classification benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of COLA,
especially with an average improvement of 6.7% on ImageNet and its variants
under PGD adversarial attacks, while maintaining high accuracy on clean
samples.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BOB is a fine-tuning strategy for text-to-image models that extracts class-agnostic attributes (background, pose) and conditions on them during fine-tuning while marginalizing them out during generation, improving synthetic data quality for fine-grained classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning T2I models with few real examples can improve synthetic data quality but risks overfitting and reduced diversity, especially for fine-grained classification tasks.

Method: Extract class-agnostic attributes (background, object pose) from real examples, condition T2I model fine-tuning on these attributes, and marginalize them out during synthetic data generation to preserve diversity and reduce overfitting.

Result: BOB achieves SOTA performance in low-shot fine-grained classification, outperforming DataDream by 7.4% on Aircraft dataset and beating prior art in 18 of 24 experimental settings, with 2+% accuracy improvements in 14 settings.

Conclusion: BOB effectively mitigates overfitting while preserving generative diversity, enabling better synthetic data generation for fine-grained classification with limited real examples.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are increasingly used for synthetic dataset
generation, but generating effective synthetic training data for classification
remains challenging. Fine-tuning a T2I model with a few real examples can help
improve the quality of synthetic training data; however, it may also cause
overfitting and reduce diversity in the generated samples. We propose a
fine-tuning strategy BOB (BeyondOBjects) to mitigate these concerns for
fine-grained classification. Given a small set of real examples, we first
extract class-agnostic attributes such as scene background and object pose. We
then explicitly condition on these attributes during fine-tuning of the T2I
model and marginalize them out during generation. This design mitigates
overfitting, preserves the T2I model's generative prior, reduces estimation
errors, and further minimizes unintended inter-class associations. Extensive
experiments across multiple T2I models, backbones, and datasets show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-shot fine-grained
classification when augmented with synthetic data. Concretely, BOB outperforms
DataDream by 7.4% on the Aircraft dataset (from 50.0% to 57.4% when fine-tuning
a CLIP classifier with five real images augmented with 100 synthetic images).
In three of the four benchmarks, fine-tuning downstream models with 5 real
images augmented with BOB achieves better performance than fine-tuning with 10
real images. Collectively, BOB outperforms prior art in 18 of 24 experimental
settings, with 2+% accuracy improvements in 14 of these settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniText is a training-free generalist framework for Text Image Manipulation (TIM) that addresses limitations in existing text inpainting methods by enabling text removal, style control, and preventing duplicated letters through cross- and self-attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based text inpainting methods have three key limitations: inability to remove text, lack of style control over rendered text, and tendency to generate duplicated letters, which hinders their applicability to broader TIM tasks.

Method: Proposes OmniText using self-attention inversion for text removal and cross-attention redistribution to reduce text hallucinations. Introduces cross-attention content loss and self-attention style loss in a latent optimization framework for controllable inpainting. Also presents OmniText-Bench benchmark dataset.

Result: OmniText achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple TIM tasks and metrics, comparable to specialist methods. It successfully performs text removal, rescaling, repositioning, and insertion/editing with various styles.

Conclusion: OmniText is the first generalist method capable of performing diverse TIM tasks, addressing key limitations of existing text inpainting approaches through novel attention mechanisms and loss functions.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion-based text synthesis have demonstrated
significant performance in inserting and editing text within images via
inpainting. However, despite the potential of text inpainting methods, three
key limitations hinder their applicability to broader Text Image Manipulation
(TIM) tasks: (i) the inability to remove text, (ii) the lack of control over
the style of rendered text, and (iii) a tendency to generate duplicated
letters. To address these challenges, we propose OmniText, a training-free
generalist capable of performing a wide range of TIM tasks. Specifically, we
investigate two key properties of cross- and self-attention mechanisms to
enable text removal and to provide control over both text styles and content.
Our findings reveal that text removal can be achieved by applying
self-attention inversion, which mitigates the model's tendency to focus on
surrounding text, thus reducing text hallucinations. Additionally, we
redistribute cross-attention, as increasing the probability of certain text
tokens reduces text hallucination. For controllable inpainting, we introduce
novel loss functions in a latent optimization framework: a cross-attention
content loss to improve text rendering accuracy and a self-attention style loss
to facilitate style customization. Furthermore, we present OmniText-Bench, a
benchmark dataset for evaluating diverse TIM tasks. It includes input images,
target text with masks, and style references, covering diverse applications
such as text removal, rescaling, repositioning, and insertion and editing with
various styles. Our OmniText framework is the first generalist method capable
of performing diverse TIM tasks. It achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple tasks and metrics compared to other text inpainting methods and
is comparable with specialist methods.

*Shufan Shen,Zhaobo Qi,Junshu Sun,Qingming Huang,Qi Tian,Shuhui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Inherent Interpretability Score (IIS) to quantify representation interpretability in pre-trained vision models, discovering a positive correlation between interpretability and classifiability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether pre-trained visual representations can simultaneously achieve high interpretability and classifiability, as current models prioritize classifiability but lack interpretability for widespread applications.

Method: Quantify representation interpretability using IIS, which measures the ratio of interpretable semantics by evaluating information loss when capturing interpretations from pre-trained representations.

Result: Found a positive correlation between interpretability and classifiability - representations with higher classifiability provide more interpretable semantics. This enables interpretability-maximization fine-tuning to improve classifiability and obtain predictions with less accuracy degradation.

Conclusion: Practitioners can unify improvements in both interpretability and classifiability for pre-trained vision models, as the two properties are positively correlated rather than conflicting.

Abstract: The visual representation of a pre-trained model prioritizes the
classifiability on downstream tasks, while the widespread applications for
pre-trained visual models have posed new requirements for representation
interpretability. However, it remains unclear whether the pre-trained
representations can achieve high interpretability and classifiability
simultaneously. To answer this question, we quantify the representation
interpretability by leveraging its correlation with the ratio of interpretable
semantics within the representations. Given the pre-trained representations,
only the interpretable semantics can be captured by interpretations, whereas
the uninterpretable part leads to information loss. Based on this fact, we
propose the Inherent Interpretability Score (IIS) that evaluates the
information loss, measures the ratio of interpretable semantics, and quantifies
the representation interpretability. In the evaluation of the representation
interpretability with different classifiability, we surprisingly discover that
the interpretability and classifiability are positively correlated, i.e.,
representations with higher classifiability provide more interpretable
semantics that can be captured in the interpretations. This observation further
supports two benefits to the pre-trained representations. First, the
classifiability of representations can be further improved by fine-tuning with
interpretability maximization. Second, with the classifiability improvement for
the representations, we obtain predictions based on their interpretations with
less accuracy degradation. The discovered positive correlation and
corresponding applications show that practitioners can unify the improvements
in interpretability and classifiability for pre-trained vision models. Codes
are available at https://github.com/ssfgunner/IIS.

### [26] [UHKD: A Unified Framework for Heterogeneous Knowledge Distillation via Frequency-Domain Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24116)
*Fengming Yu,Haiwei Pan,Kejia Zhang,Jian Guan,Haiying Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UHKD is a knowledge distillation framework that uses frequency-domain transformations to enable effective knowledge transfer between heterogeneous teacher-student models, overcoming architectural discrepancies that limit traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional knowledge distillation methods perform poorly with heterogeneous models due to semantic discrepancies in intermediate representations, and most existing approaches focus only on logits space, missing valuable semantic information in intermediate layers.

Method: Proposes UHKD framework using Fourier transform to capture global feature information in frequency domain. Includes Feature Transformation Module (FTM) for compact teacher representations and Feature Alignment Module (FAM) for student projection and multi-level alignment. Uses joint objective combining MSE on intermediate features and KL divergence on logits.

Result: Achieves gains of 5.59% on CIFAR-100 and 0.83% on ImageNet-1K over the latest method, demonstrating effective cross-architecture knowledge transfer.

Conclusion: UHKD effectively unifies heterogeneous representations and enables efficient utilization of visual knowledge through frequency-domain feature alignment, addressing limitations of traditional knowledge distillation in heterogeneous scenarios.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective model compression technique that
transfers knowledge from a high-performance teacher to a lightweight student,
reducing cost while maintaining accuracy. In visual applications, where
large-scale image models are widely used, KD enables efficient deployment.
However, architectural diversity introduces semantic discrepancies that hinder
the use of intermediate representations. Most existing KD methods are designed
for homogeneous models and degrade in heterogeneous scenarios, especially when
intermediate features are involved. Prior studies mainly focus on the logits
space, making limited use of the semantic information in intermediate layers.
To address this limitation, Unified Heterogeneous Knowledge Distillation (UHKD)
is proposed as a framework that leverages intermediate features in the
frequency domain for cross-architecture transfer. Fourier transform is applied
to capture global feature information, alleviating representational
discrepancies between heterogeneous teacher-student pairs. A Feature
Transformation Module (FTM) produces compact frequency-domain representations
of teacher features, while a learnable Feature Alignment Module (FAM) projects
student features and aligns them via multi-level matching. Training is guided
by a joint objective combining mean squared error on intermediate features with
Kullback-Leibler divergence on logits. Experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K
demonstrate gains of 5.59% and 0.83% over the latest method, highlighting UHKD
as an effective approach for unifying heterogeneous representations and
enabling efficient utilization of visual knowledge

as limited scale and diversity. Leveraging DogMo, we establish four motion
recovery benchmark settings that support systematic evaluation across monocular
and multi-view, RGB and RGB-D inputs. To facilitate accurate motion recovery,
we further introduce a three-stage, instance-specific optimization pipeline
that fits the SMAL model to the motion sequences. Our method progressively
refines body shape and pose through coarse alignment, dense correspondence
supervision, and temporal regularization. Our dataset and method provide a
principled foundation for advancing research in dog motion recovery and open up
new directions at the intersection of computer vision, computer graphics, and
animal behavior modeling.

### [28] [ETC: training-free diffusion models acceleration with Error-aware Trend Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24129)
*Jiajian Xie,Hubery Yin,Chen Li,Zhou Zhao,Shengyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ETC is a training-free diffusion acceleration framework that uses trend consistency and error tolerance search to enable multi-step reuse without trajectory deviations, achieving 2.65x speedup over FLUX with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current training-free acceleration methods for diffusion models ignore denoising trends and lack error control, causing trajectory deviations and result inconsistencies when reusing model outputs across multiple steps.

Method: ETC introduces (1) a consistent trend predictor that projects historical denoising patterns into stable future directions distributed across multiple steps, and (2) a model-specific error tolerance search mechanism that finds corrective thresholds by identifying transition points from semantic planning to quality refinement.

Result: ETC achieves 2.65x acceleration over FLUX with only -0.074 SSIM score degradation in consistency, demonstrating effective speedup with minimal quality loss.

Conclusion: The proposed ETC framework successfully addresses trajectory deviation issues in diffusion model acceleration through trend consistency and adaptive error control, enabling efficient multi-step reuse while maintaining generation quality.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable generative quality but remain
bottlenecked by costly iterative sampling. Recent training-free methods
accelerate diffusion process by reusing model outputs. However, these methods
ignore denoising trends and lack error control for model-specific tolerance,
leading to trajectory deviations under multi-step reuse and exacerbating
inconsistencies in the generated results. To address these issues, we introduce
Error-aware Trend Consistency (ETC), a framework that (1) introduces a
consistent trend predictor that leverages the smooth continuity of diffusion
trajectories, projecting historical denoising patterns into stable future
directions and progressively distributing them across multiple approximation
steps to achieve acceleration without deviating; (2) proposes a model-specific
error tolerance search mechanism that derives corrective thresholds by
identifying transition points from volatile semantic planning to stable quality
refinement. Experiments show that ETC achieves a 2.65x acceleration over FLUX
with negligible (-0.074 SSIM score) degradation of consistency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free framework that improves text-to-image generation by using LLMs to create explicit layouts and VLM-based reranking to select the most prompt-aligned images iteratively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern text-to-image models struggle with compositionality, often failing to render accurate object counts, attributes, and spatial relations.

Method: Combines object-centric approach with self-refinement: uses LLMs to synthesize explicit layouts from prompts, injects layouts into generation process, and employs object-centric VLM to rerank candidates iteratively.

Result: Achieves stronger scene alignment with prompts compared to recent text-to-image models while preserving aesthetic quality.

Conclusion: The framework successfully improves layout faithfulness in text-to-image generation through explicit layout-grounding and self-refinement techniques.

Abstract: Despite their impressive realism, modern text-to-image models still struggle
with compositionality, often failing to render accurate object counts,
attributes, and spatial relations. To address this challenge, we present a
training-free framework that combines an object-centric approach with
self-refinement to improve layout faithfulness while preserving aesthetic
quality. Specifically, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to synthesize
explicit layouts from input prompts, and we inject these layouts into the image
generation process, where a object-centric vision-language model (VLM) judge
reranks multiple candidates to select the most prompt-aligned outcome
iteratively. By unifying explicit layout-grounding with self-refine-based
inference-time scaling, our framework achieves stronger scene alignment with
prompts compared to recent text-to-image models. The code are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSRANetV2, a CNN architecture with ResNet50V2 backbone enhanced with residual attention and SE blocks, achieves state-of-the-art performance in colorectal cancer tissue classification on two public datasets with excellent precision, recall, F1-score, AUC, and accuracy metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality, and conventional diagnostic methods like colonoscopy and histology are subjective, time-consuming, and variable. Deep learning can enhance diagnostic precision and efficiency in digital pathology.

Method: Proposed MSRANetV2 architecture using ResNet50V2 backbone with residual attention mechanisms and squeeze-and-excitation blocks for multi-scale feature fusion. Evaluated using five-fold stratified cross-validation on CRC-VAL-HE-7K and NCT-CRC-HE-100K datasets with Grad-CAM visualizations for interpretability.

Result: Achieved remarkable performance: on 7K dataset - precision 0.9884±0.0151, recall 0.9900±0.0151, F1-score 0.9900±0.0145, AUC 0.9999±0.00006, accuracy 0.9905±0.0025; on 100K dataset - precision 0.9904±0.0091, recall 0.9900±0.0071, F1-score 0.9900±0.0071, AUC 0.9997±0.00016, accuracy 0.9902±0.0006.

Conclusion: MSRANetV2 is a reliable, interpretable, and high-performing model for colorectal cancer tissue classification, validated through comprehensive evaluation and visualization techniques.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading worldwide cause of cancer-related
mortality, and the role of prompt precise detection is of paramount interest in
improving patient outcomes. Conventional diagnostic methods such as colonoscopy
and histological examination routinely exhibit subjectivity, are extremely
time-consuming, and are susceptible to variation. Through the development of
digital pathology, deep learning algorithms have become a powerful approach in
enhancing diagnostic precision and efficiency. In our work, we proposed a
convolutional neural network architecture named MSRANetV2, specially optimized
for the classification of colorectal tissue images. The model employs a
ResNet50V2 backbone, extended with residual attention mechanisms and
squeeze-and-excitation (SE) blocks, to extract deep semantic and fine-grained
spatial features. With channel alignment and upsampling operations, MSRANetV2
effectively fuses multi-scale representations, thereby enhancing the robustness
of the classification. We evaluated our model on a five-fold stratified
cross-validation strategy on two publicly available datasets: CRC-VAL-HE-7K and
NCT-CRC-HE-100K. The proposed model achieved remarkable average Precision,
recall, F1-score, AUC, and test accuracy were 0.9884 plus-minus 0.0151, 0.9900
plus-minus 0.0151, 0.9900 plus-minus 0.0145, 0.9999 plus-minus 0.00006, and
0.9905 plus-minus 0.0025 on the 7K dataset. On the 100K dataset, they were
0.9904 plus-minus 0.0091, 0.9900 plus-minus 0.0071, 0.9900 plus-minus 0.0071,
0.9997 plus-minus 0.00016, and 0.9902 plus-minus 0.0006. Additionally, Grad-CAM
visualizations were incorporated to enhance model interpretability by
highlighting tissue areas that are medically relevant. These findings validate
that MSRANetV2 is a reliable, interpretable, and high-performing architectural
model for classifying CRC tissues.

TL;DR: A systematic framework for autonomous driving scene understanding using Vision-Language Models, featuring Mixture-of-Prompts routing, task-specific prompts with spatial reasoning, visual assembly, and optimized inference parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance Vision-Language Models' performance on safety-critical autonomous driving tasks across perception, prediction, planning, and corruption detection by addressing interference across diverse question types and improving spatial reasoning capabilities.

Method: Four-component framework: 1) Mixture-of-Prompts router for question classification and expert prompt dispatch, 2) Task-specific prompts with coordinate systems, spatial reasoning, role-playing, and reasoning chains, 3) Visual assembly module for multi-view image composition with object crops and historical frames, 4) Task-specific inference parameter optimization.

Conclusion: Structured prompting and spatial grounding substantially enhance VLM performance on autonomous driving tasks, showing the effectiveness of systematic prompt engineering and task-specific optimization for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: This technical report presents our solution for the RoboSense Challenge at
IROS 2025, which evaluates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on autonomous driving
scene understanding across perception, prediction, planning, and corruption
detection tasks. We propose a systematic framework built on four core
components. First, a Mixture-of-Prompts router classifies questions and
dispatches them to task-specific expert prompts, eliminating interference
across diverse question types. Second, task-specific prompts embed explicit
coordinate systems, spatial reasoning rules, role-playing,
Chain-of-Thought/Tree-of-Thought reasoning, and few-shot examples tailored to
each task. Third, a visual assembly module composes multi-view images with
object crops, magenta markers, and adaptive historical frames based on question
requirements. Fourth, we configure model inference parameters (temperature,
top-p, message roles) per task to optimize output quality. Implemented on
Qwen2.5-VL-72B, our approach achieves 70.87% average accuracy on Phase-1 (clean
data) and 72.85% on Phase-2 (corrupted data), demonstrating that structured

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UAP-SAM2 is a universal adversarial attack method targeting SAM2, addressing challenges from architectural differences with SAM through cross-prompt transferability and dual semantic deviation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM2's robustness remains unexplored despite its strong video segmentation capabilities, and existing SAM attacks may not transfer effectively due to architectural differences in prompt guidance and frame semantics.

Method: Proposes UAP-SAM2 with target-scanning strategy to reduce prompt dependency and dual semantic deviation framework that distorts intra-frame semantics and disrupts inter-frame semantic consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments on six datasets across two segmentation tasks show UAP-SAM2 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art attacks by a large margin.

Conclusion: The proposed UAP-SAM2 effectively addresses the unique challenges in attacking SAM2 and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Recent studies reveal the vulnerability of the image segmentation foundation
model SAM to adversarial examples. Its successor, SAM2, has attracted
significant attention due to its strong generalization capability in video
segmentation. However, its robustness remains unexplored, and it is unclear
whether existing attacks on SAM can be directly transferred to SAM2. In this
paper, we first analyze the performance gap of existing attacks between SAM and
SAM2 and highlight two key challenges arising from their architectural
differences: directional guidance from the prompt and semantic entanglement
across consecutive frames. To address these issues, we propose UAP-SAM2, the
first cross-prompt universal adversarial attack against SAM2 driven by dual
semantic deviation. For cross-prompt transferability, we begin by designing a
target-scanning strategy that divides each frame into k regions, each randomly
assigned a prompt, to reduce prompt dependency during optimization. For
effectiveness, we design a dual semantic deviation framework that optimizes a
UAP by distorting the semantics within the current frame and disrupting the
semantic consistency across consecutive frames. Extensive experiments on six
datasets across two segmentation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method for SAM2. The comparative results show that UAP-SAM2
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) attacks by a large margin.

*Junhyuk So,Hyunho Kook,Chaeyeon Jang,Eunhyeok Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MC-SJD is a training-free, lossless parallel decoding framework that accelerates autoregressive visual generation by improving token stability across iterations through coupling-based sampling, achieving up to 4.2x image generation and 13.3x video generation speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive modeling for visual generation suffers from slow inference speed due to per-token generation requiring thousands of steps, limiting practical adoption despite its potential.

Method: Extends Speculative Jacobi Decoding (SJD) with MC-SJD, an information-theoretic approach using coupling to maximize probability of sampling identical draft tokens across iterations while preserving lossless property, requiring only single-line modification to existing algorithm.

Result: Achieves substantial performance gains with up to ~4.2x acceleration in image generation and ~13.3x acceleration in video generation compared to standard AR decoding, without any degradation in output quality.

Conclusion: MC-SJD provides an efficient solution to accelerate autoregressive visual generation while maintaining lossless decoding, enabling practical deployment of AR models through simple algorithmic modification.

Abstract: While autoregressive (AR) modeling has recently emerged as a new paradigm in
visual generation, its practical adoption is severely constrained by the slow
inference speed of per-token generation, which often requires thousands of
steps to produce a single sample. To address this challenge, we propose MC-SJD,
a training-free, lossless parallel decoding framework designed to accelerate AR
visual generation by extending the recently introduced Speculative Jacobi
Decoding (SJD). Although SJD shows strong potential for accelerating AR
generation, we demonstrate that token instability across iterations
significantly reduces the acceptance rate, a limitation that primarily arises
from the independent sampling process used during draft token generation. To
overcome this, we introduce MC-SJD, an information-theoretic approach based on
coupling, which substantially accelerates standard SJD by maximizing the
probability of sampling identical draft tokens across consecutive iterations,
all while preserving its lossless property. Remarkably, this method requires
only a single-line modification to the existing algorithm, yet achieves
substantial performance gains, delivering up to a ~4.2x acceleration in image
generation and ~13.3x acceleration in video generation compared to standard AR
decoding, without any degradation in output quality.

*Haoxin Yang,Yihong Lin,Jingdan Kang,Xuemiao Xu,Yue Li,Cheng Xu,Shengfeng He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ID²Face is a training-centric face anonymization framework that learns a disentangled latent space to separate identity and non-identity features, enabling direct anonymization without inference-time optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based anonymization methods rely on inference-time interventions that cause distribution shifts and entangle identity with non-identity attributes, degrading visual quality and data utility.

Method: Uses a conditional diffusion model with identity-masked learning, Identity-Decoupled Latent Recomposer with Identity VAE, bidirectional latent alignment, and Identity-Guided Latent Harmonizer with soft-gating. Includes Orthogonal Identity Mapping to suppress identity leakage.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in visual quality, identity suppression, and utility preservation.

Conclusion: ID²Face provides effective face anonymization through explicit disentanglement of identity and non-identity features in a structured latent space, eliminating the need for inference-time optimization.

Abstract: Face anonymization aims to conceal identity information while preserving
non-identity attributes. Mainstream diffusion models rely on inference-time
interventions such as negative guidance or energy-based optimization, which are
applied post-training to suppress identity features. These interventions often
introduce distribution shifts and entangle identity with non-identity
attributes, degrading visual fidelity and data utility. To address this, we
propose \textbf{ID\textsuperscript{2}Face}, a training-centric anonymization
framework that removes the need for inference-time optimization. The rationale
of our method is to learn a structured latent space where identity and
non-identity information are explicitly disentangled, enabling direct and
controllable anonymization at inference. To this end, we design a conditional
diffusion model with an identity-masked learning scheme. An Identity-Decoupled
Latent Recomposer uses an Identity Variational Autoencoder to model identity
features, while non-identity attributes are extracted from same-identity pairs
and aligned through bidirectional latent alignment. An Identity-Guided Latent
Harmonizer then fuses these representations via soft-gating conditioned on
noisy feature prediction. The model is trained with a recomposition-based
reconstruction loss to enforce disentanglement. At inference, anonymization is
achieved by sampling a random identity vector from the learned identity space.
To further suppress identity leakage, we introduce an Orthogonal Identity
Mapping strategy that enforces orthogonality between sampled and source
identity vectors. Experiments demonstrate that ID\textsuperscript{2}Face
outperforms existing methods in visual quality, identity suppression, and
utility preservation.

*Jinhong Deng,Wen Li,Joey Tianyi Zhou,Yang He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCOPE is a visual token pruning method for MLLMs that jointly considers saliency and coverage to preserve semantic completeness while reducing computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual token pruning methods focus only on saliency, leading to semantic incompleteness in selected tokens despite computational savings.

Method: Proposes SCOPE score that combines saliency and token-coverage gain, iteratively selecting tokens with highest SCOPE score based on set-coverage relationships.

Result: Outperforms prior approaches on multiple vision-language benchmarks using LLaVA-1.5 and LLaVA-Next models.

Conclusion: SCOPE effectively reduces computational overhead while maintaining semantic completeness through joint modeling of saliency and coverage.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) typically process a large number of
visual tokens, leading to considerable computational overhead, even though many
of these tokens are redundant. Existing visual token pruning methods primarily
focus on selecting the most salient tokens based on attention scores, resulting
in the semantic incompleteness of the selected tokens. In this paper, we
propose a novel visual token pruning strategy, called
\textbf{S}aliency-\textbf{C}overage \textbf{O}riented token \textbf{P}runing
for \textbf{E}fficient MLLMs (SCOPE), to jointly model both the saliency and
coverage of the selected visual tokens to better preserve semantic
completeness. Specifically, we introduce a set-coverage for a given set of
selected tokens, computed based on the token relationships. We then define a
token-coverage gain for each unselected token, quantifying how much additional
coverage would be obtained by including it. By integrating the saliency score
into the token-coverage gain, we propose our SCOPE score and iteratively select
the token with the highest SCOPE score. We conduct extensive experiments on
multiple vision-language understanding benchmarks using the LLaVA-1.5 and
LLaVA-Next models. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms prior approaches. Our code is available at

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first event-based microsaccade dataset using simulated eye movements and evaluates spiking neural networks for microsaccade classification, achieving around 90% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional microsaccade studies use expensive eye trackers with limited scalability and temporal resolution. Event-based sensing offers high-speed, low-latency alternatives for capturing fine-grained eye movements.

Method: Used Blender to render high-fidelity eye movement scenarios with microsaccades (0.5-2.0 degrees angular displacement, 7 classes), converted to event streams using v2e. Evaluated with Spiking-VGG models and proposed Spiking-VGG16Flow with optical flow enhancement.

Result: Models achieved around 90% average accuracy in classifying microsaccades by angular displacement, independent of event count or duration.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of spiking neural networks for fine motion recognition and establishes a benchmark for event-based vision research.

Abstract: Microsaccades are small, involuntary eye movements vital for visual
perception and neural processing. Traditional microsaccade studies typically
use eye trackers or frame-based analysis, which, while precise, are costly and
limited in scalability and temporal resolution. Event-based sensing offers a
high-speed, low-latency alternative by capturing fine-grained spatiotemporal
changes efficiently. This work introduces a pioneering event-based microsaccade
dataset to support research on small eye movement dynamics in cognitive
computing. Using Blender, we render high-fidelity eye movement scenarios and
simulate microsaccades with angular displacements from 0.5 to 2.0 degrees,
divided into seven distinct classes. These are converted to event streams using
v2e, preserving the natural temporal dynamics of microsaccades, with durations
ranging from 0.25 ms to 2.25 ms. We evaluate the dataset using Spiking-VGG11,
Spiking-VGG13, and Spiking-VGG16, and propose Spiking-VGG16Flow, an
optical-flow-enhanced variant implemented in SpikingJelly. The models achieve
around 90 percent average accuracy, successfully classifying microsaccades by
angular displacement, independent of event count or duration. These results
demonstrate the potential of spiking neural networks for fine motion
recognition and establish a benchmark for event-based vision research. The

*Qing Zhao,Weijian Deng,Pengxu Wei,ZiYi Dong,Hannan Lu,Xiangyang Ji,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Lipschitz-regularized object detection (LROD) to address the functional mismatch between image restoration and object detection networks, improving detection robustness in adverse conditions like haze and low light.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cascade frameworks that use image restoration as pre-processing for object detection suffer from functional mismatch, where restoration networks perform smooth transformations while detectors have discontinuous decision boundaries, causing instability and sensitivity to minor perturbations.

Method: The authors propose LROD framework that integrates image restoration directly into detector's feature learning with Lipschitz regularization. They implement this as LR-YOLO, which harmonizes Lipschitz continuity of both restoration and detection tasks during training.

Result: Extensive experiments on haze and low-light benchmarks show that LR-YOLO consistently improves detection stability, optimization smoothness, and overall accuracy compared to traditional cascade approaches.

Conclusion: Lipschitz regularization effectively addresses the functional mismatch between restoration and detection networks, enabling more stable and robust object detection in adverse conditions through direct integration rather than cascade pre-processing.

Abstract: To improve detection robustness in adverse conditions (e.g., haze and low
light), image restoration is commonly applied as a pre-processing step to
enhance image quality for the detector. However, the functional mismatch
between restoration and detection networks can introduce instability and hinder
effective integration -- an issue that remains underexplored. We revisit this
limitation through the lens of Lipschitz continuity, analyzing the functional
differences between restoration and detection networks in both the input space
and the parameter space. Our analysis shows that restoration networks perform
smooth, continuous transformations, while object detectors operate with
discontinuous decision boundaries, making them highly sensitive to minor
perturbations. This mismatch introduces instability in traditional cascade
frameworks, where even imperceptible noise from restoration is amplified during
detection, disrupting gradient flow and hindering optimization. To address
this, we propose Lipschitz-regularized object detection (LROD), a simple yet
effective framework that integrates image restoration directly into the
detector's feature learning, harmonizing the Lipschitz continuity of both tasks
during training. We implement this framework as Lipschitz-regularized YOLO
(LR-YOLO), extending seamlessly to existing YOLO detectors. Extensive
experiments on haze and low-light benchmarks demonstrate that LR-YOLO
consistently improves detection stability, optimization smoothness, and overall
accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeshadowMamba uses Mamba's selective state space model for shadow removal, enhanced with CrossGate for shadow-aware context integration and ColorShift regularization for color fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attention-based shadow removal models mix irrelevant illumination cues, causing distorted structures and inconsistent colors. Mamba's directional state transitions offer better global context while preserving positional continuity.

Method: Proposes CrossGate for directional modulation with shadow-aware similarity, and ColorShift regularization using contrastive learning with global color statistics to suppress color contamination.

Result: DeshadowMamba achieves state-of-the-art visual quality and strong quantitative performance on public benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach successfully adapts sequence modeling to shadow removal requirements, maintaining structural integrity and chromatic consistency through directional context integration and color regularization.

Abstract: Recent deep models for image shadow removal often rely on attention-based
architectures to capture long-range dependencies. However, their fixed
attention patterns tend to mix illumination cues from irrelevant regions,
leading to distorted structures and inconsistent colors. In this work, we
revisit shadow removal from a sequence modeling perspective and explore the use
of Mamba, a selective state space model that propagates global context through
directional state transitions. These transitions yield an efficient global
receptive field while preserving positional continuity. Despite its potential,
directly applying Mamba to image data is suboptimal, since it lacks awareness
of shadow-non-shadow semantics and remains susceptible to color interference
from nearby regions. To address these limitations, we propose CrossGate, a
directional modulation mechanism that injects shadow-aware similarity into
Mamba's input gate, allowing selective integration of relevant context along
transition axes. To further ensure appearance fidelity, we introduce ColorShift
regularization, a contrastive learning objective driven by global color
statistics. By synthesizing structured informative negatives, it guides the
model to suppress color contamination and achieve robust color restoration.
Together, these components adapt sequence modeling to the structural integrity
and chromatic consistency required for shadow removal. Extensive experiments on
public benchmarks demonstrate that DeshadowMamba achieves state-of-the-art
visual quality and strong quantitative performance.

*Jiyu Guo,Shuo Yang,Yiming Huang,Yancheng Long,Xiaobo Xia,Xiu Su,Bo Zhao,Zeke Xie,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UtilGen is a utility-centric data augmentation framework that optimizes synthetic data generation using downstream task feedback, achieving superior performance over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data augmentation methods focus on visual quality but neglect task-specific requirements, which vary across different tasks and architectures.

Method: Uses a weight allocation network to evaluate task-specific utility, with dual-level optimization: model-level (tailors generative model) and instance-level (adjusts generation policies like prompts and noise).

Result: Achieved average 3.87% accuracy improvement over SOTA on eight benchmark datasets, producing more impactful and task-relevant synthetic data.

Conclusion: UtilGen validates the effectiveness of shifting from visual characteristics-centric to task utility-centric data augmentation paradigm.

Abstract: Data augmentation using generative models has emerged as a powerful paradigm
for enhancing performance in computer vision tasks. However, most existing
augmentation approaches primarily focus on optimizing intrinsic data attributes
-- such as fidelity and diversity -- to generate visually high-quality
synthetic data, while often neglecting task-specific requirements. Yet, it is
essential for data generators to account for the needs of downstream tasks, as
training data requirements can vary significantly across different tasks and
network architectures. To address these limitations, we propose UtilGen, a
novel utility-centric data augmentation framework that adaptively optimizes the
data generation process to produce task-specific, high-utility training data
via downstream task feedback. Specifically, we first introduce a weight
allocation network to evaluate the task-specific utility of each synthetic
sample. Guided by these evaluations, UtilGen iteratively refines the data
generation process using a dual-level optimization strategy to maximize the
synthetic data utility: (1) model-level optimization tailors the generative
model to the downstream task, and (2) instance-level optimization adjusts
generation policies -- such as prompt embeddings and initial noise -- at each
generation round. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets of varying
complexity and granularity demonstrate that UtilGen consistently achieves
superior performance, with an average accuracy improvement of 3.87% over
previous SOTA. Further analysis of data influence and distribution reveals that
UtilGen produces more impactful and task-relevant synthetic data, validating
the effectiveness of the paradigm shift from visual characteristics-centric to
task utility-centric data augmentation.

*Pietro Bongini,Valentina Molinari,Andrea Costanzo,Benedetta Tondi,Mauro Barni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free one-shot attribution method using image resynthesis to identify the source of synthetic images, outperforming existing techniques in data-scarce conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic image source attribution is challenging in data scarcity conditions requiring few-shot or zero-shot classification capabilities.

Method: Generate a prompt describing the image, resynthesize it with all candidate sources, then attribute to the model producing the closest resynthesis in feature space.

Result: The proposed resynthesis method outperforms state-of-the-art few-shot approaches and other baselines when only a few training samples are available.

Conclusion: The method is effective for synthetic image attribution in data-scarce scenarios, and the new dataset provides a valuable benchmark for future few-shot and zero-shot methods.

Abstract: Synthetic image source attribution is a challenging task, especially in data
scarcity conditions requiring few-shot or zero-shot classification
capabilities. We present a new training-free one-shot attribution method based
on image resynthesis. A prompt describing the image under analysis is
generated, then it is used to resynthesize the image with all the candidate
sources. The image is attributed to the model which produced the resynthesis
closest to the original image in a proper feature space. We also introduce a
new dataset for synthetic image attribution consisting of face images from
commercial and open-source text-to-image generators. The dataset provides a
challenging attribution framework, useful for developing new attribution models
and testing their capabilities on different generative architectures. The
dataset structure allows to test approaches based on resynthesis and to compare
them to few-shot methods. Results from state-of-the-art few-shot approaches and
other baselines show that the proposed resynthesis method outperforms existing
techniques when only a few samples are available for training or fine-tuning.
The experiments also demonstrate that the new dataset is a challenging one and
represents a valuable benchmark for developing and evaluating future few-shot
and zero-shot methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViPER is a self-bootstrapping framework that enhances fine-grained visual perception in VLMs through a two-stage reinforcement learning approach with self-critiquing and self-prediction, achieving significant performance gains while maintaining general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the critical bottleneck of limited fine-grained visual perception in Vision-Language Models, which is challenging due to data scarcity and limitations of existing methods like SFT (compromises general capabilities) and RFT (prioritizes textual reasoning over visual perception).

Method: Proposes a two-stage task structuring visual perception as coarse-to-fine progressive process. Develops ViPER framework with self-bootstrapping, integrating image-level and instance-level reconstruction with two-stage reinforcement learning strategy to create closed-loop training using internally synthesized data.

Result: Applied to Qwen2.5-VL family, produces Qwen-Viper series with average gain of 1.7% on seven comprehensive benchmarks and up to 6.0% on fine-grained perception. Consistently demonstrates superior performance across vision-language scenarios while maintaining generalizability.

Conclusion: ViPER enables self-improvement in perceptual capabilities and provides evidence for the reciprocal relationship between generation and understanding, representing a breakthrough for developing more autonomous and capable VLMs.

Abstract: The limited capacity for fine-grained visual perception presents a critical
bottleneck for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in real-world applications.
Addressing this is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality data and the
limitations of existing methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often compromises
general capabilities, while reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) prioritizes textual
reasoning over visual perception. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel
two-stage task that structures visual perception learning as a coarse-to-fine
progressive process. Based on this task formulation, we develop ViPER, a
self-bootstrapping framework specifically designed to enable iterative
evolution through self-critiquing and self-prediction. By synergistically
integrating image-level and instance-level reconstruction with a two-stage
reinforcement learning strategy, ViPER establishes a closed-loop training
paradigm, where internally synthesized data directly fuel the enhancement of
perceptual ability. Applied to the Qwen2.5-VL family, ViPER produces the
Qwen-Viper series. With an average gain of 1.7% on seven comprehensive
benchmarks spanning various tasks and up to 6.0% on fine-grained perception,
Qwen-Viper consistently demonstrates superior performance across different
vision-language scenarios while maintaining generalizability. Beyond enabling
self-improvement in perceptual capabilities, ViPER provides concrete evidence
for the reciprocal relationship between generation and understanding, a
breakthrough to developing more autonomous and capable VLMs.

*Ivica Dimitrovski,Vlatko Spasev,Ivan Kitanovski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Prompt learning methods outperform zero-shot CLIP and linear probes for few-shot remote sensing scene classification, with Prompting with Self-Regulating Constraints showing the best cross-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the performance limitations of deep learning in remote sensing due to scarce labeled data and high annotation costs across diverse domains, and bridge the domain gap when applying vision-language models like CLIP to remote sensing.

Method: Systematically evaluated several prompt learning methods: Context Optimization, Conditional Context Optimization, Multi-modal Prompt Learning, and Prompting with Self-Regulating Constraints. Compared against zero-shot CLIP with hand-crafted prompts and linear probe on frozen CLIP features.

Result: Prompt learning consistently outperforms both baselines in few-shot scenarios across multiple remote sensing datasets. Prompting with Self-Regulating Constraints achieves the most robust cross-domain performance in generalization tests.

Conclusion: Prompt learning provides a scalable and efficient solution for bridging domain gaps in satellite and aerial imagery, offering a strong foundation for future remote sensing research.

Abstract: Remote sensing applications increasingly rely on deep learning for scene
classification. However, their performance is often constrained by the scarcity
of labeled data and the high cost of annotation across diverse geographic and
sensor domains. While recent vision-language models like CLIP have shown
promise by learning transferable representations at scale by aligning visual
and textual modalities, their direct application to remote sensing remains
suboptimal due to significant domain gaps and the need for task-specific
semantic adaptation. To address this critical challenge, we systematically
explore prompt learning as a lightweight and efficient adaptation strategy for
few-shot remote sensing image scene classification. We evaluate several
representative methods, including Context Optimization, Conditional Context
Optimization, Multi-modal Prompt Learning, and Prompting with Self-Regulating
Constraints. These approaches reflect complementary design philosophies: from
static context optimization to conditional prompts for enhanced generalization,
multi-modal prompts for joint vision-language adaptation, and semantically
regularized prompts for stable learning without forgetting. We benchmark these
prompt-learning methods against two standard baselines: zero-shot CLIP with
hand-crafted prompts and a linear probe trained on frozen CLIP features.
Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark remote sensing datasets,
including cross-dataset generalization tests, we demonstrate that prompt
learning consistently outperforms both baselines in few-shot scenarios.
Notably, Prompting with Self-Regulating Constraints achieves the most robust
cross-domain performance. Our findings underscore prompt learning as a scalable
and efficient solution for bridging the domain gap in satellite and aerial
imagery, providing a strong foundation for future research in this field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Teacher-student frameworks in semi-supervised medical image segmentation are limited by strong correlation and unreliable knowledge transfer between teacher and student networks.

Method: Switching Dual-Student architecture that selects the most reliable student at each iteration, combined with Loss-Aware Exponential Moving Average to dynamically ensure teacher absorbs meaningful information from students.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods on 3D medical image segmentation datasets, improving segmentation accuracy under limited supervision.

Conclusion: The plug-and-play framework effectively enhances segmentation performance in semi-supervised medical image analysis by improving collaboration and knowledge transfer quality.

Abstract: Teacher-student frameworks have emerged as a leading approach in
semi-supervised medical image segmentation, demonstrating strong performance
across various tasks. However, the learning effects are still limited by the
strong correlation and unreliable knowledge transfer process between teacher
and student networks. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel
switching Dual-Student architecture that strategically selects the most
reliable student at each iteration to enhance dual-student collaboration and
prevent error reinforcement. We also introduce a strategy of Loss-Aware
Exponential Moving Average to dynamically ensure that the teacher absorbs
meaningful information from students, improving the quality of pseudo-labels.
Our plug-and-play framework is extensively evaluated on 3D medical image
segmentation datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised
methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving segmentation accuracy

### [46] [Decoupling What to Count and Where to See for Referring Expression Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24374)
*Yuda Zou,Zijian Zhang,Yongchao Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: W2-Net addresses the overlooked challenge in Referring Expression Counting (REC) where annotation points focus on class-representative locations, causing models to neglect attribute information. It introduces dual-query mechanism and Subclass Separable Matching to improve subclass discrimination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current REC methods suffer from annotation bias where points are placed on class-representative locations (e.g., heads), forcing models to focus on class-level features while ignoring attribute information from other visual regions (e.g., legs for 'walking').

Method: W2-Net uses a dual-query mechanism with 'what-to-count' (w2c) queries for object localization and dedicated 'where-to-see' (w2s) queries to extract features from attribute-specific visual regions. It also introduces Subclass Separable Matching (SSM) with repulsive force for better inter-subclass separability.

Result: W2-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art on REC-8K dataset, reducing counting error by 22.5% (validation) and 18.0% (test), and improving localization F1 by 7% and 8% respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-query mechanism and SSM strategy effectively address the annotation bias problem in REC, enabling better subclass discrimination and significantly improving counting and localization performance.

Abstract: Referring Expression Counting (REC) extends class-level object counting to
the fine-grained subclass-level, aiming to enumerate objects matching a textual
expression that specifies both the class and distinguishing attribute. A
fundamental challenge, however, has been overlooked: annotation points are
typically placed on class-representative locations (e.g., heads), forcing
models to focus on class-level features while neglecting attribute information
from other visual regions (e.g., legs for "walking"). To address this, we
propose W2-Net, a novel framework that explicitly decouples the problem into
"what to count" and "where to see" via a dual-query mechanism. Specifically,
alongside the standard what-to-count (w2c) queries that localize the object, we
introduce dedicated where-to-see (w2s) queries. The w2s queries are guided to
seek and extract features from attribute-specific visual regions, enabling
precise subclass discrimination. Furthermore, we introduce Subclass Separable
Matching (SSM), a novel matching strategy that incorporates a repulsive force
to enhance inter-subclass separability during label assignment. W2-Net
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on the REC-8K dataset, reducing
counting error by 22.5% (validation) and 18.0% (test), and improving
localization F1 by 7% and 8%, respectively. Code will be available.

TL;DR: StrokeSeg is a lightweight, modular framework that converts research-grade stroke lesion segmentation models into deployable clinical applications with equivalent performance to original PyTorch pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning frameworks like nnU-Net achieve state-of-the-art performance but are difficult to deploy clinically due to heavy dependencies and monolithic design.

Method: Decouples preprocessing, inference, and postprocessing; uses Anima toolbox for BIDS-compliant preprocessing and ONNX Runtime with Float16 quantization for inference, reducing model size by 50%. Provides both GUI and CLI interfaces.

Result: On 300 sub-acute and chronic stroke subjects, segmentation performance was equivalent to original PyTorch pipeline (Dice difference <10^{-3}).

Conclusion: High-performing research pipelines can be successfully transformed into portable, clinically usable tools without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Deep learning frameworks such as nnU-Net achieve state-of-the-art performance
in brain lesion segmentation but remain difficult to deploy clinically due to
heavy dependencies and monolithic design. We introduce \textit{StrokeSeg}, a
modular and lightweight framework that translates research-grade stroke lesion
segmentation models into deployable applications. Preprocessing, inference, and
postprocessing are decoupled: preprocessing relies on the Anima toolbox with
BIDS-compliant outputs, and inference uses ONNX Runtime with \texttt{Float16}
quantisation, reducing model size by about 50\%. \textit{StrokeSeg} provides
both graphical and command-line interfaces and is distributed as Python scripts
and as a standalone Windows executable. On a held-out set of 300 sub-acute and
chronic stroke subjects, segmentation performance was equivalent to the
original PyTorch pipeline (Dice difference $<10^{-3}$), demonstrating that
high-performing research pipelines can be transformed into portable, clinically
usable tools.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A luminance-aware multi-scale network (MLSN) for polarization image fusion that addresses contrast differences in polarized images and complex lighting conditions through dynamic luminance injection, global-local feature fusion, and brightness enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Polarization image fusion combines S0 and DOLP images to reveal surface roughness and material properties, with applications in camouflage recognition, tissue pathology analysis, and surface defect detection. The challenge is integrating complementary information from different polarized images in complex luminance environments.

Method: Proposed MLSN with: 1) Multi-scale spatial weight matrix in encoder to dynamically inject luminance into feature maps; 2) Global-local feature fusion mechanism at bottleneck using windowed self-attention; 3) Brightness-Enhancement module in decoder for nonlinear luminance correction; 4) New MSP dataset with 1000 pairs of polarized images covering 17 complex lighting scenes.

Result: Extensive experiments on MSP, PIF and GAND datasets show MLSN outperforms state-of-the-art methods. MS-SSIM and SD metrics are higher than average of other methods by 8.57%, 60.64%, 10.26%, 63.53%, 22.21%, and 54.31% respectively.

Conclusion: MLSN effectively addresses contrast differences in polarized images and complex lighting conditions, achieving superior performance in polarization image fusion. The proposed MSP dataset solves the scarcity of high-quality datasets in this field.

Abstract: Polarization image fusion combines S0 and DOLP images to reveal surface
roughness and material properties through complementary texture features, which
has important applications in camouflage recognition, tissue pathology
analysis, surface defect detection and other fields. To intergrate
coL-Splementary information from different polarized images in complex
luminance environment, we propose a luminance-aware multi-scale network (MLSN).
In the encoder stage, we propose a multi-scale spatial weight matrix through a
brightness-branch , which dynamically weighted inject the luminance into the
feature maps, solving the problem of inherent contrast difference in polarized
images. The global-local feature fusion mechanism is designed at the bottleneck
layer to perform windowed self-attention computation, to balance the global
context and local details through residual linking in the feature dimension
restructuring stage. In the decoder stage, to further improve the adaptability
to complex lighting, we propose a Brightness-Enhancement module, establishing
the mapping relationship between luminance distribution and texture features,
realizing the nonlinear luminance correction of the fusion result. We also
present MSP, an 1000 pairs of polarized images that covers 17 types of indoor
and outdoor complex lighting scenes. MSP provides four-direction polarization
raw maps, solving the scarcity of high-quality datasets in polarization image
fusion. Extensive experiment on MSP, PIF and GAND datasets verify that the
proposed MLSN outperms the state-of-the-art methods in subjective and objective
evaluations, and the MS-SSIM and SD metircs are higher than the average values
of other methods by 8.57%, 60.64%, 10.26%, 63.53%, 22.21%, and 54.31%,

### [49] [When are radiology reports useful for training medical image classifiers?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24385)
*Herman Bergström,Zhongqi Yue,Fredrik D. Johansson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper systematically studies when and how radiology reports can improve medical image classification, finding that text-based pre-training helps when labels are well-represented in text, but can be detrimental otherwise, while fine-tuning with reports often provides significant benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical images come with rich radiology reports, but using them requires radiologist input. The paper aims to determine when these reports can improve image-only classification, addressing gaps in prior work that focused only on diagnostic labels strongly associated with text.

Method: Systematic study of using radiology reports during both pre-training and fine-tuning across diagnostic and prognostic tasks, evaluating under varying training set sizes and different label-text associations.

Result: Pre-training with reports helps when labels are well-represented in text but can be detrimental otherwise. Fine-tuning with reports provides significant improvements and can have larger impact than pre-training in some settings.

Conclusion: The study provides actionable insights for leveraging privileged text data in medical image classification, highlighting that report utility depends on label-text association and identifying gaps in current research approaches.

Abstract: Medical images used to train machine learning models are often accompanied by
radiology reports containing rich expert annotations. However, relying on these
reports as inputs for clinical prediction requires the timely manual work of a
trained radiologist. This raises a natural question: when can radiology reports
be leveraged during training to improve image-only classification? Prior works
are limited to evaluating pre-trained image representations by fine-tuning them
to predict diagnostic labels, often extracted from reports, ignoring tasks with
labels that are weakly associated with the text. To address this gap, we
conduct a systematic study of how radiology reports can be used during both
pre-training and fine-tuning, across diagnostic and prognostic tasks (e.g.,
12-month readmission), and under varying training set sizes. Our findings
reveal that: (1) Leveraging reports during pre-training is beneficial for
downstream classification tasks where the label is well-represented in the
text; however, pre-training through explicit image-text alignment can be
detrimental in settings where it's not; (2) Fine-tuning with reports can lead
to significant improvements and even have a larger impact than the pre-training
method in certain settings. These results provide actionable insights into when
and how to leverage privileged text data to train medical image classifiers
while highlighting gaps in current research.

TL;DR: REFLECT, a flow-based generative model, is evaluated for unsupervised detection of both focal and non-lesional abnormalities in post-stroke patients, showing improved performance when trained on healthy controls rather than lesion-free slices from stroke patients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-stroke MRI reveals secondary structural changes like atrophy and ventricular enlargement that are poorly captured by supervised segmentation methods but serve as important imaging biomarkers for recovery and outcome.

Method: Used REFLECT, a flow-based generative model, for unsupervised anomaly detection. Trained two models: one on lesion-free slices from stroke patients (ATLAS) and another on healthy controls (IXI). Evaluated performance using dual-expert annotations with Free-Response ROC analysis for anomaly maps.

Result: The IXI-trained model achieved higher lesion segmentation (Dice = 0.37 vs 0.27) and improved sensitivity to non-lesional abnormalities (FROC = 0.62 vs 0.43) compared to the ATLAS-trained model on test subjects.

Conclusion: Training on fully healthy anatomy improves the modeling of normal variability, enabling broader and more reliable detection of structural abnormalities in post-stroke patients.

Abstract: Post-stroke MRI not only delineates focal lesions but also reveals secondary
structural changes, such as atrophy and ventricular enlargement. These
abnormalities, increasingly recognised as imaging biomarkers of recovery and
outcome, remain poorly captured by supervised segmentation methods. We evaluate
REFLECT, a flow-based generative model, for unsupervised detection of both
focal and non-lesional abnormalities in post-stroke patients. Using dual-expert
central-slice annotations on ATLAS data, performance was assessed at the object
level with Free-Response ROC analysis for anomaly maps. Two models were trained
on lesion-free slices from stroke patients (ATLAS) and on healthy controls
(IXI) to test the effect of training data. On ATLAS test subjects, the
IXI-trained model achieved higher lesion segmentation (Dice = 0.37 vs 0.27) and
improved sensitivity to non-lesional abnormalities (FROC = 0.62 vs 0.43).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in multi-object tracking including unknown/varying target counts, maintaining target identity consistency, handling nonlinear dynamics, and improving performance with weak/noisy detectors and during occlusions.

Method: Hybrid tracking combining stochastic and deterministic approaches, using PSO with custom fitness measures to guide particles, integrating social interactions among targets, and implementing a comprehensive state/observation model with space consistency, appearance, detection confidence, track penalties, and social scores.

Result: Superior performance on standard benchmarks and real-world scenarios compared to state-of-the-art trackers, with reduced ID switches and track loss, especially during occlusions.

Conclusion: GenTrack provides an effective solution for robust multi-object tracking with publicly available source code implementations (GenTrack Basic, PSO, and PSO-Social variants) that facilitate flexible reimplementation and fair comparisons.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel multi-object tracking (MOT) method, dubbed
GenTrack, whose main contributions include: a hybrid tracking approach
employing both stochastic and deterministic manners to robustly handle unknown
and time-varying numbers of targets, particularly in maintaining target
identity (ID) consistency and managing nonlinear dynamics, leveraging particle
swarm optimization (PSO) with some proposed fitness measures to guide
stochastic particles toward their target distribution modes, enabling effective
tracking even with weak and noisy object detectors, integration of social
interactions among targets to enhance PSO-guided particles as well as improve
continuous updates of both strong (matched) and weak (unmatched) tracks,
thereby reducing ID switches and track loss, especially during occlusions, a
GenTrack-based redefined visual MOT baseline incorporating a comprehensive
state and observation model based on space consistency, appearance, detection
confidence, track penalties, and social scores for systematic and efficient
target updates, and the first-ever publicly available source-code reference
implementation with minimal dependencies, featuring three variants, including
GenTrack Basic, PSO, and PSO-Social, facilitating flexible reimplementation.

TL;DR: A visual multi-object tracking method combining stochastic particle filtering with deterministic association for consistent target identification under nonlinear dynamics and varying target counts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in multi-object tracking including identifier consistency for unknown/varying target numbers, nonlinear dynamics, and handling occlusions/interactions.

Method: Joint stochastic-deterministic approach: particle filter with PSO optimization for nonlinear dynamics, deterministic association with cost matrix, smooth state updating scheme, and velocity regression from past states.

Result: Superior performance compared to state-of-the-art trackers, with flexible operation for both pre-recorded videos and live camera streams.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid approach effectively maintains identifier consistency and handles complex tracking scenarios, demonstrating improved performance over existing methods.

Abstract: This paper proposes a visual multi-object tracking method that jointly
employs stochastic and deterministic mechanisms to ensure identifier
consistency for unknown and time-varying target numbers under nonlinear
dynamics. A stochastic particle filter addresses nonlinear dynamics and
non-Gaussian noise, with support from particle swarm optimization (PSO) to
guide particles toward state distribution modes and mitigate divergence through
proposed fitness measures incorporating motion consistency, appearance
similarity, and social-interaction cues with neighboring targets. Deterministic
association further enforces identifier consistency via a proposed cost matrix
incorporating spatial consistency between particles and current detections,
detection confidences, and track penalties. Subsequently, a novel scheme is
proposed for the smooth updating of target states while preserving their
identities, particularly for weak tracks during interactions with other targets
and prolonged occlusions. Moreover, velocity regression over past states
provides trend-seed velocities, enhancing particle sampling and state updates.
The proposed tracker is designed to operate flexibly for both pre-recorded
videos and camera live streams, where future frames are unavailable.
Experimental results confirm superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
trackers. The source-code reference implementations of both the proposed method
and compared-trackers are provided on GitHub:

*Ali Ahmad Faour,Nabil Amacha,Ali J. Ghandour*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A sensor-free method using satellite imagery and machine learning to monitor reservoir volume in Lebanon, achieving 95% accuracy in water segmentation and under 1.5% volume estimation error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable sustainable management of the Qaraaoun Reservoir despite sensor malfunctions and limited maintenance capacity by developing a reliable monitoring approach.

Method: Integration of Sentinel-2 and Landsat satellite imagery with a new water segmentation index and Support Vector Regression (SVR) machine learning model trained on bathymetry data to estimate volume from surface area.

Result: Water segmentation aligns with ground truth for >95% of shoreline; SVR model achieves <1.5% error of full capacity and R² >0.98; generates 50 years of time-series data.

Conclusion: The method provides robust, cost-effective, sensor-independent monitoring that can be replicated for other water bodies and supports climate change research.

Abstract: The sustainable management of the Qaraaoun Reservoir, the largest surface
water body in Lebanon located in the Bekaa Plain, depends on reliable
monitoring of its storage volume despite frequent sensor malfunctions and
limited maintenance capacity. This study introduces a sensor-free approach that
integrates open-source satellite imagery, advanced water-extent segmentation,
and machine learning to estimate the reservoir surface area and volume in near
real time. Sentinel-2 and Landsat images are processed, where surface water is
delineated using a newly proposed water segmentation index. A machine learning
model based on Support Vector Regression (SVR) is trained on a curated dataset
that includes water surface area, water level, and water volume calculations
using a reservoir bathymetry survey. The model is then able to estimate
reservoir volume relying solely on surface area extracted from satellite
imagery, without the need for ground measurements. Water segmentation using the
proposed index aligns with ground truth for more than 95 percent of the
shoreline. Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV yields an optimized SVR
performance with error under 1.5 percent of full reservoir capacity and
coefficients of determination exceeding 0.98. These results demonstrate the
robustness and cost-effectiveness of the method, offering a practical solution
for continuous, sensor-independent monitoring of reservoir storage. The
proposed methodology can be replicated for other water bodies, and the
resulting 50 years of time-series data is valuable for research on climate
change and environmental patterns.

*Reem Hammoud,Abdul karim Gizzini,Ali J. Ghandour*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A systematic evaluation framework for explainable AI in semantic segmentation that addresses spatial and contextual complexities using pixel-level evaluation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for transparent and trustworthy AI models in safety-critical domains, with a gap in evaluation strategies specifically for semantic segmentation compared to classification tasks.

Method: Comprehensive evaluation framework with pixel-level evaluation strategies and carefully designed metrics, tested using class activation mapping (CAM)-based XAI schemes.

Result: Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency, robustness, and reliability of the proposed methodology for evaluating XAI in semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: The framework advances transparent, trustworthy, and accountable semantic segmentation models by providing systematic evaluation of explainability methods.

Abstract: Ensuring transparency and trust in artificial intelligence (AI) models is
essential, particularly as they are increasingly applied in safety-critical and
high-stakes domains. Explainable AI (XAI) has emerged as a promising approach
to address this challenge, yet the rigorous evaluation of XAI methods remains
crucial for optimizing the trade-offs between model complexity, predictive
performance, and interpretability. While extensive progress has been achieved
in evaluating XAI techniques for classification tasks, evaluation strategies
tailored to semantic segmentation remain relatively underexplored. This work
introduces a comprehensive and systematic evaluation framework specifically
designed for assessing XAI in semantic segmentation, explicitly accounting for
both spatial and contextual task complexities. The framework employs
pixel-level evaluation strategies and carefully designed metrics to provide
fine-grained interpretability insights. Simulation results using recently
adapted class activation mapping (CAM)-based XAI schemes demonstrate the
efficiency, robustness, and reliability of the proposed methodology. These
findings contribute to advancing transparent, trustworthy, and accountable
semantic segmentation models.

### [55] [Deeply-Conditioned Image Compression via Self-Generated Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24437)
*Zhineng Zhao,Zhihai He,Zikun Zhou,Siwei Ma,Yaowei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCIC-sgp is a learned image compression framework that uses self-generated priors to disentangle global structures from local textures, reducing geometric deformation at low bitrates and achieving significant BD-rate improvements over VVC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current learned image compression methods struggle with modeling complex correlation structures in natural images, particularly the entanglement of invariant global structures with transient local textures, leading to severe geometric deformation at low bitrates.

Method: A functional decomposition framework that first encodes a self-generated prior to capture the image's structural backbone, then uses this prior to holistically modulate the entire compression pipeline, especially the analysis transform, allowing it to focus on residual high-entropy details.

Result: Substantially mitigates geometric deformation artifacts at low bitrates and achieves significant BD-rate reductions of 14.4%, 15.7%, and 15.1% against VTM-12.1 on Kodak, CLIC, and Tecnick datasets respectively.

Conclusion: The deeply-conditioned approach with self-generated priors effectively disentangles information streams and establishes highly competitive performance in learned image compression.

Abstract: Learned image compression (LIC) has shown great promise for achieving high
rate-distortion performance. However, current LIC methods are often limited in
their capability to model the complex correlation structures inherent in
natural images, particularly the entanglement of invariant global structures
with transient local textures within a single monolithic representation. This
limitation precipitates severe geometric deformation at low bitrates. To
address this, we introduce a framework predicated on functional decomposition,
which we term Deeply-Conditioned Image Compression via self-generated priors
(DCIC-sgp). Our central idea is to first encode a potent, self-generated prior
to encapsulate the image's structural backbone. This prior is subsequently
utilized not as mere side-information, but to holistically modulate the entire
compression pipeline. This deep conditioning, most critically of the analysis
transform, liberates it to dedicate its representational capacity to the
residual, high-entropy details. This hierarchical, dependency-driven approach
achieves an effective disentanglement of information streams. Our extensive
experiments validate this assertion; visual analysis demonstrates that our
method substantially mitigates the geometric deformation artifacts that plague
conventional codecs at low bitrates. Quantitatively, our framework establishes
highly competitive performance, achieving significant BD-rate reductions of
14.4%, 15.7%, and 15.1% against the VVC test model VTM-12.1 on the Kodak, CLIC,
and Tecnick datasets.

*Pablo Acuaviva,Aram Davtyan,Mariam Hassan,Sebastian Stapf,Ahmad Rahimi,Alexandre Alahi,Paolo Favaro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) show better data efficiency and compositional understanding than LLMs in visual tasks, suggesting video pretraining provides strong inductive biases for visual foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have succeeded in language but struggle in visual domains with compositional understanding and sample efficiency. The paper investigates if video pretraining can bridge this gap by providing better inductive biases for visual tasks.

Method: Compare pretrained LLMs and VDMs equipped with lightweight adapters on various visual tasks including ARC-AGI, ConceptARC, visual games, route planning, and cellular automata in controlled evaluations.

Result: VDMs demonstrate higher data efficiency across benchmarks compared to their language counterparts, showing better adaptation to visual tasks.

Conclusion: Video pretraining offers inductive biases that support progress toward visual foundation models, making VDMs a promising direction for bridging the gap between language and visual domain capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that large-scale pretraining
enables systems to adapt rapidly to new problems with little supervision in the
language domain. This success, however, has not translated as effectively to
the visual domain, where models, including LLMs, continue to struggle with
compositional understanding, sample efficiency, and general-purpose
problem-solving. We investigate Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) as a promising
direction for bridging this gap. Pretraining on spatiotemporal data endows
these models with strong inductive biases for structure and dynamics, which we
hypothesize can support broad task adaptability. To test this, we design a
controlled evaluation in which both a pretrained LLM and a pretrained VDM are
equipped with lightweight adapters and presented with tasks in their natural
modalities. Across benchmarks including ARC-AGI, ConceptARC, visual games,
route planning, and cellular automata, VDMs demonstrate higher data efficiency
than their language counterparts. Taken together, our results indicate that
video pretraining offers inductive biases that support progress toward visual
foundation models.

*Charles Javerliat,Pierre Raimbaud,Guillaume Lavoué*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Kineo is a calibration-free pipeline for markerless motion capture from unsynchronized, uncalibrated RGB cameras that simultaneously calibrates cameras and reconstructs 3D keypoints at metric scale with high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing calibration-free motion capture approaches suffer from high computational cost and reduced accuracy, limiting accessibility for non-experts and in-the-wild captures.

Method: Uses 2D keypoints from off-the-shelf detectors with confidence-driven spatio-temporal sampling and graph-based global optimization for simultaneous camera calibration and 3D reconstruction, plus pairwise reprojection consensus scoring.

Result: Reduces camera translation error by 83-85%, camera angular error by 86-92%, and world mean-per-joint error by 83-91% compared to prior state-of-the-art methods on EgoHumans and Human3.6M datasets.

Conclusion: Kineo provides an efficient, accurate calibration-free motion capture solution that processes footage faster than real-time in some configurations, making it practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Markerless multiview motion capture is often constrained by the need for
precise camera calibration, limiting accessibility for non-experts and
in-the-wild captures. Existing calibration-free approaches mitigate this
requirement but suffer from high computational cost and reduced reconstruction
accuracy.
  We present Kineo, a fully automatic, calibration-free pipeline for markerless
motion capture from videos captured by unsynchronized, uncalibrated,
consumer-grade RGB cameras. Kineo leverages 2D keypoints from off-the-shelf
detectors to simultaneously calibrate cameras, including Brown-Conrady
distortion coefficients, and reconstruct 3D keypoints and dense scene point
maps at metric scale. A confidence-driven spatio-temporal keypoint sampling
strategy, combined with graph-based global optimization, ensures robust
calibration at a fixed computational cost independent of sequence length. We
further introduce a pairwise reprojection consensus score to quantify 3D
reconstruction reliability for downstream tasks.
  Evaluations on EgoHumans and Human3.6M demonstrate substantial improvements
over prior calibration-free methods. Compared to previous state-of-the-art
approaches, Kineo reduces camera translation error by approximately 83-85%,
camera angular error by 86-92%, and world mean-per-joint error (W-MPJPE) by
83-91%.
  Kineo is also efficient in real-world scenarios, processing multi-view
sequences faster than their duration in specific configuration (e.g., 36min to
process 1h20min of footage). The full pipeline and evaluation code are openly

*Kyungmin Lee,Sihyun Yu,Jinwoo Shin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Decoupled MeanFlow converts pretrained flow models into flow map models without architectural changes, enabling high-quality image generation in 1-4 steps with over 100x faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Denoising generative models like diffusion and flow-based models require many steps due to discretization error, limiting sampling speed. Flow maps can reduce this error but typically need architectural modifications that break compatibility with existing pretrained models.

Method: A simple decoding strategy that conditions the final blocks of diffusion transformers on the subsequent timestep, allowing direct conversion of pretrained flow models into flow maps. Combined with enhanced training techniques.

Result: Achieved 1-step FID of 2.16 on ImageNet 256x256 and 2.12 on 512x512, surpassing prior art. With 4 steps, achieved FID of 1.51 and 1.68, nearly matching flow model performance while providing over 100x faster inference.

Conclusion: Training flow models first and then converting them to flow maps is more efficient than training flow maps from scratch. The method enables fast, high-quality generation while maintaining compatibility with existing pretrained models.

Abstract: Denoising generative models, such as diffusion and flow-based models, produce
high-quality samples but require many denoising steps due to discretization
error. Flow maps, which estimate the average velocity between timesteps,
mitigate this error and enable faster sampling. However, their training
typically demands architectural changes that limit compatibility with
pretrained flow models. We introduce Decoupled MeanFlow, a simple decoding
strategy that converts flow models into flow map models without architectural
modifications. Our method conditions the final blocks of diffusion transformers
on the subsequent timestep, allowing pretrained flow models to be directly
repurposed as flow maps. Combined with enhanced training techniques, this
design enables high-quality generation in as few as 1 to 4 steps. Notably, we
find that training flow models and subsequently converting them is more
efficient and effective than training flow maps from scratch. On ImageNet
256x256 and 512x512, our models attain 1-step FID of 2.16 and 2.12,
respectively, surpassing prior art by a large margin. Furthermore, we achieve
FID of 1.51 and 1.68 when increasing the steps to 4, which nearly matches the
performance of flow models while delivering over 100x faster inference.

*Tinsae G. Dulecha,Leonardo Righetto,Ruggero Pintus,Enrico Gobbetti,Andrea Giachetti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DisK-NeuralRTI uses knowledge distillation to reduce computational costs of NeuralRTI while maintaining quality for reflectance transformation imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RTI methods like PTM and HSH have artifacts in complex reflectance fields, while NeuralRTI has superior quality but is computationally expensive for interactive relighting on limited hardware.

Method: Proposed DisK-NeuralRTI uses knowledge distillation to train smaller networks that approximate the behavior of larger NeuralRTI networks, reducing computational costs while maintaining quality.

Result: The method achieves comparable quality to NeuralRTI but with significantly reduced computational requirements, making interactive relighting feasible on limited hardware.

Conclusion: Knowledge distillation effectively reduces NeuralRTI's computational costs while preserving visual quality, enabling practical RTI applications on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) is very popular for its ability to
visually analyze surfaces by enhancing surface details through interactive
relighting, starting from only a few tens of photographs taken with a fixed
camera and variable illumination. Traditional methods like Polynomial Texture
Maps (PTM) and Hemispherical Harmonics (HSH) are compact and fast, but struggle
to accurately capture complex reflectance fields using few per-pixel
coefficients and fixed bases, leading to artifacts, especially in highly
reflective or shadowed areas. The NeuralRTI approach, which exploits a neural
autoencoder to learn a compact function that better approximates the local
reflectance as a function of light directions, has been shown to produce
superior quality at comparable storage cost. However, as it performs
interactive relighting with custom decoder networks with many parameters, the
rendering step is computationally expensive and not feasible at full resolution
for large images on limited hardware. Earlier attempts to reduce costs by
directly training smaller networks have failed to produce valid results. For
this reason, we propose to reduce its computational cost through a novel
solution based on Knowledge Distillation (DisK-NeuralRTI). ...

TL;DR: Latent Sketchpad is a framework that adds visual planning capabilities to MLLMs by enabling them to generate internal visual representations during reasoning, improving performance on complex visual tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with complex scenarios requiring visual planning and imagination, unlike humans who use sketching for visual thinking. The goal is to equip MLLMs with similar visual reasoning capabilities.

Method: Integrates visual generation into MLLMs' autoregressive reasoning process using two components: Context-Aware Vision Head for producing visual representations and Sketch Decoder for rendering interpretable sketch images.

Result: Experiments on MazePlanning dataset show comparable or superior reasoning performance to backbone MLLMs, with generalization across different models including Gemma3 and Qwen2.5-VL.

Conclusion: The framework successfully extends MLLMs' textual reasoning to visual thinking, enabling richer human-computer interaction and broader applications in visual planning tasks.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at visual understanding,
they often struggle in complex scenarios that require visual planning and
imagination. Inspired by how humans use sketching as a form of visual thinking
to develop and communicate ideas, we introduce Latent Sketchpad, a framework
that equips MLLMs with an internal visual scratchpad. The internal visual
representations of MLLMs have traditionally been confined to perceptual
understanding. We repurpose them to support generative visual thought without
compromising reasoning ability. Building on frontier MLLMs, our approach
integrates visual generation directly into their native autoregressive
reasoning process. It allows the model to interleave textual reasoning with the
generation of visual latents. These latents guide the internal thought process
and can be translated into sketch images for interpretability. To realize this,
we introduce two components: a Context-Aware Vision Head autoregressively
produces visual representations, and a pretrained Sketch Decoder renders these
into human-interpretable images. We evaluate the framework on our new dataset
MazePlanning. Experiments across various MLLMs show that Latent Sketchpad
delivers comparable or even superior reasoning performance to their backbone.
It further generalizes across distinct frontier MLLMs, including Gemma3 and
Qwen2.5-VL. By extending model's textual reasoning to visual thinking, our
framework opens new opportunities for richer human-computer interaction and
broader applications. More details and resources are available on our project

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous evaluations focused mainly on GUI interaction skills while overlooking tool invocation abilities enabled by Model Context Protocol (MCP), creating unfair comparisons between agents with integrated tool invocation and those evaluated only on GUI interaction.

Method: Developed a novel automated code-generation pipeline to create tools and combined them with curated existing tools. Rigorously validated 158 high-quality tools covering 7 common applications for functionality, practical applicability, and versatility.

Result: MCP tools generally improve task success rates (e.g., from 8.3% to 20.4% for OpenAI o3 at 15 steps, from 40.1% to 43.3% for Claude 4 Sonnet at 50 steps). However, even the strongest models have relatively low tool invocation rates (only 36.3%), indicating room for improvement.

Conclusion: OSWorld-MCP deepens understanding of multimodal agents by explicitly measuring MCP tool usage skills and sets a new standard for evaluating performance in complex, tool-assisted environments.

Abstract: With advances in decision-making and reasoning capabilities, multimodal
agents show strong potential in computer application scenarios. Past
evaluations have mainly assessed GUI interaction skills, while tool invocation
abilities, such as those enabled by the Model Context Protocol (MCP), have been
largely overlooked. Comparing agents with integrated tool invocation to those
evaluated only on GUI interaction is inherently unfair. We present OSWorld-MCP,
the first comprehensive and fair benchmark for assessing computer-use agents'
tool invocation, GUI operation, and decision-making abilities in a real-world
environment. We design a novel automated code-generation pipeline to create
tools and combine them with a curated selection from existing tools. Rigorous
manual validation yields 158 high-quality tools (covering 7 common
applications), each verified for correct functionality, practical
applicability, and versatility. Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art
multimodal agents on OSWorld-MCP show that MCP tools generally improve task
success rates (e.g., from 8.3% to 20.4% for OpenAI o3 at 15 steps, from 40.1%

assessing tool invocation capabilities. However, even the strongest models have
relatively low tool invocation rates, Only 36.3%, indicating room for

*Xu Jiang,Huiying Pan,Ligen Shi,Jianing Sun,Wenfeng Xu,Xing Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning method using Gaussian RBF and KAN networks to correct scatter artifacts in CBCT imaging by incorporating physical prior knowledge of scatter distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBCT suffers from scatter artifacts during data acquisition, causing CT value bias and reduced tissue contrast that degrades diagnostic accuracy.

Method: Uses Gaussian Radial Basis Functions to model point scatter function and embeds it into Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks layers to learn high-dimensional scatter features with physical prior knowledge.

Result: Method effectively corrects scatter artifacts in reconstructed images and outperforms current methods in quantitative metrics, validated through synthetic and real-scan experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully combines physical scatter characteristics with KAN's complex function mapping to improve scatter representation and correction in CBCT imaging.

Abstract: Cone-beam CT (CBCT) employs a flat-panel detector to achieve
three-dimensional imaging with high spatial resolution. However, CBCT is
susceptible to scatter during data acquisition, which introduces CT value bias
and reduced tissue contrast in the reconstructed images, ultimately degrading
diagnostic accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a deep learning-based
scatter artifact correction method inspired by physical prior knowledge.
Leveraging the fact that the observed point scatter probability density
distribution exhibits rotational symmetry in the projection domain. The method
uses Gaussian Radial Basis Functions (RBF) to model the point scatter function
and embeds it into the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) layer, which provides
efficient nonlinear mapping capabilities for learning high-dimensional scatter
features. By incorporating the physical characteristics of the scattered photon
distribution together with the complex function mapping capacity of KAN, the
model improves its ability to accurately represent scatter. The effectiveness
of the method is validated through both synthetic and real-scan experiments.
Experimental results show that the model can effectively correct the scatter
artifacts in the reconstructed images and is superior to the current methods in
terms of quantitative metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of generative AI enables creation of highly realistic forged facial images, posing threats to AI security, digital media integrity, and public trust. There's urgent need for robust face forgery detection methods.

Method: Dual-branch CNN with RGB branch for semantic information and frequency branch for high-frequency artifacts. Uses channel attention module for adaptive feature fusion and FSC Loss combining focal loss, supervised contrastive loss, and frequency center margin loss.

Result: Achieves strong performance across all categories on DiFF benchmark (text-to-image, image-to-image, face swap, face edit) and outperforms average human accuracy.

Conclusion: The model demonstrates effectiveness and potential contribution to safeguarding AI ecosystems against visual forgery attacks through its dual-domain approach and unified loss function.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the creation of highly
realistic forged facial images, posing significant threats to AI security,
digital media integrity, and public trust. Face forgery techniques, ranging
from face swapping and attribute editing to powerful diffusion-based image
synthesis, are increasingly being used for malicious purposes such as
misinformation, identity fraud, and defamation. This growing challenge
underscores the urgent need for robust and generalizable face forgery detection
methods as a critical component of AI security infrastructure. In this work, we
propose a novel dual-branch convolutional neural network for face forgery
detection that leverages complementary cues from both spatial and frequency
domains. The RGB branch captures semantic information, while the frequency
branch focuses on high-frequency artifacts that are difficult for generative
models to suppress. A channel attention module is introduced to adaptively fuse
these heterogeneous features, highlighting the most informative channels for
forgery discrimination. To guide the network's learning process, we design a
unified loss function, FSC Loss, that combines focal loss, supervised
contrastive loss, and a frequency center margin loss to enhance class
separability and robustness. We evaluate our model on the DiFF benchmark, which
includes forged images generated from four representative methods:
text-to-image, image-to-image, face swap, and face edit. Our method achieves
strong performance across all categories and outperforms average human
accuracy. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness and its potential
contribution to safeguarding AI ecosystems against visual forgery attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pathologists' diagnostic accuracy averages only 70% and adding a second pathologist doesn't improve consistency, but there's insufficient behavioral data to understand diagnostic errors and inconsistencies.

Method: Collected 18.69 hours of eye-tracking, mouse interaction, stimulus tracking, viewport navigation, and diagnostic decision data from 19 pathologists interpreting 397 whole-slide images using an ecologically valid testbed called PTAH.

Result: Recorded 171,909 fixations, 263,320 saccades, and 1,867,362 mouse interaction events, creating a comprehensive behavioral dataset of pathologists' diagnostic workflow.

Conclusion: The PathoGaze1.0 dataset provides valuable behavioral data that could improve training for both pathologists and AI systems, with all experiments preregistered and the complete dataset publicly available.

Abstract: Interpretation of giga-pixel whole-slide images (WSIs) is an important but
difficult task for pathologists. Their diagnostic accuracy is estimated to
average around 70%. Adding a second pathologist does not substantially improve
decision consistency. The field lacks adequate behavioral data to explain
diagnostic errors and inconsistencies. To fill in this gap, we present
PathoGaze1.0, a comprehensive behavioral dataset capturing the dynamic visual
search and decision-making processes of the full diagnostic workflow during
cancer diagnosis. The dataset comprises 18.69 hours of eye-tracking, mouse
interaction, stimulus tracking, viewport navigation, and diagnostic decision
data (EMSVD) collected from 19 pathologists interpreting 397 WSIs. The data
collection process emphasizes ecological validity through an

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Group Relative Attention Guidance (GRAG), a method to control editing intensity in Diffusion-in-Transformer models by reweighting delta values between tokens and their bias vectors, enabling fine-grained control without additional tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image editing methods using Diffusion-in-Transformer models lack effective control over editing degree, limiting customization capabilities.

Method: Analyzes MM-Attention mechanism in DiT models, identifies bias vectors as inherent editing behavior, and proposes GRAG to reweight delta values between tokens and biases to modulate model focus on input vs editing instruction.

Result: GRAG integrates with existing frameworks in just 4 lines of code, consistently improves editing quality, and provides smoother, more precise control over editing intensity compared to Classifier-Free Guidance.

Conclusion: GRAG enables continuous and fine-grained control over editing intensity in Diffusion-in-Transformer models without requiring any tuning, enhancing editing quality and customization capabilities.

Abstract: Recently, image editing based on Diffusion-in-Transformer models has
undergone rapid development. However, existing editing methods often lack
effective control over the degree of editing, limiting their ability to achieve
more customized results. To address this limitation, we investigate the
MM-Attention mechanism within the DiT model and observe that the Query and Key
tokens share a bias vector that is only layer-dependent. We interpret this bias
as representing the model's inherent editing behavior, while the delta between
each token and its corresponding bias encodes the content-specific editing
signals. Based on this insight, we propose Group Relative Attention Guidance, a
simple yet effective method that reweights the delta values of different tokens
to modulate the focus of the model on the input image relative to the editing
instruction, enabling continuous and fine-grained control over editing
intensity without any tuning. Extensive experiments conducted on existing image
editing frameworks demonstrate that GRAG can be integrated with as few as four
lines of code, consistently enhancing editing quality. Moreover, compared to
the commonly used Classifier-Free Guidance, GRAG achieves smoother and more
precise control over the degree of editing. Our code will be released at

### [67] [SAGE: Structure-Aware Generative Video Transitions between Diverse Clips](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24667)
*Mia Kan,Yilin Liu,Niloy Mitra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAGE is a zero-shot approach for video transitions that combines structural guidance with generative synthesis to create smooth, semantically consistent transitions between diverse clips without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video transition methods struggle with bridging diverse clips involving large temporal gaps or significant semantic differences, creating a need for content-aware and visually coherent transitions.

Method: SAGE combines structural guidance (line maps and motion flow) with generative synthesis, drawing on artistic workflows like aligning silhouettes and interpolating salient features to preserve structure and perceptual continuity.

Result: Extensive experiments show SAGE outperforms both classical and generative baselines (FILM, TVG, DiffMorpher, VACE, GI) on quantitative metrics and user studies for producing transitions between diverse clips.

Conclusion: SAGE provides an effective zero-shot solution for creating high-quality video transitions that maintain structural coherence and semantic consistency across diverse content.

Abstract: Video transitions aim to synthesize intermediate frames between two clips,
but naive approaches such as linear blending introduce artifacts that limit
professional use or break temporal coherence. Traditional techniques
(cross-fades, morphing, frame interpolation) and recent generative inbetweening
methods can produce high-quality plausible intermediates, but they struggle
with bridging diverse clips involving large temporal gaps or significant
semantic differences, leaving a gap for content-aware and visually coherent
transitions. We address this challenge by drawing on artistic workflows,
distilling strategies such as aligning silhouettes and interpolating salient
features to preserve structure and perceptual continuity. Building on this, we
propose SAGE (Structure-Aware Generative vidEo transitions) as a zeroshot
approach that combines structural guidance, provided via line maps and motion
flow, with generative synthesis, enabling smooth, semantically consistent
transitions without fine-tuning. Extensive experiments and comparison with
current alternatives, namely [FILM, TVG, DiffMorpher, VACE, GI], demonstrate
that SAGE outperforms both classical and generative baselines on quantitative
metrics and user studies for producing transitions between diverse clips. Code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIC-BEV is a Transformer-based BEV perception framework for infrastructure-based multi-camera 3D object detection that handles variable camera setups and demonstrates strong robustness under sensor degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing camera-based detection models underperform in infrastructure-based perception due to challenges like multi-view setups, diverse camera configurations, degraded visual inputs, and various road layouts.

Method: Uses a graph-enhanced fusion module to integrate multi-view image features into BEV space by exploiting geometric relationships between cameras and BEV cells alongside latent visual cues. Supports variable number of cameras with heterogeneous parameters.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D object detection on both M2I synthetic dataset and real-world RoScenes dataset. Remains robust under challenging conditions including extreme weather and sensor degradation.

Conclusion: MIC-BEV demonstrates strong potential for real-world deployment in intelligent transportation systems, offering robust infrastructure-based perception with global situational awareness.

Abstract: Infrastructure-based perception plays a crucial role in intelligent
transportation systems, offering global situational awareness and enabling
cooperative autonomy. However, existing camera-based detection models often
underperform in such scenarios due to challenges such as multi-view
infrastructure setup, diverse camera configurations, degraded visual inputs,
and various road layouts. We introduce MIC-BEV, a Transformer-based
bird's-eye-view (BEV) perception framework for infrastructure-based
multi-camera 3D object detection. MIC-BEV flexibly supports a variable number
of cameras with heterogeneous intrinsic and extrinsic parameters and
demonstrates strong robustness under sensor degradation. The proposed
graph-enhanced fusion module in MIC-BEV integrates multi-view image features
into the BEV space by exploiting geometric relationships between cameras and
BEV cells alongside latent visual cues. To support training and evaluation, we
introduce M2I, a synthetic dataset for infrastructure-based object detection,
featuring diverse camera configurations, road layouts, and environmental
conditions. Extensive experiments on both M2I and the real-world dataset
RoScenes demonstrate that MIC-BEV achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D
object detection. It also remains robust under challenging conditions,
including extreme weather and sensor degradation. These results highlight the
potential of MIC-BEV for real-world deployment. The dataset and source code are

### [69] [Does Object Binding Naturally Emerge in Large Pretrained Vision Transformers?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24709)
*Yihao Li,Saeed Salehi,Lyle Ungar,Konrad P. Kording*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Transformers naturally develop object binding capabilities through self-supervised pretraining, with over 90% accuracy in determining whether patches belong to the same object, challenging the view that ViTs lack this cognitive ability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether object binding - the ability to bind features into coherent objects - naturally emerges in pre-trained Vision Transformers, rather than being explicitly imposed through architectural constraints like Slot Attention.

Method: Used similarity probes to decode 'IsSameObject' property from patch embeddings across ViT layers, tested across different pretraining objectives (DINO, MAE, CLIP, ImageNet-supervised), and performed ablation studies to examine the functional role of this capability.

Result: Self-supervised ViTs achieve over 90% accuracy in object binding, while ImageNet-supervised models show markedly weaker performance. IsSameObject is encoded in a low-dimensional subspace and actively guides attention. Ablating this capability degrades downstream performance.

Conclusion: Object binding emerges naturally in self-supervised ViTs as a functional capability that serves the pretraining objective, challenging assumptions that connectionist systems lack symbolic knowledge of object composition.

Abstract: Object binding, the brain's ability to bind the many features that
collectively represent an object into a coherent whole, is central to human
cognition. It groups low-level perceptual features into high-level object
representations, stores those objects efficiently and compositionally in
memory, and supports human reasoning about individual object instances. While
prior work often imposes object-centric attention (e.g., Slot Attention)
explicitly to probe these benefits, it remains unclear whether this ability
naturally emerges in pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs). Intuitively, they
could: recognizing which patches belong to the same object should be useful for
downstream prediction and thus guide attention. Motivated by the quadratic
nature of self-attention, we hypothesize that ViTs represent whether two
patches belong to the same object, a property we term IsSameObject. We decode
IsSameObject from patch embeddings across ViT layers using a similarity probe,
which reaches over 90% accuracy. Crucially, this object-binding capability
emerges reliably in self-supervised ViTs (DINO, MAE, CLIP), but markedly weaker
in ImageNet-supervised models, suggesting that binding is not a trivial
architectural artifact, but an ability acquired through specific pretraining
objectives. We further discover that IsSameObject is encoded in a
low-dimensional subspace on top of object features, and that this signal
actively guides attention. Ablating IsSameObject from model activations
degrades downstream performance and works against the learning objective,
implying that emergent object binding naturally serves the pretraining
objective. Our findings challenge the view that ViTs lack object binding and
highlight how symbolic knowledge of "which parts belong together" emerges
naturally in a connectionist system.

### [70] [Routing Matters in MoE: Scaling Diffusion Transformers with Explicit Routing Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24711)
*Yujie Wei,Shiwei Zhang,Hangjie Yuan,Yujin Han,Zhekai Chen,Jiayu Wang,Difan Zou,Xihui Liu,Yingya Zhang,Yu Liu,Hongming Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProMoE is a novel Mixture-of-Experts framework for Diffusion Transformers that uses a two-step router with explicit routing guidance to address the limitations of applying MoE to visual tokens, achieving state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attempts to apply Mixture-of-Experts to Diffusion Transformers have yielded limited gains due to fundamental differences between language and visual tokens. Visual tokens exhibit spatial redundancy and functional heterogeneity, which hinders expert specialization in vision MoE.

Method: ProMoE features a two-step router with explicit routing guidance: (1) conditional routing partitions image tokens into conditional and unconditional sets based on functional roles, and (2) prototypical routing refines assignments of conditional tokens using learnable prototypes based on semantic content. It also includes a routing contrastive loss to enhance intra-expert coherence and inter-expert diversity.

Result: Extensive experiments on ImageNet benchmark demonstrate that ProMoE surpasses state-of-the-art methods under both Rectified Flow and DDPM training objectives.

Conclusion: The explicit semantic guidance enabled by prototypical routing is crucial for vision MoE, and ProMoE effectively addresses the challenges of applying MoE to visual tokens, achieving superior performance in diffusion models.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for scaling model
capacity while preserving computational efficiency. Despite its notable success
in large language models (LLMs), existing attempts to apply MoE to Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs) have yielded limited gains. We attribute this gap to
fundamental differences between language and visual tokens. Language tokens are
semantically dense with pronounced inter-token variation, while visual tokens
exhibit spatial redundancy and functional heterogeneity, hindering expert
specialization in vision MoE. To this end, we present ProMoE, an MoE framework
featuring a two-step router with explicit routing guidance that promotes expert
specialization. Specifically, this guidance encourages the router to partition
image tokens into conditional and unconditional sets via conditional routing
according to their functional roles, and refine the assignments of conditional
image tokens through prototypical routing with learnable prototypes based on
semantic content. Moreover, the similarity-based expert allocation in latent
space enabled by prototypical routing offers a natural mechanism for
incorporating explicit semantic guidance, and we validate that such guidance is
crucial for vision MoE. Building on this, we propose a routing contrastive loss
that explicitly enhances the prototypical routing process, promoting
intra-expert coherence and inter-expert diversity. Extensive experiments on
ImageNet benchmark demonstrate that ProMoE surpasses state-of-the-art methods
under both Rectified Flow and DDPM training objectives. Code and models will be
made publicly available.

*Haoge Deng,Ting Pan,Fan Zhang,Yang Liu,Zhuoyan Luo,Yufeng Cui,Wenxuan Wang,Chunhua Shen,Shiguang Shan,Zhaoxiang Zhang,Xinlong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: URSA is a discrete generative modeling framework for video generation that bridges the performance gap with continuous methods through global refinement of spatiotemporal tokens with linearized metric paths and resolution-dependent timestep shifting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete approaches for video generation lag behind continuous methods due to error accumulation and long-context inconsistency issues.

Method: URSA formulates video generation as iterative global refinement of discrete spatiotemporal tokens, using Linearized Metric Path and Resolution-dependent Timestep Shifting mechanisms, plus asynchronous temporal fine-tuning for unified tasks.

Result: URSA consistently outperforms existing discrete methods and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art continuous diffusion methods on challenging video and image generation benchmarks.

Conclusion: URSA successfully bridges the gap between discrete and continuous approaches for scalable video generation, enabling efficient high-resolution image synthesis and long-duration video generation with fewer inference steps.

Abstract: Continuous-space video generation has advanced rapidly, while discrete
approaches lag behind due to error accumulation and long-context inconsistency.
In this work, we revisit discrete generative modeling and present Uniform
discRete diffuSion with metric pAth (URSA), a simple yet powerful framework
that bridges the gap with continuous approaches for the scalable video
generation. At its core, URSA formulates the video generation task as an
iterative global refinement of discrete spatiotemporal tokens. It integrates
two key designs: a Linearized Metric Path and a Resolution-dependent Timestep
Shifting mechanism. These designs enable URSA to scale efficiently to
high-resolution image synthesis and long-duration video generation, while
requiring significantly fewer inference steps. Additionally, we introduce an
asynchronous temporal fine-tuning strategy that unifies versatile tasks within
a single model, including interpolation and image-to-video generation.
Extensive experiments on challenging video and image generation benchmarks
demonstrate that URSA consistently outperforms existing discrete methods and
achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art continuous diffusion
methods. Code and models are available at https://github.com/baaivision/URSA

*Chonghyuk Song,Michal Stary,Boyuan Chen,George Kopanas,Vincent Sitzmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Generative View Stitching (GVS) enables collision-free camera-guided video generation by sampling entire sequences in parallel and using diffusion stitching with Omni Guidance for temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive video diffusion models cannot use future conditioning, leading to collisions with generated scenes when following predefined camera trajectories, causing the generation to collapse.

Method: Proposes GVS sampling algorithm that extends diffusion stitching from robot planning to video generation, works with any off-the-shelf video model trained with Diffusion Forcing, and introduces Omni Guidance for past/future conditioning and loop-closing.

Result: GVS achieves stable, collision-free, frame-to-frame consistent camera-guided video generation that closes loops for various predefined camera paths, including impossible geometries like the Impossible Staircase.

Conclusion: GVS successfully addresses the limitations of autoregressive models in camera-guided generation by enabling parallel sampling and future conditioning, producing coherent videos that faithfully follow complex camera trajectories.

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models are capable of long rollouts that are
stable and consistent with history, but they are unable to guide the current
generation with conditioning from the future. In camera-guided video generation
with a predefined camera trajectory, this limitation leads to collisions with
the generated scene, after which autoregression quickly collapses. To address
this, we propose Generative View Stitching (GVS), which samples the entire
sequence in parallel such that the generated scene is faithful to every part of
the predefined camera trajectory. Our main contribution is a sampling algorithm
that extends prior work on diffusion stitching for robot planning to video
generation. While such stitching methods usually require a specially trained
model, GVS is compatible with any off-the-shelf video model trained with
Diffusion Forcing, a prevalent sequence diffusion framework that we show
already provides the affordances necessary for stitching. We then introduce
Omni Guidance, a technique that enhances the temporal consistency in stitching
by conditioning on both the past and future, and that enables our proposed
loop-closing mechanism for delivering long-range coherence. Overall, GVS
achieves camera-guided video generation that is stable, collision-free,
frame-to-frame consistent, and closes loops for a variety of predefined camera
paths, including Oscar Reutersv\"ard's Impossible Staircase. Results are best
viewed as videos at https://andrewsonga.github.io/gvs.

*Phuong Q. Dao,Mark Roantree,Vuong M. Ngo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes BERT-ViT-EF and DTCN models for multimodal sentiment analysis using early fusion of text (BERT) and image (ViT) encoders, with DTCN adding contrastive learning and deeper contextual modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve multimodal sentiment analysis by enabling deeper cross-modal interactions and more effective joint representation learning than unimodal approaches.

Method: BERT-ViT-EF combines BERT and ViT encoders via early fusion. DTCN extends this with additional Transformer layer for text refinement and contrastive learning to align text-image representations.

Result: DTCN achieves 78.4% accuracy and 78.3% F1-score on TumEmo, and 76.6% accuracy and 75.9% F1-score on MVSA-Single, outperforming previous methods.

Conclusion: Early fusion and deeper contextual modeling in Transformer-based architectures significantly enhance multimodal sentiment analysis performance.

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) seeks to understand human emotions by
jointly analyzing data from multiple modalities typically text and images
offering a richer and more accurate interpretation than unimodal approaches. In
this paper, we first propose BERT-ViT-EF, a novel model that combines powerful
Transformer-based encoders BERT for textual input and ViT for visual input
through an early fusion strategy. This approach facilitates deeper cross-modal
interactions and more effective joint representation learning. To further
enhance the model's capability, we propose an extension called the Dual
Transformer Contrastive Network (DTCN), which builds upon BERT-ViT-EF. DTCN
incorporates an additional Transformer encoder layer after BERT to refine
textual context (before fusion) and employs contrastive learning to align text
and image representations, fostering robust multimodal feature learning.
Empirical results on two widely used MSA benchmarks MVSA-Single and TumEmo
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. DTCN achieves best accuracy
(78.4%) and F1-score (78.3%) on TumEmo, and delivers competitive performance on
MVSA-Single, with 76.6% accuracy and 75.9% F1-score. These improvements
highlight the benefits of early fusion and deeper contextual modeling in
Transformer-based multimodal sentiment analysis.

### [74] [Speeding Up MACE: Low-Precision Tricks for Equivarient Force Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23621)
*Alexandre Benoit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This thesis demonstrates that SO(3)-equivariant force fields like MACE can be significantly accelerated through GPU-optimized kernels (cuEquivariance) and mixed-precision arithmetic (BF16/FP16) while maintaining physical accuracy in molecular dynamics simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine-learning force fields like MACE provide accurate molecular dynamics but at high computational cost. There is limited systematic evidence on whether reduced-precision arithmetic and GPU-optimized kernels can reduce this cost without compromising physical fidelity.

Method: Profiled MACE end-to-end and per block, compared e3nn and cuEquivariance backends, evaluated FP64/FP32/BF16/FP16 precision settings with FP32 accumulation for inference, NVT/NPT water simulations, and training runs under reproducible timing conditions.

Result: cuEquivariance reduced inference latency by ~3x. Casting only linear layers to BF16/FP16 within FP32 models yielded ~4x additional speedups while maintaining energy and thermodynamic accuracy. Half-precision training degraded force RMSE. Mixed backends without adapters caused representation mismatches.

Conclusion: Fused equivariant kernels and mixed-precision inference can substantially accelerate state-of-the-art force fields with negligible impact on MD. Recommended policy: use cuEquivariance with FP32 by default, enable BF16/FP16 for linear layers with FP32 accumulation for maximum throughput, while keeping training in FP32.

Abstract: Machine-learning force fields can deliver accurate molecular dynamics (MD) at
high computational cost. For SO(3)-equivariant models such as MACE, there is
little systematic evidence on whether reduced-precision arithmetic and
GPU-optimized kernels can cut this cost without harming physical fidelity. This
thesis aims to make MACE cheaper and faster while preserving accuracy by
identifying computational bottlenecks and evaluating low-precision execution
policies. We profile MACE end-to-end and per block, compare the e3nn and NVIDIA
cuEquivariance backends, and assess FP64/FP32/BF16/FP16 settings (with FP32
accumulation) for inference, short NVT and long NPT water simulations, and toy
training runs under reproducible, steady-state timing. cuEquivariance reduces
inference latency by about $3\times$. Casting only linear layers to BF16/FP16
within an FP32 model yields roughly 4x additional speedups, while energies and
thermodynamic observables in NVT/NPT MD remain within run-to-run variability.
Half-precision weights during training degrade force RMSE. Mixing e3nn and cuEq
modules without explicit adapters causes representation mismatches. Fused
equivariant kernels and mixed-precision inference can substantially accelerate
state-of-the-art force fields with negligible impact on downstream MD. A
practical policy is to use cuEquivariance with FP32 by default and enable
BF16/FP16 for linear layers (keeping FP32 accumulations) for maximum
throughput, while training remains in FP32. Further gains are expected on
Ampere/Hopper GPUs (TF32/BF16) and from kernel-level FP16/BF16 paths and
pipeline fusion.

TL;DR: Adversarial attacks threaten healthcare AI by causing dangerous misclassifications, especially impacting underserved populations. The study demonstrates vulnerabilities in dermatological AI through threat modeling and shows partial defense effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial attacks pose severe risks to healthcare AI systems, potentially causing treatment delays and misdiagnoses that threaten patient safety, particularly in vulnerable populations.

Method: Empirical experimentation on dermatological dataset using threat modeling, experimental benchmarking, and model evaluation to test adversarial attacks and defenses like adversarial training and distillation.

Result: Adversarial methods significantly reduce classification accuracy. Defenses reduce attack success rates but must be balanced against model performance on clean data.

Conclusion: Integrated technical, ethical, and policy-based approaches are needed to build more resilient and equitable AI in healthcare.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a severe risk to AI systems used in healthcare,
capable of misleading models into dangerous misclassifications that can delay
treatments or cause misdiagnoses. These attacks, often imperceptible to human
perception, threaten patient safety, particularly in underserved populations.
Our study explores these vulnerabilities through empirical experimentation on a
dermatological dataset, where adversarial methods significantly reduce
classification accuracy. Through detailed threat modeling, experimental
benchmarking, and model evaluation, we demonstrate both the severity of the
threat and the partial success of defenses like adversarial training and
distillation. Our results show that while defenses reduce attack success rates,
they must be balanced against model performance on clean data. We conclude with
a call for integrated technical, ethical, and policy-based approaches to build
more resilient, equitable AI in healthcare.

*Xun Su,Hiroyuki Kasai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Noise Combination Sampling, a method that synthesizes optimal noise from a subspace to approximate measurement scores, enabling natural integration of conditional information in diffusion models for inverse problems without hyperparameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the dilemma in zero-shot inverse problem solving where excessive observation integration disrupts generation while insufficient integration fails to enforce constraints.

Method: Noise Combination Sampling synthesizes an optimal noise vector from a noise subspace to approximate the measurement score, replacing standard noise in DDPM process to embed conditional information naturally.

Result: Achieves superior performance with negligible computational overhead, especially when generation steps are small, significantly improving robustness and stability across various inverse problem solvers including image compression.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables effective conditional information integration in diffusion models for inverse problems without step-wise hyperparameter tuning, demonstrating strong performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Pretrained diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in
zero-shot inverse problem solving by incorporating observation information into
the generation process of the diffusion models. However, this presents an
inherent dilemma: excessive integration can disrupt the generative process,
while insufficient integration fails to emphasize the constraints imposed by
the inverse problem. To address this, we propose \emph{Noise Combination
Sampling}, a novel method that synthesizes an optimal noise vector from a noise
subspace to approximate the measurement score, replacing the noise term in the
standard Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models process. This enables
conditional information to be naturally embedded into the generation process
without reliance on step-wise hyperparameter tuning. Our method can be applied
to a wide range of inverse problem solvers, including image compression, and,
particularly when the number of generation steps $T$ is small, achieves
superior performance with negligible computational overhead, significantly
improving robustness and stability.

### [77] [DiNo and RanBu: Lightweight Predictions from Shallow Random Forests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23624)
*Tiago Mendonça dos Santos,Rafael Izbicki,Luís Gustavo Esteves*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiNo and RanBu are shallow-forest methods that convert depth-limited trees into efficient distance-weighted predictors, achieving comparable accuracy to full-depth random forests with up to 95% reduction in training and inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random Forest ensembles have high inference latency and memory demands due to reliance on hundreds of deep trees, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive or resource-constrained environments.

Method: DiNo measures cophenetic distances via most recent common ancestor of observation pairs, while RanBu applies kernel smoothing to Breiman's classical proximity measure. Both operate after forest training with no additional trees grown, using lightweight matrix-vector operations for parameter tuning.

Result: RanBu matches or exceeds full-depth random forest accuracy, particularly in high-noise settings, with up to 95% reduction in training plus inference time. DiNo achieves best bias-variance trade-off in low-noise regimes at modest computational cost. Both methods extend to quantile regression with substantial speed gains.

Conclusion: DiNo and RanBu provide efficient alternatives to full-depth random forests, maintaining accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs, making them suitable for latency-sensitive and resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Random Forest ensembles are a strong baseline for tabular prediction tasks,
but their reliance on hundreds of deep trees often results in high inference
latency and memory demands, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive or
resource-constrained environments. We introduce DiNo (Distance with Nodes) and
RanBu (Random Bushes), two shallow-forest methods that convert a small set of
depth-limited trees into efficient, distance-weighted predictors. DiNo measures
cophenetic distances via the most recent common ancestor of observation pairs,
while RanBu applies kernel smoothing to Breiman's classical proximity measure.
Both approaches operate entirely after forest training: no additional trees are
grown, and tuning of the single bandwidth parameter $h$ requires only
lightweight matrix-vector operations. Across three synthetic benchmarks and 25
public datasets, RanBu matches or exceeds the accuracy of full-depth random
forests-particularly in high-noise settings-while reducing training plus
inference time by up to 95\%. DiNo achieves the best bias-variance trade-off in
low-noise regimes at a modest computational cost. Both methods extend directly
to quantile regression, maintaining accuracy with substantial speed gains. The
implementation is available as an open-source R/C++ package at
https://github.com/tiagomendonca/dirf. We focus on structured tabular random
samples (i.i.d.), leaving extensions to other modalities for future work.

*Shuang Geng,Wenli Zhang,Jiaheng Xie,Rui Wang,Sudha Ram*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A closed-loop LLM-Knowledge Graph framework that integrates depression detection from social media with continuous medical knowledge expansion through iterative learning cycles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of prior studies that use medical knowledge for prediction but don't expand such knowledge through the predictive process itself.

Method: Developed a two-phase framework: 1) Knowledge-aware depression detection using LLM for joint prediction and entity extraction, with knowledge graph weighting entities; 2) Knowledge refinement and expansion where new entities/relationships are incorporated into the knowledge graph under expert supervision.

Result: The framework enhanced both predictive accuracy and medical understanding, with expert evaluations confirming discovery of clinically meaningful symptoms, comorbidities, and social triggers complementary to existing literature.

Conclusion: Successfully demonstrated the co-evolution of computational models and domain knowledge through mutually reinforcing prediction-through-learning and learning-through-prediction processes, providing a foundation for adaptive knowledge systems in dynamic risk monitoring.

Abstract: Social media user-generated content (UGC) provides real-time, self-reported
indicators of mental health conditions such as depression, offering a valuable
source for predictive analytics. While prior studies integrate medical
knowledge to improve prediction accuracy, they overlook the opportunity to
simultaneously expand such knowledge through predictive processes. We develop a
Closed-Loop Large Language Model (LLM)-Knowledge Graph framework that
integrates prediction and knowledge expansion in an iterative learning cycle.
In the knowledge-aware depression detection phase, the LLM jointly performs
depression detection and entity extraction, while the knowledge graph
represents and weights these entities to refine prediction performance. In the
knowledge refinement and expansion phase, new entities, relationships, and
entity types extracted by the LLM are incorporated into the knowledge graph
under expert supervision, enabling continual knowledge evolution. Using
large-scale UGC, the framework enhances both predictive accuracy and medical
understanding. Expert evaluations confirmed the discovery of clinically
meaningful symptoms, comorbidities, and social triggers complementary to
existing literature. We conceptualize and operationalize
prediction-through-learning and learning-through-prediction as mutually
reinforcing processes, advancing both methodological and theoretical
understanding in predictive analytics. The framework demonstrates the
co-evolution of computational models and domain knowledge, offering a
foundation for adaptive, data-driven knowledge systems applicable to other
dynamic risk monitoring contexts.

*Yuxiao Wen,Yanjun Han,Zhengyuan Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel elimination algorithm for combinatorial bandits that partitions arms into confirmed, active, and eliminated categories with explicit exploration, achieving near-optimal regret in graph feedback and linear contextual settings where UCB methods fail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Combinatorial bandits involve selecting multiple arms per round for applications like online recommendation, but adapting arm elimination methods has been challenging compared to UCB extensions.

Method: Introduces an elimination scheme with three arm categories (confirmed, active, eliminated) and incorporates explicit exploration to update these sets.

Result: Achieves near-optimal regret in combinatorial multi-armed bandit with general graph feedback and combinatorial linear contextual bandit, outperforming UCB-based methods which can provably fail due to insufficient exploration.

Conclusion: The proposed elimination algorithm successfully addresses limitations of UCB methods in combinatorial bandits through explicit exploration, with matching lower bounds provided.

Abstract: Combinatorial bandits extend the classical bandit framework to settings where
the learner selects multiple arms in each round, motivated by applications such
as online recommendation and assortment optimization. While extensions of upper
confidence bound (UCB) algorithms arise naturally in this context, adapting arm
elimination methods has proved more challenging. We introduce a novel
elimination scheme that partitions arms into three categories (confirmed,
active, and eliminated), and incorporates explicit exploration to update these
sets. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm in two settings: the
combinatorial multi-armed bandit with general graph feedback, and the
combinatorial linear contextual bandit. In both cases, our approach achieves
near-optimal regret, whereas UCB-based methods can provably fail due to
insufficient explicit exploration. Matching lower bounds are also provided.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TracePile is a large-scale corpus that transforms code execution into explicit chain-of-execution rationales to improve LLM reasoning, showing consistent performance gains across multiple models and benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current training on raw code is suboptimal because reasoning is often implicit and entangled with syntactic noise. There's a need to make code-based reasoning more explicit for better LLM training.

Method: Created TracePile corpus with 2.6M samples that convert code execution into step-by-step chain-of-execution rationales. Enriched with variable-tracing questions and code rewritings. Evaluated using three training setups: continue-pretraining, instruction tuning, and two-stage finetuning.

Result: Consistent improvements across four base models (LLaMA 3, LLaMA 3.1, Qwen-2.5, Qwen-2.5 Coder) and 20 benchmarks. LLaMA3.1-8B improved by 7.1% on average across nine math datasets, with clear gains on LiveCodeBench, CRUX, and MMLU.

Conclusion: TracePile effectively enhances LLM reasoning by making code execution explicit through chain-of-execution rationales, demonstrating broad applicability across mathematical, coding, logical, and algorithmic reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Building robust and general reasoning ability is a central goal in the
development of large language models (LLMs). Recent efforts increasingly turn
to code as a rich training source, given its inherent logical structure and
diverse reasoning paradigms such as divide-and-conquer, topological ordering,
and enumeration. However, reasoning in code is often expressed implicitly and
entangled with syntactic or implementation noise, making direct training on raw
code suboptimal.To address this, we introduce TracePile, a large-scale corpus
of 2.6 million samples that transforms code execution into explicit,
step-by-step chain-of-thought-style rationales, which we call Chain of
Execution (CoE). The corpus spans domains including mathematics, classical
algorithms and algorithmic competition, and is enriched with variable-tracing
questions and code rewritings to enhance logical granularity and code
diversity. We evaluate TracePile using three training setups:
continue-pretraining, instruction tuning after pretraining, and two-stage
finetuning. Experiments across four base models (LLaMA 3, LLaMA 3.1, Qwen-2.5,
and Qwen-2.5 Coder) and 20 benchmarks covering math, code, logic, and
algorithms demonstrate consistent improvements. Notably, TracePile boosts
LLaMA3.1-8B by 7.1\% on average across nine math datasets and delivers clear
gains on LiveCodeBench, CRUX, and MMLU under two-stage fine-tuning.

### [81] [Information-Theoretic Discrete Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24088)
*Moongyu Jeon,Sangwoo Shin,Dongjae Jeon,Albert No*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An information-theoretic framework for discrete diffusion models that provides principled estimators of log-likelihood using score-matching losses, with theoretical foundations and practical extensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish principled connections between mutual information and denoising losses in discrete diffusion models, moving beyond variational bounds to tight estimators of log-likelihood.

Method: Derived Information-Minimum Denoising Score Entropy (I-MDSE) relation for discrete diffusion and Information-Minimum Denoising Cross-Entropy (I-MDCE) for masked diffusion, providing time-integral decomposition of log-likelihood.

Result: The framework shows that commonly used losses (DSE and DCE) are tight estimators of log-likelihood, enables practical extensions like time-free formulas and conditional likelihood estimation, with experimental validation on synthetic and real-world data.

Conclusion: The proposed information-theoretic framework provides accurate, variance-stable estimators of log-likelihood for discrete diffusion models, with theoretical guarantees and practical utility.

Abstract: We present an information-theoretic framework for discrete diffusion models
that yields principled estimators of log-likelihood using score-matching
losses. Inspired by the I-MMSE identity for the Gaussian setup, we derive
analogous results for the discrete setting. Specifically, we introduce the
Information-Minimum Denoising Score Entropy (I-MDSE) relation, which links
mutual information between data and its diffused version to the minimum
denoising score entropy (DSE) loss. We extend this theory to masked diffusion
and establish the Information-Minimum Denoising Cross-Entropy (I-MDCE)
relation, connecting cross-entropy losses to mutual information in discrete
masked processes. These results provide a time-integral decomposition of the
log-likelihood of the data in terms of optimal score-based losses, showing that
commonly used losses such as DSE and DCE are not merely variational bounds but
tight and principled estimators of log-likelihood. The I-MDCE decomposition
further enables practical extensions, including time-free formula, conditional
likelihood estimation in prompt-response tasks, and coupled Monte Carlo
estimation of likelihood ratios. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data
confirm the accuracy, variance stability, and utility of our estimators. The
code is publicly available at https://github.com/Dongjae0324/infodis.

*Ninghui Feng,Yiyan Qi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces number-to-event reasoning, a task that infers structured events from numerical time-series data, addressing limitations in LLMs' numerical understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have strong multimodal reasoning but limited understanding of numerical time-series signals. Existing approaches focus on forecasting without uncovering latent events or explaining reasoning processes.

Method: Proposes a reasoning-aware framework with agent-guided event extractor (AGE), marked multivariate Hawkes-based synthetic generator (EveDTS), and two-stage fine-tuning combining time-series encoder with structured decoder.

Result: Experiments on multi-domain datasets show substantial outperformance over strong LLM baselines in event-level precision and recall.

Conclusion: The work bridges quantitative reasoning and semantic understanding, enabling LLMs to explain and predict events directly from numerical dynamics.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive multimodal
reasoning capabilities, yet their understanding of purely numerical time-series
signals remains limited. Existing approaches mainly focus on forecasting or
trend description, without uncovering the latent events that drive numerical
changes or explaining the reasoning process behind them. In this work, we
introduce the task of number-to-event reasoning and decoding, which aims to
infer interpretable structured events from numerical inputs, even when current
text is unavailable. To address the data scarcity and semantic alignment
challenges, we propose a reasoning-aware framework that integrates an
agent-guided event extractor (AGE), a marked multivariate Hawkes-based
synthetic generator (EveDTS), and a two-stage fine-tuning pipeline combining a
time-series encoder with a structured decoder. Our model explicitly reasons
over numerical changes, generates intermediate explanations, and outputs
structured event hypotheses. Experiments on multi-domain datasets show that our
method substantially outperforms strong LLM baselines in event-level precision
and recall. These results suggest a new direction for bridging quantitative
reasoning and semantic understanding, enabling LLMs to explain and predict
events directly from numerical dynamics.

### [83] [Greedy Sampling Is Provably Efficient for RLHF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24700)
*Di Wu,Chengshuai Shi,Jing Yang,Cong Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides theoretical analysis of RLHF with general preference models, showing that greedy sampling achieves order-wise better performance guarantees than existing optimistic/pessimistic approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Theoretical understanding of RLHF is limited, especially for general preference models beyond Bradley-Terry. Existing methods use optimism/pessimism but may not be optimal.

Method: Analyzes RLHF with general preference models using empirical estimates (greedy sampling) rather than optimistic/pessimistic estimates. Leverages structural properties of optimal policy under KL-regularized targets.

Result: Obtains performance guarantees with major, order-wise improvements over existing methods. Shows greedy sampling is surprisingly sufficient for RLHF, especially specialized to Bradley-Terry model.

Conclusion: Greedy sampling provides superior theoretical guarantees for RLHF compared to optimistic/pessimistic approaches, revealing unique structural properties of KL-regularized optimal policies.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key
technique for post-training large language models. Despite its empirical
success, the theoretical understanding of RLHF is still limited, as learning
the KL-regularized target with only preference feedback poses additional
challenges compared with canonical RL. Existing works mostly study the
reward-based Bradley-Terry (BT) preference model, and extend classical designs
utilizing optimism or pessimism. This work, instead, considers the general
preference model (whose practical relevance has been observed recently) and
obtains performance guarantees with major, order-wise improvements over
existing ones. Surprisingly, these results are derived from algorithms that
directly use the empirical estimates (i.e., greedy sampling), as opposed to
constructing optimistic or pessimistic estimates in previous works. This
insight has a deep root in the unique structural property of the optimal policy
class under the KL-regularized target, and we further specialize it to the BT
model, highlighting the surprising sufficiency of greedy sampling in RLHF.

### [84] [Beyond Pairwise: Empowering LLM Alignment With Ranked Choice Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23631)
*Yuxuan Tang,Yifan Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RCPO is a unified framework that bridges preference optimization with ranked choice modeling via maximum likelihood estimation, supporting both utility-based and rank-based choice models and outperforming existing pairwise methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM alignment relies on pairwise preference optimization, which overlooks richer forms of human feedback like multiwise comparisons and top-k rankings.

Method: Proposed Ranked Choice Preference Optimization (RCPO) framework using maximum likelihood estimation, instantiated with Multinomial Logit and Mallows-RMJ choice models.

Result: RCPO consistently outperforms competitive baselines on Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-it across AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard benchmarks.

Conclusion: Directly leveraging ranked preference data with appropriate choice models yields more effective alignment and provides a versatile foundation for incorporating choice modeling into LLM training.

Abstract: Alignment of large language models (LLMs) has predominantly relied on
pairwise preference optimization, where annotators select the better of two
responses to a prompt. While simple, this approach overlooks the opportunity to
learn from richer forms of human feedback, such as multiwise comparisons and
top-$k$ rankings. We propose Ranked Choice Preference Optimization (RCPO), a
unified framework that bridges preference optimization with (ranked) choice
modeling via maximum likelihood estimation. The framework is flexible,
supporting both utility-based and rank-based choice models. It subsumes several
existing pairwise methods (e.g., DPO, SimPO), while providing principled
training objectives for richer feedback formats. We instantiate this framework
with two representative ranked choice models (Multinomial Logit and
Mallows-RMJ). Empirical studies on Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-it across
AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard benchmarks show that RCPO consistently outperforms
competitive baselines. RCPO shows how directly leveraging ranked preference
data, combined with the right choice models, yields more effective alignment.
It offers a versatile and extensible foundation for incorporating (ranked)
choice modeling into LLM training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMCOMP is a novel lossy compression method that uses decoder-only large language models to compress scientific spatiotemporal data, achieving up to 30% higher compression ratios than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining strict error bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of high-resolution scientific simulations and observation systems is generating massive spatiotemporal datasets, making efficient, error-bounded compression increasingly important. Decoder-only LLMs have shown remarkable capabilities in modeling complex sequential data.

Method: LLMCOMP quantizes 3D fields into discrete tokens, arranges them via Z-order curves to preserve locality, and applies coverage-guided sampling for training efficiency. An autoregressive transformer with spatial-temporal embeddings models token transitions. During compression, it performs top-k prediction, storing only rank indices and fallback corrections to ensure error bounds.

Result: Experiments on multiple reanalysis datasets show LLMCOMP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art compressors, achieving up to 30% higher compression ratios under strict error bounds.

Conclusion: These results highlight the potential of LLMs as general-purpose compressors for high-fidelity scientific data.

Abstract: The rapid growth of high-resolution scientific simulations and observation
systems is generating massive spatiotemporal datasets, making efficient,
error-bounded compression increasingly important. Meanwhile, decoder-only large
language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in modeling
complex sequential data. In this paper, we propose LLMCOMP, a novel lossy

Z-order curves to preserve locality, and applies coverage-guided sampling to
enhance training efficiency. An autoregressive transformer is then trained with
spatial-temporal embeddings to model token transitions. During compression, the
model performs top-k prediction, storing only rank indices and fallback
corrections to ensure strict error bounds. Experiments on multiple reanalysis
datasets show that LLMCOMP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art

### [86] [Monotone and Separable Set Functions: Characterizations and Neural Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23634)
*Soutrik Sarangi,Yonatan Sverdlov,Nadav Dym,Abir De*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Monotone and Separating (MAS) set functions that preserve set containment relationships through vector embeddings, establishes theoretical bounds, and demonstrates practical benefits for set containment tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Applications for set containment problems require functions that preserve the natural partial order on sets, where set inclusion corresponds to vector ordering.

Method: Design set-to-vector functions that satisfy MAS property, establish theoretical bounds on vector dimensions, and provide a weakly MAS model for infinite ground sets with Holder continuity stability.

Result: MAS functions don't exist for infinite ground sets, but a weakly MAS model is proposed. MAS functions enable construction of universal monotone models that approximate all monotone set functions.

Conclusion: The proposed MAS embedding model shows experimental benefits for set containment tasks compared to standard set models, providing better inductive bias for containment relationships.

Abstract: Motivated by applications for set containment problems, we consider the
following fundamental problem: can we design set-to-vector functions so that
the natural partial order on sets is preserved, namely $S\subseteq T \text{ if
and only if } F(S)\leq F(T) $. We call functions satisfying this property
Monotone and Separating (MAS) set functions. % We establish lower and upper
bounds for the vector dimension necessary to obtain MAS functions, as a
function of the cardinality of the multisets and the underlying ground set. In
the important case of an infinite ground set, we show that MAS functions do not
exist, but provide a model called our which provably enjoys a relaxed MAS
property we name "weakly MAS" and is stable in the sense of Holder continuity.
We also show that MAS functions can be used to construct universal models that
are monotone by construction and can approximate all monotone set functions.
Experimentally, we consider a variety of set containment tasks. The experiments
show the benefit of using our our model, in comparison with standard set models
which do not incorporate set containment as an inductive bias. Our code is
available in https://github.com/yonatansverdlov/Monotone-Embedding.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates Skeptical Learning (SKEL) in real-world conditions with actual users who can refine input labels, showing reduced annotation effort and improved data quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digital personal assistants require high-quality annotations but user annotations often contain errors and noise. Previous SKEL research lacked end-user confirmation, which is crucial for accurate context evaluation.

Method: Conducted a study with university students using the iLog mobile application over four weeks, allowing users to refine input labels based on their current perspectives and needs.

Result: The study revealed challenges in balancing user effort and data quality, but demonstrated that SKEL can reduce annotation effort while improving the quality of collected data.

Conclusion: SKEL shows potential benefits for real-world applications by enabling reduced annotation effort and enhanced data quality through user refinement of labels.

Abstract: Any digital personal assistant, whether used to support task performance,
answer questions, or manage work and daily life, including fitness schedules,
requires high-quality annotations to function properly. However, user
annotations, whether actively produced or inferred from context (e.g., data
from smartphone sensors), are often subject to errors and noise. Previous
research on Skeptical Learning (SKEL) addressed the issue of noisy labels by
comparing offline active annotations with passive data, allowing for an
evaluation of annotation accuracy. However, this evaluation did not include
confirmation from end-users, the best judges of their own context. In this
study, we evaluate SKEL's performance in real-world conditions with actual
users who can refine the input labels based on their current perspectives and
needs. The study involves university students using the iLog mobile application
on their devices over a period of four weeks. The results highlight the
challenges of finding the right balance between user effort and data quality,
as well as the potential benefits of using SKEL, which include reduced
annotation effort and improved quality of collected data.

Conclusion: Linguistic understanding combined with cross-modality adaptation of trajectory information enhances delay prediction, demonstrating practicality and scalability for real-world operations.

Abstract: Flight delay prediction has become a key focus in air traffic management, as
delays highlight inefficiencies that impact overall network performance. This
paper presents a lightweight large language model-based multimodal flight delay
prediction, formulated from the perspective of air traffic controllers
monitoring aircraft delay after entering the terminal area. The approach
integrates trajectory representations with textual aeronautical information,
including flight information, weather reports, and aerodrome notices, by
adapting trajectory data into the language modality to capture airspace
conditions. Experimental results show that the model consistently achieves
sub-minute prediction error by effectively leveraging contextual information
related to the sources of delay. The framework demonstrates that linguistic
understanding, when combined with cross-modality adaptation of trajectory
information, enhances delay prediction. Moreover, the approach shows
practicality and scalability for real-world operations, supporting real-time
updates that refine predictions upon receiving new operational information.

Result: Achieves average 2.7% improvement over best-performing baselines across 29 benchmark tasks, ranking first on 22 tasks including 27% improvement on LD50 task.

Conclusion: MuMo demonstrates robustness to 3D conformer noise and effective multimodal fusion in molecular representation, validated by superior performance across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Multimodal molecular models often suffer from 3D conformer unreliability and
modality collapse, limiting their robustness and generalization. We propose
MuMo, a structured multimodal fusion framework that addresses these challenges
in molecular representation through two key strategies. To reduce the
instability of conformer-dependent fusion, we design a Structured Fusion

stable structural prior. To mitigate modality collapse caused by naive fusion,
we introduce a Progressive Injection (PI) mechanism that asymmetrically
integrates this prior into the sequence stream, preserving modality-specific
modeling while enabling cross-modal enrichment. Built on a state space
backbone, MuMo supports long-range dependency modeling and robust information
propagation. Across 29 benchmark tasks from Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC) and

TL;DR: SAL-T is a linear transformer with spatial partitioning that achieves comparable performance to full-attention transformers for jet classification while using fewer resources and lower latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers are effective for particle collision analysis but have quadratic complexity that makes them impractical for high-throughput environments like CERN LHC due to resource demands and latency issues.

Method: Spatially aware linear transformer (SAL-T) that partitions particles based on kinematic features, computes attention between physically significant regions, and uses convolutional layers to capture local correlations informed by jet physics.

Result: Outperforms standard linformer in jet classification tasks, achieves comparable results to full-attention transformers, and shows similar trends on ModelNet10 point cloud classification dataset.

Conclusion: SAL-T provides an efficient alternative to full-attention transformers for high-energy physics applications, maintaining performance while significantly reducing computational resources and inference latency.

Abstract: Transformers are very effective in capturing both global and local
correlations within high-energy particle collisions, but they present
deployment challenges in high-data-throughput environments, such as the CERN
LHC. The quadratic complexity of transformer models demands substantial
resources and increases latency during inference. In order to address these
issues, we introduce the Spatially Aware Linear Transformer (SAL-T), a
physics-inspired enhancement of the linformer architecture that maintains
linear attention. Our method incorporates spatially aware partitioning of
particles based on kinematic features, thereby computing attention between
regions of physical significance. Additionally, we employ convolutional layers
to capture local correlations, informed by insights from jet physics. In
addition to outperforming the standard linformer in jet classification tasks,
SAL-T also achieves classification results comparable to full-attention
transformers, while using considerably fewer resources with lower latency
during inference. Experiments on a generic point cloud classification dataset
(ModelNet10) further confirm this trend. Our code is available at

TL;DR: LRQK is a two-stage framework that reduces KV cache memory usage in LLMs by decomposing query and key matrices into low-rank factors, enabling efficient long-context inference with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing length of input text in LLMs leads to prohibitive GPU memory costs from KV cache, limiting long-context inference on resource-constrained devices. Existing methods like quantization and pruning suffer from precision loss or suboptimal KV pair retention.

Method: LRQK decomposes full-precision query and key matrices into compact rank-r factors during prefill, computes proxy attention scores in O(lr) time at decode steps, and uses a mixed GPU-CPU cache with hit-and-miss mechanism that transfers only missing full-precision KV pairs.

Result: Experiments on RULER and LongBench benchmarks with LLaMA-3-8B and Qwen2.5-7B show LRQK matches or surpasses leading sparse-attention methods in long context settings while delivering significant memory savings with minimal accuracy loss.

Conclusion: LRQK effectively addresses KV cache memory issues in LLMs by combining low-rank decomposition with efficient caching, enabling practical long-context inference while preserving exact attention outputs.

Abstract: As the length of input text grows, the key-value (KV) cache in LLMs imposes
prohibitive GPU memory costs and limits long-context inference on resource
constrained devices. Existing approaches, such as KV quantization and pruning,
reduce memory usage but suffer from numerical precision loss or suboptimal
retention of key-value pairs. We introduce Low Rank Query and Key attention
(LRQK), a two-stage framework that jointly decomposes the full-precision query
and key matrices into compact rank-\(r\) factors during the prefill stage, and
then uses these low-dimensional projections to compute proxy attention scores
in \(\mathcal{O}(lr)\) time at each decode step. By selecting only the
top-\(k\) tokens and a small fixed set of recent tokens, LRQK employs a mixed
GPU-CPU cache with a hit-and-miss mechanism that transfers only missing
full-precision KV pairs, thereby preserving exact attention outputs while
reducing CPU-GPU data movement. Extensive experiments on the RULER and
LongBench benchmarks with LLaMA-3-8B and Qwen2.5-7B demonstrate that LRQK
matches or surpasses leading sparse-attention methods in long context settings,
while delivering significant memory savings with minimal loss in accuracy. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have large model sizes and high computational costs that make deployment on resource-constrained edge devices challenging. Existing layer pruning methods rely on hand-crafted metrics and ignore layer dependencies, disrupting information flow and degrading performance.

Method: Proposes CLP with two innovations: 1) differentiable concave gate algorithm that automatically identifies optimal continuous layer segments for pruning via gradient-based optimization, 2) cutoff endpoint tuning strategy that fine-tunes only layers adjacent to pruned segments to restore performance.

Result: Extensive experiments on LLaMA2, LLaMA3 and Qwen models (7B to 70B parameters) show CLP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. At 20% pruning rate, CLP achieves 95.34% average performance retention on LLaMA3-70B, outperforming baselines by 4.29%-30.52%. Can be combined with quantization for further compression.

Conclusion: CLP effectively addresses limitations of existing layer pruning methods by considering layer dependencies and using gradient-based optimization, achieving superior performance retention while enabling practical deployment of LLMs on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have achieved revolutionary
breakthroughs in many fields, their large model size and high computational
cost pose significant challenges for practical deployment on
resource-constrained edge devices. To this end, layer pruning has been proposed
to reduce the computational overhead by directly removing redundant layers.
However, existing layer pruning methods typically rely on hand-crafted metrics
to evaluate and remove individual layers, while ignoring the dependencies
between layers. This can disrupt the model's information flow and severely
degrade performance. To address these issues, we propose CLP, a novel
continuous layer pruning framework that introduces two key innovations: a
differentiable concave gate algorithm that automatically identifies the best
continuous layer segments for pruning via gradient-based optimization; and a
cutoff endpoint tuning strategy that effectively restores model performance by
fine-tuning only the layers adjacent to the pruned segments. Extensive
experiments across multiple model architectures (including LLaMA2, LLaMA3 and
Qwen) and sizes (from $7$B to $70$B parameters) show that CLP significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines. For example, at a pruning rate
of $20\%$, CLP achieves an average performance retention of $95.34\%$ on
LLaMA3-70B, outperforming baselines by $4.29\%$-$30.52\%$. Furthermore, CLP can
be seamlessly combined with quantization to further compress the model with
only a slight performance loss.

### [96] [Error Adjustment Based on Spatiotemporal Correlation Fusion for Traffic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23656)
*Fuqiang Liu,Weiping Ding,Luis Miranda-Moreno,Lijun Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAEA is a framework that adjusts spatiotemporally autocorrelated prediction errors in traffic forecasting by modeling errors as a VAR process, using structural regularization and test-time adjustment to improve model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DNN-based traffic forecasting models assume uncorrelated errors, but traffic data has inherent spatiotemporal autocorrelation that limits model performance.

Method: Models errors as spatiotemporal VAR process, captures correlations via coefficient matrix with structural regularization, and implements test-time error adjustment.

Result: SAEA enhances performance across various traffic forecasting models and datasets in almost all cases.

Conclusion: The proposed SAEA framework effectively addresses spatiotemporal error autocorrelation in traffic forecasting and improves model performance.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) play a significant role in an increasing body of
research on traffic forecasting due to their effectively capturing
spatiotemporal patterns embedded in traffic data. A general assumption of
training the said forecasting models via mean squared error estimation is that
the errors across time steps and spatial positions are uncorrelated. However,
this assumption does not really hold because of the autocorrelation caused by
both the temporality and spatiality of traffic data. This gap limits the
performance of DNN-based forecasting models and is overlooked by current
studies. To fill up this gap, this paper proposes Spatiotemporally
Autocorrelated Error Adjustment (SAEA), a novel and general framework designed
to systematically adjust autocorrelated prediction errors in traffic
forecasting. Unlike existing approaches that assume prediction errors follow a
random Gaussian noise distribution, SAEA models these errors as a
spatiotemporal vector autoregressive (VAR) process to capture their intrinsic
dependencies. First, it explicitly captures both spatial and temporal error
correlations by a coefficient matrix, which is then embedded into a newly
formulated cost function. Second, a structurally sparse regularization is
introduced to incorporate prior spatial information, ensuring that the learned
coefficient matrix aligns with the inherent road network structure. Finally, an
inference process with test-time error adjustment is designed to dynamically
refine predictions, mitigating the impact of autocorrelated errors in real-time
forecasting. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified on
different traffic datasets. Results across a wide range of traffic forecasting
models show that our method enhances performance in almost all cases.

*Saklain Niam,Tashfiqur Rahman,Md. Amjad Patwary,Mukarram Hossain*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine learning framework using Extra Trees model successfully predicts cold plasma-induced seed germination uplift across multiple crop species with high accuracy (R²=0.925).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cold plasma is an eco-friendly seed treatment method, but its effects are difficult to predict due to complex seed-plasma-environment interactions, necessitating a predictive modeling approach.

Method: Used machine learning models (GB, XGB, ET, and hybrids) with dielectric barrier discharge plasma data on soybean, barley, sunflower, radish, and tomato seeds, with Extra Trees performing best.

Result: Extra Trees model achieved R²=0.919 (improved to 0.925 after feature reduction) with RMSE=3.21 and MAE=2.62. Identified hormetic response: optimal germination at 7-15 kV for 200-500s, reduced beyond 20 kV. Radish and soybean were most accurately predicted.

Conclusion: The ML framework provides a reliable decision-support tool for optimizing cold plasma seed germination treatments in precision agriculture, with species-specific prediction accuracy varying by cultivar.

Abstract: Cold plasma (CP) is an eco-friendly method to enhance seed germination, yet
outcomes remain difficult to predict due to complex seed--plasma--environment
interactions. This study introduces the first machine learning framework to
forecast germination uplift in soybean, barley, sunflower, radish, and tomato
under dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma. Among the models tested (GB,
XGB, ET, and hybrids), Extra Trees (ET) performed best (R\textsuperscript{2} =
0.919; RMSE = 3.21; MAE = 2.62), improving to R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.925
after feature reduction. Engineering analysis revealed a hormetic response:
negligible effects at $<$7 kV or $<$200 s, maximum germination at 7--15 kV for
200--500 s, and reduced germination beyond 20 kV or prolonged exposures.
Discharge power was also a dominant factor, with germination rate maximizing at
$\geq$100 W with low exposure time. Species and cultivar-level predictions
showed radish (MAE = 1.46) and soybean (MAE = 2.05) were modeled with high
consistency, while sunflower remained slightly higher variable (MAE = 3.80).
Among cultivars, Williams (MAE = 1.23) and Sari (1.33) were well predicted,
while Arian (2.86) and Ny\'{\i}rs\'{e}gi fekete (3.74) were comparatively
poorly captured. This framework was also embedded into MLflow, providing a
decision-support tool for optimizing CP seed germination in precision
agriculture.

TL;DR: ELBO-KTO combines ELBO surrogate for diffusion log-likelihoods with unpaired preference optimization (KTO) to align diffusion language models with human preferences without costly pairwise preference data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning diffusion language models with human preferences is challenging due to intractable sequence log-likelihoods and expensive pairwise preference data collection.

Method: Uses ELBO surrogate for diffusion log-likelihoods combined with Kahneman Tversky Optimization (KTO) for unpaired preference optimization, with variance-reduction techniques to stabilize training gradients.

Result: Achieved 65.9% and 62.3% adjusted win rates on kto-mix-14k and UltraFeedback-Binary datasets respectively, and performed on par or better than base model on GSM8K, MMLU, and other reasoning/knowledge benchmarks.

Conclusion: Establishes unpaired preference optimization as a viable alternative to pairwise alignment in diffusion LLMs.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (dLLMs) are an emerging alternative to
autoregressive (AR) generators, but aligning them to human preferences is
challenging because sequence log-likelihoods are intractable and pairwise
preference data are costly to collect. We introduce ELBO-KTO, which combines an
ELBO surrogate for diffusion log-likelihoods with a prospect-theoretic,
unpaired preference objective (Kahneman Tversky Optimization, KTO). We analyze
the bias and variance induced by the ELBO substitution and employ
variance-reduction practices that stabilize gradients during training. Applied
to LLaDA-8B-Instruct, ELBO-KTO yields \textbf{65.9\%} and \textbf{62.3\%}
adjusted win rates on kto-mix-14k and UltraFeedback-Binary, respectively,
versus the base model under an automatic LLM judge. Across downstream tasks,
including GSM8K, MMLU, and additional reasoning/knowledge benchmarks, ELBO-KTO
trained on UltraFeedback-Binary performs on par with or better than the base
model under identical decoding. This establishes unpaired preference
optimization as a viable alternative to pairwise alignment in diffusion LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical ML and deep learning struggle with high-dimensional complex datasets in image classification, requiring quantum computing to improve efficiency.

Method: Use ResNet-50 for feature extraction from potato disease images, apply PCA for dimensionality reduction, then process through QSVM with various quantum feature maps (ZZ, Z, Pauli-X).

Result: Z-feature map-based QSVM achieved 99.23% accuracy, outperforming classical SVM and Random Forest models.

Conclusion: Integration of quantum computing with classical deep learning provides superior performance for image classification and offers a promising solution for disease detection.

Abstract: Recently, there has been growing attention on combining quantum machine
learning (QML) with classical deep learning approaches, as computational
techniques are key to improving the performance of image classification tasks.
This study presents a hybrid approach that uses ResNet-50 (Residual Network)
for feature extraction and Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) for
classification in the context of potato disease detection. Classical machine
learning as well as deep learning models often struggle with high-dimensional
and complex datasets, necessitating advanced techniques like quantum computing
to improve classification efficiency. In our research, we use ResNet-50 to
extract deep feature representations from RGB images of potato diseases. These
features are then subjected to dimensionality reduction using Principal
Component Analysis (PCA). The resulting features are processed through QSVM
models which apply various quantum feature maps such as ZZ, Z, and Pauli-X to
transform classical data into quantum states. To assess the model performance,
we compared it with classical machine learning algorithms such as Support
Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) using five-fold stratified
cross-validation for comprehensive evaluation. The experimental results
demonstrate that the Z-feature map-based QSVM outperforms classical models,
achieving an accuracy of 99.23 percent, surpassing both SVM and RF models. This
research highlights the advantages of integrating quantum computing into image
classification and provides a potential disease detection solution through
hybrid quantum-classical modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A data-driven framework for learning health indicators in aerospace composites using two approaches: Diversity-DeepSAD (semi-supervised) and DTC-VAE (unsupervised), integrated with multi-domain signal processing and guided waves.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extracting reliable health indicators for aerospace composites is challenging due to material variability, stochastic damage evolution, diverse damage modes, and complications from manufacturing defects and in-service incidents.

Method: Two learning approaches: (1) Diversity-DeepSAD with continuous auxiliary labels as damage proxies, and (2) DTC-VAE with explicit monotonicity constraint. Uses guided waves with multiple frequencies, explores time/frequency/time-frequency representations, and fuses per-frequency HIs via unsupervised ensemble learning.

Result: Diversity-DeepSAD achieved 81.6% performance using FFT features, while DTC-VAE delivered the most consistent HIs with 92.3% performance, outperforming existing baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed data-driven framework successfully learns health indicators for aerospace composites, with DTC-VAE showing superior performance and consistency in handling the complex challenges of damage monitoring.

Abstract: Health indicators (HIs) are central to diagnosing and prognosing the
condition of aerospace composite structures, enabling efficient maintenance and
operational safety. However, extracting reliable HIs remains challenging due to
variability in material properties, stochastic damage evolution, and diverse
damage modes. Manufacturing defects (e.g., disbonds) and in-service incidents
(e.g., bird strikes) further complicate this process. This study presents a
comprehensive data-driven framework that learns HIs via two learning approaches
integrated with multi-domain signal processing. Because ground-truth HIs are
unavailable, a semi-supervised and an unsupervised approach are proposed: (i) a
diversity deep semi-supervised anomaly detection (Diversity-DeepSAD) approach
augmented with continuous auxiliary labels used as hypothetical damage proxies,
which overcomes the limitation of prior binary labels that only distinguish
healthy and failed states while neglecting intermediate degradation, and (ii) a
degradation-trend-constrained variational autoencoder (DTC-VAE), in which the
monotonicity criterion is embedded via an explicit trend constraint. Guided
waves with multiple excitation frequencies are used to monitor single-stiffener
composite structures under fatigue loading. Time, frequency, and time-frequency
representations are explored, and per-frequency HIs are fused via unsupervised
ensemble learning to mitigate frequency dependence and reduce variance. Using
fast Fourier transform features, the augmented Diversity-DeepSAD model achieved
81.6% performance, while DTC-VAE delivered the most consistent HIs with 92.3%
performance, outperforming existing baselines.

Motivation: To address limitations of classical CNNs in pneumonia detection, including high computational costs, limited feature representation, and poor generalization with small datasets, by leveraging quantum computing for enhanced feature extraction.

Method: A novel hybrid model with a quanvolutional layer using parameterized quantum circuits (PQC) to process 2x2 image patches, employing Y-gates for encoding and entangling layers for non-classical features, followed by classical neural network classification.

Result: The QNN achieved 83.33% validation accuracy compared to 73.33% for classical CNN, demonstrating enhanced convergence and sample efficiency, particularly beneficial for limited labeled data scenarios.

Conclusion: QNNs show significant potential for medical image analysis, offering computationally efficient alternatives to traditional approaches and laying foundation for quantum-enhanced medical diagnostic systems.

Abstract: Pneumonia poses a significant global health challenge, demanding accurate and
timely diagnosis. While deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs), has shown promise in medical image analysis for pneumonia
detection, CNNs often suffer from high computational costs, limitations in
feature representation, and challenges in generalizing from smaller datasets.
To address these limitations, we explore the application of Quanvolutional
Neural Networks (QNNs), leveraging quantum computing for enhanced feature
extraction. This paper introduces a novel hybrid quantum-classical model for
pneumonia detection using the PneumoniaMNIST dataset. Our approach utilizes a
quanvolutional layer with a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) to process 2x2
image patches, employing rotational Y-gates for data encoding and entangling
layers to generate non-classical feature representations. These
quantum-extracted features are then fed into a classical neural network for
classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed QNN achieves
a higher validation accuracy of 83.33 percent compared to a comparable
classical CNN which achieves 73.33 percent. This enhanced convergence and
sample efficiency highlight the potential of QNNs for medical image analysis,
particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. This research lays the
foundation for integrating quantum computing into deep-learning-driven medical
diagnostic systems, offering a computationally efficient alternative to
traditional approaches.

Conclusion: Transformer-based Earth observation enables scalable, transparent carbon accounting for agricultural emissions, supporting integration with national inventories and precision livestock platforms for policy-relevant mitigation assessment.

Abstract: Accurate mapping of column-averaged CO2 (XCO2) over agricultural landscapes
is essential for guiding emission mitigation strategies. We present a
Spatiotemporal Vision Transformer with Wavelets (ST-ViWT) framework that
reconstructs continuous, uncertainty-quantified XCO2 fields from OCO-2 across
southern Canada, emphasizing poultry-intensive regions. The model fuses wavelet
time-frequency representations with transformer attention over meteorology,
vegetation indices, topography, and land cover. On 2024 OCO-2 data, ST-ViWT
attains R2 = 0.984 and RMSE = 0.468 ppm; 92.3 percent of gap-filled predictions
lie within +/-1 ppm. Independent validation with TCCON shows robust
generalization (bias = -0.14 ppm; r = 0.928), including faithful reproduction
of the late-summer drawdown. Spatial analysis across 14 poultry regions reveals
a moderate positive association between facility density and XCO2 (r = 0.43);
high-density areas exhibit larger seasonal amplitudes (9.57 ppm) and enhanced
summer variability. Compared with conventional interpolation and standard
machine-learning baselines, ST-ViWT yields seamless 0.25 degree CO2 surfaces
with explicit uncertainties, enabling year-round coverage despite sparse
observations. The approach supports integration of satellite constraints with
national inventories and precision livestock platforms to benchmark emissions,
refine region-specific factors, and verify interventions. Importantly,
transformer-based Earth observation enables scalable, transparent, spatially
explicit carbon accounting, hotspot prioritization, and policy-relevant
mitigation assessment.

Motivation: Compressed file formats are efficient for storage and transmission but their potential for representation learning remains largely unexplored.

Method: Leverages inherent byte-stream structure of compressed files to design tokenization and encoding strategy, allowing standard transformers to learn directly from compressed data without raw byte processing or full media decoding.

Result: Substantially reduces token count for semantic classification, lowering computational complexity and memory usage while achieving competitive accuracy across diverse datasets, coding schemes, and modalities.

Conclusion: TEMPEST demonstrates that compressed data streams can be effectively used for representation learning, providing efficiency gains in memory and compute while maintaining competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Compressed file formats are the corner stone of efficient data storage and

TL;DR: A hybrid traffic flow forecasting framework using STL decomposition with LSTM, ARIMA, and XGBoost models achieves superior accuracy by specializing each model on different temporal components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single model approaches fail to capture complex, nonlinear, and multi-scale temporal patterns in traffic flow data, necessitating a more sophisticated forecasting method.

Method: STL decomposition separates traffic flow into trend, seasonal, and residual components, then LSTM models long-term trends, ARIMA captures seasonal periodicity, and XGBoost predicts nonlinear residual fluctuations, with multiplicative integration of predictions.

Result: The hybrid model significantly outperforms standalone LSTM, ARIMA, and XGBoost models across MAE, RMSE, and R-squared metrics using 998 NYC traffic flow records from 2015.

Conclusion: The decomposition strategy effectively isolates temporal characteristics, allowing model specialization that improves prediction accuracy, interpretability, and robustness in traffic flow forecasting.

Abstract: Accurate traffic flow forecasting is essential for intelligent transportation
systems and urban traffic management. However, single model approaches often
fail to capture the complex, nonlinear, and multi scale temporal patterns in
traffic flow data. This study proposes a decomposition driven hybrid framework
that integrates Seasonal Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) with three
complementary predictive models. STL first decomposes the original time series
into trend, seasonal, and residual components. Then, a Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM) network models long term trends, an Autoregressive Integrated Moving
Average (ARIMA) model captures seasonal periodicity, and an Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm predicts nonlinear residual fluctuations. The
final forecast is obtained through multiplicative integration of the sub model
predictions. Using 998 traffic flow records from a New York City intersection
between November and December 2015, results show that the LSTM ARIMA XGBoost
hybrid model significantly outperforms standalone models including LSTM, ARIMA,
and XGBoost across MAE, RMSE, and R squared metrics. The decomposition strategy
effectively isolates temporal characteristics, allowing each model to
specialize, thereby improving prediction accuracy, interpretability, and
robustness.

TL;DR: MoE models differ mechanistically from dense networks in how they use superposition. Network sparsity, not feature sparsity/importance, drives MoE behavior, with sparser networks showing greater monosemanticity and interpretable expert specialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanistic differences between Mixture of Experts (MoE) models and dense networks, particularly how superposition works differently in MoEs and what drives their behavior.

Method: Developed new metrics for measuring superposition across experts, analyzed how network sparsity affects MoE behavior, and proposed a new definition of expert specialization based on monosemantic feature representation.

Result: Found that network sparsity (active/total experts ratio) better characterizes MoEs than feature sparsity/importance. Models with greater network sparsity exhibit greater monosemanticity, and experts naturally organize around coherent feature combinations with proper initialization.

Conclusion: Network sparsity in MoEs may enable more interpretable models without sacrificing performance, challenging the assumption that interpretability and capability are fundamentally opposed.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have become central to scaling large language
models, yet their mechanistic differences from dense networks remain poorly
understood. Previous work has explored how dense models use
\textit{superposition} to represent more features than dimensions, and how
superposition is a function of feature sparsity and feature importance. MoE
models cannot be explained mechanistically through the same lens. We find that
neither feature sparsity nor feature importance cause discontinuous phase
changes, and that network sparsity (the ratio of active to total experts)
better characterizes MoEs. We develop new metrics for measuring superposition
across experts. Our findings demonstrate that models with greater network
sparsity exhibit greater \emph{monosemanticity}. We propose a new definition of
expert specialization based on monosemantic feature representation rather than
load balancing, showing that experts naturally organize around coherent feature
combinations when initialized appropriately. These results suggest that network
sparsity in MoEs may enable more interpretable models without sacrificing
performance, challenging the common assumption that interpretability and
capability are fundamentally at odds.

TL;DR: Proposes DBLoss, a decomposition-based loss function that separates time series into seasonal and trend components using exponential moving averages, then calculates weighted losses for each component to improve forecasting accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MSE loss functions often fail to capture seasonality and trend patterns effectively in time series forecasting, even when decomposition modules are used in models. This limitation affects forecasting accuracy across domains like economics, traffic, energy, and AIOps.

Method: DBLoss uses exponential moving averages to decompose time series into seasonal and trend components within the forecasting horizon. It calculates separate losses for each component and weights them. This loss function can be combined with any deep learning forecasting model.

Result: Extensive experiments show DBLoss significantly improves performance of state-of-the-art models across diverse real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness as a general loss function for time series forecasting.

Conclusion: DBLoss provides a new perspective on time series loss function design and effectively addresses the limitations of traditional MSE loss in capturing seasonal and trend patterns, making it a valuable contribution to time series forecasting.

Abstract: Time series forecasting holds significant value in various domains such as
economics, traffic, energy, and AIOps, as accurate predictions facilitate
informed decision-making. However, the existing Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss
function sometimes fails to accurately capture the seasonality or trend within
the forecasting horizon, even when decomposition modules are used in the
forward propagation to model the trend and seasonality separately. To address
these challenges, we propose a simple yet effective Decomposition-Based Loss
function called DBLoss. This method uses exponential moving averages to
decompose the time series into seasonal and trend components within the
forecasting horizon, and then calculates the loss for each of these components
separately, followed by weighting them. As a general loss function, DBLoss can
be combined with any deep learning forecasting model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DBLoss significantly improves the performance of
state-of-the-art models across diverse real-world datasets and provides a new
perspective on the design of time series loss functions.

Motivation: Standard (quasi-)random initialization designs neglect that space-filling may not reduce predictive uncertainty effectively and may conflict with efficient hyperparameter learning, which is crucial for surrogate model quality in few-shot Bayesian Optimization.

Method: Proposed Hyperparameter-Informed Predictive Exploration (HIPE) that uses information-theoretic principles to balance predictive uncertainty reduction with hyperparameter learning. Derived a closed-form expression for HIPE in the Gaussian Process setting.

Result: HIPE outperforms standard initialization strategies in predictive accuracy, hyperparameter identification, and subsequent optimization performance, especially in large-batch, few-shot settings relevant to real-world Bayesian Optimization applications.

Conclusion: HIPE provides an effective initialization strategy that addresses the limitations of traditional space-filling designs by jointly optimizing for predictive uncertainty reduction and hyperparameter learning in few-shot Bayesian Optimization.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization is a widely used method for optimizing expensive
black-box functions, relying on probabilistic surrogate models such as Gaussian
Processes. The quality of the surrogate model is crucial for good optimization
performance, especially in the few-shot setting where only a small number of
batches of points can be evaluated. In this setting, the initialization plays a
critical role in shaping the surrogate's predictive quality and guiding
subsequent optimization. Despite this, practitioners typically rely on
(quasi-)random designs to cover the input space. However, such approaches
neglect two key factors: (a) space-filling designs may not be desirable to
reduce predictive uncertainty, and (b) efficient hyperparameter learning during
initialization is essential for high-quality prediction, which may conflict
with space-filling designs. To address these limitations, we propose
Hyperparameter-Informed Predictive Exploration (HIPE), a novel acquisition
strategy that balances predictive uncertainty reduction with hyperparameter
learning using information-theoretic principles. We derive a closed-form
expression for HIPE in the Gaussian Process setting and demonstrate its
effectiveness through extensive experiments in active learning and few-shot BO.
Our results show that HIPE outperforms standard initialization strategies in
terms of predictive accuracy, hyperparameter identification, and subsequent
optimization performance, particularly in large-batch, few-shot settings
relevant to many real-world Bayesian Optimization applications.

### [109] [Beyond Prompt Engineering: Neuro-Symbolic-Causal Architecture for Robust Multi-Objective AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23682)
*Gokturk Aytug Akarlar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Chimera is a neuro-symbolic-causal architecture that combines LLM strategist, symbolic constraint engine, and causal inference to create robust autonomous agents, outperforming LLM-only and constrained-LLM baselines in e-commerce simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents exhibit catastrophic brittleness in high-stakes domains, with identical capabilities producing wildly different outcomes based solely on prompt framing, creating deployment risks.

Method: Chimera integrates three components: LLM strategist for decision-making, formally verified symbolic constraint engine for safety, and causal inference module for counterfactual reasoning. Tested in 52-week e-commerce simulations with price elasticity, trust dynamics, and seasonal demand.

Result: LLM-only agents failed catastrophically (total loss of $99K in volume scenarios, -48.6% brand trust in margin scenarios). Constrained-LLM achieved only 43-87% of Chimera's profit. Chimera delivered highest returns ($1.52M-$1.96M, up to +$2.2M) while improving brand trust (+1.8% to +10.8%, up to +20.86%). TLA+ verification showed zero constraint violations.

Conclusion: Architectural design, not prompt engineering, determines reliability of autonomous agents in production environments. Chimera demonstrates prompt-agnostic robustness through neuro-symbolic-causal integration.

Abstract: Large language models show promise as autonomous decision-making agents, yet
their deployment in high-stakes domains remains fraught with risk. Without
architectural safeguards, LLM agents exhibit catastrophic brittleness:
identical capabilities produce wildly different outcomes depending solely on
prompt framing. We present Chimera, a neuro-symbolic-causal architecture that
integrates three complementary components - an LLM strategist, a formally
verified symbolic constraint engine, and a causal inference module for
counterfactual reasoning. We benchmark Chimera against baseline architectures
(LLM-only, LLM with symbolic constraints) across 52-week simulations in a
realistic e-commerce environment featuring price elasticity, trust dynamics,
and seasonal demand. Under organizational biases toward either volume or margin
optimization, LLM-only agents fail catastrophically (total loss of \$99K in
volume scenarios) or destroy brand trust (-48.6% in margin scenarios). Adding
symbolic constraints prevents disasters but achieves only 43-87% of Chimera's
profit. Chimera consistently delivers the highest returns (\$1.52M and \$1.96M
respectively, some cases +\$2.2M) while improving brand trust (+1.8% and
+10.8%, some cases +20.86%), demonstrating prompt-agnostic robustness. Our TLA+
formal verification proves zero constraint violations across all scenarios.
These results establish that architectural design not prompt engineering
determines the reliability of autonomous agents in production environments. We
provide open-source implementations and interactive demonstrations for
reproducibility.

*Junwen Ma,Mingyu Ge,Yisen Wang,Yong Zhang,Weicheng Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid Transformer-BiLSTM model for chaotic time series prediction that captures both long-range dependencies and local features through parallel branches with feature fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chaotic systems are highly sensitive to initial conditions and conventional methods fail to capture both local features and global dependencies simultaneously.

Method: Parallel predictive framework with dual-branch architecture: Transformer for long-range dependencies and BiLSTM for local temporal features, with feature fusion layer.

Result: Outperforms single-branch architectures on Lorenz system tasks (autonomous evolution prediction and unmeasured variable inference), demonstrating robustness and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework successfully addresses the limitations of conventional approaches for chaotic system prediction by combining complementary representations from different network architectures.

Abstract: The nonlinear nature of chaotic systems results in extreme sensitivity to
initial conditions and highly intricate dynamical behaviors, posing fundamental
challenges for accurately predicting their evolution. To overcome the
limitation that conventional approaches fail to capture both local features and
global dependencies in chaotic time series simultaneously, this study proposes
a parallel predictive framework integrating Transformer and Bidirectional Long
Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks. The hybrid model employs a dual-branch
architecture, where the Transformer branch mainly captures long-range
dependencies while the BiLSTM branch focuses on extracting local temporal
features. The complementary representations from the two branches are fused in
a dedicated feature-fusion layer to enhance predictive accuracy. As
illustrating examples, the model's performance is systematically evaluated on
two representative tasks in the Lorenz system. The first is autonomous
evolution prediction, in which the model recursively extrapolates system
trajectories from the time-delay embeddings of the state vector to evaluate
long-term tracking accuracy and stability. The second is inference of
unmeasured variable, where the model reconstructs the unobserved states from
the time-delay embeddings of partial observations to assess its
state-completion capability. The results consistently indicate that the
proposed hybrid framework outperforms both single-branch architectures across
tasks, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in chaotic system
prediction.

*Anisha Saha,Varsha Suresh,Timothy Hospedales,Vera Demberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MUStReason is a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating VideoLMs' sarcasm detection capabilities, featuring modality-specific cue annotations and reasoning steps. The paper also introduces PragCoT, a framework that helps VideoLMs focus on implied intentions rather than literal meaning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal models struggle with complex tasks like sarcasm detection, which requires identifying relevant cues across modalities and pragmatic reasoning to infer speaker's intention. VideoLMs have limitations in handling these nuanced tasks.

Method: Created MUStReason benchmark with annotations of modality-specific cues and reasoning steps. Proposed PragCoT framework that disentangles perception and reasoning, steering VideoLMs to focus on implied intentions over literal meaning.

Result: The benchmark enables quantitative and qualitative evaluation of sarcasm classification performance and generated reasoning in VideoLMs. PragCoT improves the models' ability to detect sarcasm by emphasizing pragmatic reasoning.

Conclusion: MUStReason provides a comprehensive diagnostic tool for evaluating VideoLMs' sarcasm detection capabilities, while PragCoT offers an effective framework to enhance their performance by focusing on implied intentions rather than literal content.

Abstract: Sarcasm is a specific type of irony which involves discerning what is said
from what is meant. Detecting sarcasm depends not only on the literal content
of an utterance but also on non-verbal cues such as speaker's tonality, facial
expressions and conversational context. However, current multimodal models
struggle with complex tasks like sarcasm detection, which require identifying
relevant cues across modalities and pragmatically reasoning over them to infer
the speaker's intention. To explore these limitations in VideoLMs, we introduce
MUStReason, a diagnostic benchmark enriched with annotations of
modality-specific relevant cues and underlying reasoning steps to identify
sarcastic intent. In addition to benchmarking sarcasm classification
performance in VideoLMs, using MUStReason we quantitatively and qualitatively
evaluate the generated reasoning by disentangling the problem into perception
and reasoning, we propose PragCoT, a framework that steers VideoLMs to focus on
implied intentions over literal meaning, a property core to detecting sarcasm.

*Ignavier Ng,Patrick Blöbaum,Siddharth Bhandari,Kun Zhang,Shiva Kasiviswanathan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a principled framework to mitigate spurious correlations in reward models while preserving genuine human preferences, using variational inference to identify and leverage non-spurious latent variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current alignment techniques like RLHF often exploit spurious correlations (response length, discrimination, sycophancy, conceptual bias) in reward models, which is a growing problem that needs addressing.

Method: Formulates data-generating process with spurious and non-spurious latent variables, shows non-spurious variables can be theoretically identified, and uses variational inference to recover these variables for training reward models.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show the method effectively mitigates spurious correlation issues and yields more robust reward models.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses spurious correlation problems in reward models while maintaining intended human preferences, demonstrating practical effectiveness across different datasets.

Abstract: Recent alignment techniques, such as reinforcement learning from human
feedback, have been widely adopted to align large language models with human
preferences by learning and leveraging reward models. In practice, these models
often exploit spurious correlations, involving, e.g., response length,
discrimination, sycophancy, and conceptual bias, which is a problem that has
received increasing attention. In this work, we propose a principled framework
that mitigates these biases in reward models while preserving the underlying
factors that reflect intended preferences. We first provide a formulation of
the data-generating process, assuming that the observed data (e.g., text) is
generated from both spurious and non-spurious latent variables. We show that,
interestingly, these non-spurious latent variables can be theoretically
identified from data, regardless of whether a surrogate for the spurious latent
variables is available. This further inspires a practical method that uses
variational inference to recover these variables and leverages them to train
reward models. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that our method effectively mitigates spurious correlation issues and yields
more robust reward models.

TL;DR: Cobweb/4V, a hierarchical concept formation model, shows robustness to catastrophic forgetting in continual learning. Three hypotheses are tested: adaptive structural reorganization enhances retention, sparse updates reduce interference, and information-theoretic learning outperforms gradient-based backpropagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the factors contributing to Cobweb/4V's robustness against catastrophic forgetting in continual learning and compare it with neural baselines.

Method: Compare Cobweb/4V with neural baselines (including CobwebNN) on datasets of varying complexity (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, MedMNIST, CIFAR-10) to test three hypotheses about adaptive restructuring, sparse updates, and information-theoretic learning.

Result: Experiments show that adaptive restructuring enhances learning plasticity, sparse updates mitigate interference, and information-theoretic learning preserves prior knowledge without revisiting past data.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights into mechanisms that mitigate catastrophic forgetting and highlight the potential of concept-based, information-theoretic approaches for building stable and adaptive continual learning systems.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a central challenge in continual learning,
where models are required to integrate new knowledge over time without losing
what they have previously learned. In prior work, we introduced Cobweb/4V, a
hierarchical concept formation model that exhibited robustness to catastrophic
forgetting in visual domains. Motivated by this robustness, we examine three
hypotheses regarding the factors that contribute to such stability: (1)
adaptive structural reorganization enhances knowledge retention, (2) sparse and
selective updates reduce interference, and (3) information-theoretic learning
based on sufficiency statistics provides advantages over gradient-based
backpropagation. To test these hypotheses, we compare Cobweb/4V with neural
baselines, including CobwebNN, a neural implementation of the Cobweb framework
introduced in this work. Experiments on datasets of varying complexity (MNIST,
Fashion-MNIST, MedMNIST, and CIFAR-10) show that adaptive restructuring
enhances learning plasticity, sparse updates help mitigate interference, and
the information-theoretic learning process preserves prior knowledge without
revisiting past data. Together, these findings provide insight into mechanisms
that can mitigate catastrophic forgetting and highlight the potential of
concept-based, information-theoretic approaches for building stable and
adaptive continual learning systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RSS is a new MCMC framework for protein design that combines AlphaFold2 structural objectives with ESM2 sequence priors, achieving 5x more designable structures and 2-3x greater diversity than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing protein design methods like RSO rely on single-path gradient descent and ignore sequence-space constraints, limiting diversity and designability.

Method: Relaxed Sequence Sampling (RSS) uses Markov chain Monte Carlo in continuous logit space, combining gradient-guided exploration with protein language model-informed jumps, and couples AlphaFold2 structural objectives with ESM2 sequence priors.

Result: In protein binder design, RSS produces 5x more designable structures and 2-3x greater structural diversity than RSO baselines at equal computational cost.

Conclusion: RSS provides a principled approach for efficiently exploring the protein design landscape by integrating structural and evolutionary information.

Abstract: Protein design using structure prediction models such as AlphaFold2 has shown
remarkable success, but existing approaches like relaxed sequence optimization
(RSO) rely on single-path gradient descent and ignore sequence-space
constraints, limiting diversity and designability. We introduce Relaxed
Sequence Sampling (RSS), a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework that
integrates structural and evolutionary information for protein design. RSS
operates in continuous logit space, combining gradient-guided exploration with
protein language model-informed jumps. Its energy function couples
AlphaFold2-derived structural objectives with ESM2-derived sequence priors,
balancing accuracy and biological plausibility. In an in silico protein binder
design task, RSS produces 5$\times$ more designable structures and 2-3$\times$
greater structural diversity than RSO baselines, at equal computational cost.
These results highlight RSS as a principled approach for efficiently exploring
the protein design landscape.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FuXi-ENS, an AI-based ensemble forecasting system with learnable perturbations, outperforms ECMWF-ENS in tropical cyclone track forecasting and better captures large-scale circulation patterns, though it underestimates intensity compared to observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ensemble forecasting systems for tropical cyclones are constrained by high computational costs and limited capability to fully represent atmospheric nonlinearity, creating a need for more efficient and effective AI-based approaches.

Method: FuXi-ENS introduces a learnable perturbation scheme for ensemble generation, representing a novel AI-based forecasting paradigm. The system was systematically compared with ECMWF-ENS using all 90 global tropical cyclones in 2018.

Result: FuXi-ENS demonstrates advantages in predicting TC-related physical variables, achieves more accurate track forecasts with reduced ensemble spread, and better captures large-scale circulation. However, it underestimates intensity relative to observations.

Conclusion: Learnable perturbations show potential to improve tropical cyclone forecasting skill and provide valuable insights for advancing AI-based ensemble prediction of extreme weather events with significant societal impacts.

Abstract: Tropical cyclones (TCs) are highly destructive and inherently uncertain
weather systems. Ensemble forecasting helps quantify these uncertainties, yet
traditional systems are constrained by high computational costs and limited
capability to fully represent atmospheric nonlinearity. FuXi-ENS introduces a
learnable perturbation scheme for ensemble generation, representing a novel
AI-based forecasting paradigm. Here, we systematically compare FuXi-ENS with
ECMWF-ENS using all 90 global TCs in 2018, examining their performance in
TC-related physical variables, track and intensity forecasts, and the
associated dynamical and thermodynamical fields. FuXi-ENS demonstrates clear
advantages in predicting TC-related physical variables, and achieves more
accurate track forecasts with reduced ensemble spread, though it still
underestimates intensity relative to observations. Further dynamical and
thermodynamical analyses reveal that FuXi-ENS better captures large-scale
circulation, with moisture turbulent energy more tightly concentrated around
the TC warm core, whereas ECMWF-ENS exhibits a more dispersed distribution.
These findings highlight the potential of learnable perturbations to improve TC
forecasting skill and provide valuable insights for advancing AI-based ensemble
prediction of extreme weather events that have significant societal impacts.

*Nathan Paek,Yongyi Zang,Qihui Yang,Randal Leistikow*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for interpreting audio generative models by mapping latent representations to human-interpretable acoustic concepts using sparse autoencoders and linear mappings to acoustic properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse autoencoders work well for language models but face challenges in audio generation due to audio's dense nature and limited automatic feature characterization, requiring better interpretability methods.

Method: Train SAEs on audio autoencoder latents, then learn linear mappings from SAE features to discretized acoustic properties (pitch, amplitude, timbre) for controllable manipulation and analysis.

Result: Validated on continuous (DiffRhythm-VAE) and discrete (EnCodec, WavTokenizer) audio latent spaces, analyzing DiffRhythm model to show how pitch, timbre, and loudness evolve during generation.

Conclusion: The framework enables interpretable analysis of audio generation and can be extended to visual latent space generation models.

Abstract: While sparse autoencoders (SAEs) successfully extract interpretable features
from language models, applying them to audio generation faces unique
challenges: audio's dense nature requires compression that obscures semantic
meaning, and automatic feature characterization remains limited. We propose a
framework for interpreting audio generative models by mapping their latent
representations to human-interpretable acoustic concepts. We train SAEs on
audio autoencoder latents, then learn linear mappings from SAE features to
discretized acoustic properties (pitch, amplitude, and timbre). This enables
both controllable manipulation and analysis of the AI music generation process,
revealing how acoustic properties emerge during synthesis. We validate our
approach on continuous (DiffRhythm-VAE) and discrete (EnCodec, WavTokenizer)
audio latent spaces, and analyze DiffRhythm, a state-of-the-art text-to-music
model, to demonstrate how pitch, timbre, and loudness evolve throughout
generation. While our work is only done on audio modality, our framework can be
extended to interpretable analysis of visual latent space generation models.

*Adela DePavia,Vasileios Charisopoulos,Rebecca Willett*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adam's richness bias for nonlinear decision boundaries is sensitive to data rotations, which can reverse its advantage over gradient descent. A reparameterization method restores Adam's bias by making it equivariant to rotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why adaptive gradient methods like Adam affect generalization differently from gradient descent, particularly their sensitivity to data transformations and how to mitigate this issue.

Method: Analyze Adam's coordinate-wise preconditioning sensitivity to orthogonal transformations, and apply a reparameterization method that uses orthogonal transformations to make first-order methods rotation-equivariant.

Result: Small data rotations can make Adam lose its richness bias and converge to worse linear boundaries than gradient descent. The reparameterization method successfully restores Adam's bias towards rich decision boundaries.

Conclusion: Adam's generalization performance is highly sensitive to data rotations due to its coordinate-wise nature, but this can be mitigated through appropriate reparameterization to achieve rotation-equivariant optimization.

Abstract: Adaptive gradient methods such as Adam and Adagrad are widely used in machine
learning, yet their effect on the generalization of learned models -- relative
to methods like gradient descent -- remains poorly understood. Prior work on
binary classification suggests that Adam exhibits a ``richness bias,'' which
can help it learn nonlinear decision boundaries closer to the Bayes-optimal
decision boundary relative to gradient descent. However, the coordinate-wise
preconditioning scheme employed by Adam renders the overall method sensitive to
orthogonal transformations of feature space. We show that this sensitivity can
manifest as a reversal of Adam's competitive advantage: even small rotations of
the underlying data distribution can make Adam forfeit its richness bias and
converge to a linear decision boundary that is farther from the Bayes-optimal
decision boundary than the one learned by gradient descent. To alleviate this
issue, we show that a recently proposed reparameterization method -- which
applies an orthogonal transformation to the optimization objective -- endows
any first-order method with equivariance to data rotations, and we empirically
demonstrate its ability to restore Adam's bias towards rich decision
boundaries.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A physics-informed operator learning method that extends RINO to work without training data, handling unevenly discretized multi-resolution inputs by projecting them to a latent space and using MLP with PDE enforcement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Operator learning frameworks require large amounts of high-fidelity training data which is challenging to obtain, and real-world datasets often have uneven discretization with varying grid resolutions across samples.

Method: Extends RINO framework to data-free setup by projecting arbitrarily discretized inputs to latent embedding space using pre-trained basis functions, then uses MLP that takes latent codes and spatiotemporal coordinates to produce solutions, with PDEs enforced via finite difference solver.

Result: Method validated on numerical examples with multi-resolution data where input functions are sampled at varying resolutions including both coarse and fine discretizations.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses both data scarcity and uneven discretization challenges in operator learning for engineering applications.

Abstract: The predictive accuracy of operator learning frameworks depends on the
quality and quantity of available training data (input-output function pairs),
often requiring substantial amounts of high-fidelity data, which can be
challenging to obtain in some real-world engineering applications. These
datasets may be unevenly discretized from one realization to another, with the
grid resolution varying across samples. In this study, we introduce a
physics-informed operator learning approach by extending the Resolution
Independent Neural Operator (RINO) framework to a fully data-free setup,
addressing both challenges simultaneously. Here, the arbitrarily (but
sufficiently finely) discretized input functions are projected onto a latent
embedding space (i.e., a vector space of finite dimensions), using pre-trained
basis functions. The operator associated with the underlying partial
differential equations (PDEs) is then approximated by a simple multi-layer
perceptron (MLP), which takes as input a latent code along with spatiotemporal
coordinates to produce the solution in the physical space. The PDEs are
enforced via a finite difference solver in the physical space. The validation
and performance of the proposed method are benchmarked on several numerical
examples with multi-resolution data, where input functions are sampled at
varying resolutions, including both coarse and fine discretizations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial processes generate complex data that challenge fault detection systems, yielding opaque or underwhelming results despite advanced machine learning techniques.

Method: Uses SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to identify critical process features, then applies causal analysis through Directed Acyclic Graphs generated by multiple algorithms to uncover fault propagation mechanisms.

Result: The causal structures align with SHAP findings, consistently highlighting key process elements like cooling and separation systems as pivotal to fault development, enhancing detection accuracy and providing actionable insights.

Conclusion: This dual approach bridges predictive power with causal understanding, offering a robust tool for monitoring complex manufacturing environments and enabling smarter, more interpretable fault detection.

Abstract: Industrial processes generate complex data that challenge fault detection
systems, often yielding opaque or underwhelming results despite advanced
machine learning techniques. This study tackles such difficulties using the
Tennessee Eastman Process, a well-established benchmark known for its intricate
dynamics, to develop an innovative fault detection framework. Initial attempts
with standard models revealed limitations in both performance and
interpretability, prompting a shift toward a more tractable approach. By
employing SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), we transform the problem into a
more manageable and transparent form, pinpointing the most critical process
features driving fault predictions. This reduction in complexity unlocks the
ability to apply causal analysis through Directed Acyclic Graphs, generated by
multiple algorithms, to uncover the underlying mechanisms of fault propagation.
The resulting causal structures align strikingly with SHAP findings,
consistently highlighting key process elements-like cooling and separation
systems-as pivotal to fault development. Together, these methods not only
enhance detection accuracy but also provide operators with clear, actionable
insights into fault origins, a synergy that, to our knowledge, has not been
previously explored in this context. This dual approach bridges predictive
power with causal understanding, offering a robust tool for monitoring complex
manufacturing environments and paving the way for smarter, more interpretable
fault detection in industrial systems.

*Yilang Zhang,Xiaodong Yang,Yiwei Cai,Georgios B. Giannakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel method called High-Rank LoRA (Hi-LoRA) that accumulates low-rank increments to form high-rank weight updates, improving performance and convergence speed over standard LoRA while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of standard LoRA where low-rank restrictions can hinder effectiveness and slow convergence in large language model fine-tuning.

Method: Progressively accumulates high-rank weight updates from consecutive low-rank increments by identifying optimal low-rank matrices that minimize loss and approximate full fine-tuning, using analytical scaling of original low-rank matrix columns.

Result: Extensive tests on LLMs up to 12B parameters show consistent performance gains and fast convergence on natural language understanding, commonsense reasoning, and mathematical problem solving tasks compared to state-of-the-art LoRA variants.

Conclusion: The proposed Hi-LoRA method effectively overcomes LoRA's limitations by building high-rank updates from low-rank increments, achieving better performance and faster convergence while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale in size, the computational
overhead has become a major bottleneck for task-specific fine-tuning. While
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) effectively curtails this cost by confining the
weight updates to a low-dimensional subspace, such a restriction can hinder
effectiveness and slow convergence. This contribution deals with these
limitations by accumulating progressively a high-rank weight update from
consecutive low-rank increments. Specifically, the per update optimal low-rank
matrix is identified to minimize the loss function and closely approximate full
fine-tuning. To endow efficient and seamless optimization without restarting,
this optimal choice is formed by appropriately scaling the columns of the
original low-rank matrix. Rigorous performance guarantees reveal that the
optimal scaling can be found analytically. Extensive numerical tests with
popular LLMs scaling up to 12 billion parameters demonstrate a consistent
performance gain and fast convergence relative to state-of-the-art LoRA
variants on diverse tasks including natural language understanding, commonsense
reasoning, and mathematical problem solving.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes integrating response time data with binary preference data using the EZ model to improve reward model learning, achieving better theoretical convergence rates and sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current preference learning frameworks only use binary choice data, ignoring valuable temporal information from user decision-making that could reveal preference strength.

Method: Developed Neyman-orthogonal loss functions incorporating response time information using the Evidence Accumulation Drift Diffusion (EZ) model, with extensions to both linear and non-parametric reward functions.

Result: The response time-augmented approach reduces error rates from exponential to polynomial scaling with reward magnitude, achieving oracle convergence rates matching theoretical optimal performance.

Conclusion: Incorporating response time data significantly improves reward model learning efficiency and performance, with theoretical guarantees and experimental validation in image preference learning.

Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of response time data into human
preference learning frameworks for more effective reward model elicitation.
While binary preference data has become fundamental in fine-tuning foundation
models, generative AI systems, and other large-scale models, the valuable
temporal information inherent in user decision-making remains largely
unexploited. We propose novel methodologies to incorporate response time
information alongside binary choice data, leveraging the Evidence Accumulation
Drift Diffusion (EZ) model, under which response time is informative of the
preference strength. We develop Neyman-orthogonal loss functions that achieve
oracle convergence rates for reward model learning, matching the theoretical
optimal rates that would be attained if the expected response times for each
query were known a priori. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that for
linear reward functions, conventional preference learning suffers from error
rates that scale exponentially with reward magnitude. In contrast, our response
time-augmented approach reduces this to polynomial scaling, representing a
significant improvement in sample efficiency. We extend these guarantees to
non-parametric reward function spaces, establishing convergence properties for
more complex, realistic reward models. Our extensive experiments validate our
theoretical findings in the context of preference learning over images.

TL;DR: A physics-conditioned latent diffusion model for dynamical downscaling of atmospheric data, specifically for reconstructing high-resolution 2-m temperature fields, with PDE loss integration for physical consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the physical plausibility of generated atmospheric fields by enforcing physical consistency through PDE-based regularization in diffusion models.

Method: Built on pre-existing diffusion architecture using residual formulation against reference UNet, integrated PDE loss term computed in full resolution space via latent decoding, using finite-difference approximation of effective advection-diffusion balance.

Result: Conventional diffusion training already yields low PDE residuals, and fine-tuning with additional PDE loss further regularizes the model and enhances physical plausibility of generated fields.

Conclusion: The physics-conditioned latent diffusion model successfully integrates physical constraints through PDE loss, improving physical consistency in atmospheric data downscaling, with codebase publicly available for future development.

Abstract: This work presents a physics-conditioned latent diffusion model tailored for
dynamical downscaling of atmospheric data, with a focus on reconstructing
high-resolution 2-m temperature fields. Building upon a pre-existing diffusion
architecture and employing a residual formulation against a reference UNet, we
integrate a partial differential equation (PDE) loss term into the model's
training objective. The PDE loss is computed in the full resolution (pixel)
space by decoding the latent representation and is designed to enforce physical
consistency through a finite-difference approximation of an effective
advection-diffusion balance. Empirical observations indicate that conventional
diffusion training already yields low PDE residuals, and we investigate how
fine-tuning with this additional loss further regularizes the model and
enhances the physical plausibility of the generated fields. The entirety of our
codebase is available on Github, for future reference and development.

### [124] [GIFT: Group-relative Implicit Fine Tuning Integrates GRPO with DPO and UNA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23868)
*Zhichao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GIFT is a novel RL framework for LLM alignment that minimizes discrepancy between implicit and explicit reward models through joint normalization, transforming reward maximization into a convex MSE optimization problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of existing methods like PPO, GRPO, DPO and UNA by creating a more stable, efficient alignment approach that retains exploration capability while reducing hyperparameters and training overfitting.

Method: Combines GRPO's multi-response generation with DPO's implicit rewards and UNA's implicit-explicit alignment principle. Uses joint normalization of implicit and explicit rewards to eliminate intractable terms, converting the problem into a convex MSE loss formulation.

Result: Achieves superior reasoning and alignment performance on mathematical benchmarks with faster convergence, better generalization, reduced training overfitting, and computational efficiency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: GIFT provides an effective on-policy alignment framework that balances stability, efficiency, and exploration while outperforming existing approaches in both reasoning performance and training characteristics.

Abstract: I propose \textbf{G}roup-relative \textbf{I}mplicit \textbf{F}ine
\textbf{T}uning (GIFT), a novel reinforcement learning framework for aligning
LLMs. Instead of directly maximizing cumulative rewards like PPO or GRPO, GIFT
minimizes the discrepancy between implicit and explicit reward models. It
combines three key ideas: (1) the online multi-response generation and
normalization of GRPO, (2) the implicit reward formulation of DPO, and (3) the
implicit-explicit reward alignment principle of UNA. By jointly normalizing the
implicit and explicit rewards, GIFT eliminates an otherwise intractable term
that prevents effective use of implicit rewards. This normalization transforms
the complex reward maximization objective into a simple mean squared error
(MSE) loss between the normalized reward functions, converting a non-convex
optimization problem into a convex, stable, and analytically differentiable
formulation. Unlike offline methods such as DPO and UNA, GIFT remains on-policy
and thus retains exploration capability. Compared to GRPO, it requires fewer
hyperparameters, converges faster, and generalizes better with significantly
reduced training overfitting. Empirically, GIFT achieves superior reasoning and
alignment performance on mathematical benchmarks while remaining
computationally efficient.

### [125] [Artificial Intelligence Based Predictive Maintenance for Electric Buses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23879)
*Ayse Irmak Ercevik,Ahmet Murat Ozbayoglu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A graph-based feature selection method combined with machine learning effectively predicts vehicle alarms in electric buses using CAN Bus data, enabling proactive maintenance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Electric buses pose challenges for predictive maintenance due to complex electric systems, and traditional scheduled maintenance struggles to capture anomalies in real-time CAN Bus data.

Method: Developed hybrid graph-based feature selection combining statistical filtering (Pearson correlation, Cramer's V, ANOVA F-test) with community detection algorithms. Used ML models (SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost) optimized via grid/random search with SMOTEEN and down-sampling. Applied LIME for interpretability.

Result: The system effectively predicts vehicle alarms, enhances feature interpretability, and supports proactive maintenance strategies.

Conclusion: The developed approach successfully addresses predictive maintenance challenges for electric buses and aligns with Industry 4.0 principles.

Abstract: Predictive maintenance (PdM) is crucial for optimizing efficiency and
minimizing downtime of electric buses. While these vehicles provide
environmental benefits, they pose challenges for PdM due to complex electric
transmission and battery systems. Traditional maintenance, often based on
scheduled inspections, struggles to capture anomalies in multi-dimensional
real-time CAN Bus data. This study employs a graph-based feature selection
method to analyze relationships among CAN Bus parameters of electric buses and
investigates the prediction performance of targeted alarms using artificial
intelligence techniques. The raw data collected over two years underwent
extensive preprocessing to ensure data quality and consistency. A hybrid
graph-based feature selection tool was developed by combining statistical
filtering (Pearson correlation, Cramer's V, ANOVA F-test) with
optimization-based community detection algorithms (InfoMap, Leiden, Louvain,
Fast Greedy). Machine learning models, including SVM, Random Forest, and
XGBoost, were optimized through grid and random search with data balancing via
SMOTEEN and binary search-based down-sampling. Model interpretability was
achieved using LIME to identify the features influencing predictions. The
results demonstrate that the developed system effectively predicts vehicle
alarms, enhances feature interpretability, and supports proactive maintenance
strategies aligned with Industry 4.0 principles.

### [126] [RS-ORT: A Reduced-Space Branch-and-Bound Algorithm for Optimal Regression Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23901)
*Cristobal Heredia,Pedro Chumpitaz-Flores,Kaixun Hua*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RS-ORT is a specialized branch-and-bound algorithm that trains optimal regression trees by branching only on tree-structural variables, enabling efficient handling of large-scale datasets with continuous features while guaranteeing convergence and better performance than state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MIP approaches for regression trees are limited to binary features or become intractable with continuous, large-scale data. Naive binarization sacrifices optimality and yields deep trees.

Method: Two-stage optimization with branch-and-bound algorithm that branches exclusively on tree-structural variables, using bound tightening techniques (closed-form leaf prediction, empirical threshold discretization, depth-1 subtree parsing) and decomposable bounding strategies.

Result: Superior training and testing performance on regression benchmarks, handles datasets up to 2,000,000 samples with continuous features, obtains guaranteed training performance with simpler tree structure and better generalization in four hours.

Conclusion: RS-ORT effectively addresses computational intractability in optimal regression tree training for large-scale continuous data, delivering optimal trees with better generalization through specialized branch-and-bound design and parallel execution capabilities.

Abstract: Mixed-integer programming (MIP) has emerged as a powerful framework for
learning optimal decision trees. Yet, existing MIP approaches for regression
tasks are either limited to purely binary features or become computationally
intractable when continuous, large-scale data are involved. Naively binarizing
continuous features sacrifices global optimality and often yields needlessly
deep trees. We recast the optimal regression-tree training as a two-stage
optimization problem and propose Reduced-Space Optimal Regression Trees
(RS-ORT) - a specialized branch-and-bound (BB) algorithm that branches
exclusively on tree-structural variables. This design guarantees the
algorithm's convergence and its independence from the number of training
samples. Leveraging the model's structure, we introduce several bound
tightening techniques - closed-form leaf prediction, empirical threshold
discretization, and exact depth-1 subtree parsing - that combine with
decomposable upper and lower bounding strategies to accelerate the training.
The BB node-wise decomposition enables trivial parallel execution, further
alleviating the computational intractability even for million-size datasets.
Based on the empirical studies on several regression benchmarks containing both
binary and continuous features, RS-ORT also delivers superior training and
testing performance than state-of-the-art methods. Notably, on datasets with up
to 2,000,000 samples with continuous features, RS-ORT can obtain guaranteed
training performance with a simpler tree structure and a better generalization
ability in four hours.

*Wasim Ahmad,Maha Shadaydeh,Joachim Denzler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: gCDMI is a novel multi-group causal discovery method that uses group-level interventions on trained deep neural networks and model invariance testing to identify causal relationships between groups of variables in nonlinear multivariate time series.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing causal discovery methods focus only on pairwise cause-effect relationships and overlook interactions among groups of variables (subsystems) and their collective causal influence.

Method: Three-step approach: 1) Use deep learning to jointly model structural relationships among groups of time series, 2) Apply group-wise interventions to the trained model, 3) Conduct model invariance testing to determine causal links among variable groups.

Result: Superior performance in identifying group-level causal relationships compared to existing methods on simulated datasets. Validated on real-world datasets including brain networks and climate ecosystems.

Conclusion: Group-level interventions on deep learning models combined with invariance testing can effectively reveal complex causal structures, providing valuable insights for neuroscience and climate science.

Abstract: Causal discovery uncovers complex relationships between variables, enhancing
predictions, decision-making, and insights into real-world systems, especially
in nonlinear multivariate time series. However, most existing methods primarily
focus on pairwise cause-effect relationships, overlooking interactions among
groups of variables, i.e., subsystems and their collective causal influence. In
this study, we introduce gCDMI, a novel multi-group causal discovery method
that leverages group-level interventions on trained deep neural networks and
employs model invariance testing to infer causal relationships. Our approach
involves three key steps. First, we use deep learning to jointly model the
structural relationships among groups of all time series. Second, we apply
group-wise interventions to the trained model. Finally, we conduct model
invariance testing to determine the presence of causal links among variable
groups. We evaluate our method on simulated datasets, demonstrating its
superior performance in identifying group-level causal relationships compared
to existing methods. Additionally, we validate our approach on real-world
datasets, including brain networks and climate ecosystems. Our results
highlight that applying group-level interventions to deep learning models,
combined with invariance testing, can effectively reveal complex causal
structures, offering valuable insights for domains such as neuroscience and
climate science.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proves Query weights in attention mechanisms are redundant, reducing parameters by over 8% while maintaining comparable performance in GPT-3 small architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether the Query, Key, Value weight triplet in attention mechanisms can be reduced to optimize LLM parameter efficiency.

Method: Theoretical analysis under simplifying assumptions followed by empirical validation on full-complexity GPT-3 small architectures with layer normalization, skip connections, and weight decay trained from scratch.

Result: Reduced model without Query weights achieves comparable validation loss to standard baselines while reducing non-embedding/lm-head parameters by over 8%.

Conclusion: Query weight redundancy exists in attention mechanisms, motivating further investigation of this reduction at larger scales.

Abstract: The Query, Key, Value weight triplet is a building block of current attention
mechanisms in state-of-the-art LLMs. We theoretically investigate whether this
triplet can be reduced, proving under simplifying assumptions that the Query
weights are redundant, thereby reducing the number of non-embedding/lm-head
parameters by over 8%. We validate the theory on full-complexity GPT-3 small
architectures (with layer normalization, skip connections, and weight decay)
trained from scratch, demonstrating that the reduced model achieves comparable
validation loss to standard baselines. These findings motivate the
investigation of the Query weight redundancy at scale.

TL;DR: The paper extends geometric interpretation of MDPs from discounted-reward to average-reward cases, unifying both approaches and proving geometric convergence of Value Iteration for ergodic optimal policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the theoretical gap between average-reward and discounted-reward MDP analyses by extending geometric interpretations to unify both cases.

Method: Extends geometric interpretation of MDPs from discounted-reward to average-reward case, enabling unified analysis framework.

Result: Proves that Value Iteration algorithm achieves geometric convergence rate under unique and ergodic optimal policy for average-reward MDPs.

Conclusion: Successfully unifies average-reward and discounted-reward MDP analyses through geometric interpretation, extending key convergence results to both cases.

Abstract: The theoretical analysis of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) is commonly
split into two cases - the average-reward case and the discounted-reward case -
which, while sharing similarities, are typically analyzed separately. In this
work, we extend a recently introduced geometric interpretation of MDPs for the
discounted-reward case to the average-reward case, thereby unifying both. This
allows us to extend a major result known for the discounted-reward case to the
average-reward case: under a unique and ergodic optimal policy, the Value
Iteration algorithm achieves a geometric convergence rate.

*Ningfeng Yang,Tor M. Aamodt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FOGZO combines first-order STE gradients with zeroth-order methods to improve quantization-aware training, achieving better accuracy with reduced computation compared to pure ZO methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training neural networks with quantized parameters is challenging - STE provides biased gradients while ZO methods are unbiased but computationally expensive. There's a need to balance gradient quality and computational efficiency.

Method: Proposed First-Order-Guided Zeroth-Order Gradient Descent (FOGZO) that reduces STE bias while requiring fewer computations than pure ZO methods by combining both approaches.

Result: FOGZO improves accuracy by 1-8% for DeiT Tiny/Small, 1-2% for ResNet 18/50, and reduces perplexity by 1-22 points for LLaMA models. Achieves 796× computation reduction versus n-SPSA for same loss on MLP.

Conclusion: FOGZO provides an effective tradeoff between training quality and computational efficiency for quantization-aware pre-training, outperforming both STE and pure ZO methods.

Abstract: We study the problem of training neural networks with quantized parameters.
Learning low-precision quantized parameters by enabling computation of
gradients via the Straight-Through Estimator (STE) can be challenging. While
the STE enables back-propagation, which is a first-order method, recent works
have explored the use of zeroth-order (ZO) gradient descent for fine-tuning. We
note that the STE provides high-quality biased gradients, and ZO gradients are
unbiased but can be expensive. We thus propose First-Order-Guided Zeroth-Order
Gradient Descent (FOGZO) that reduces STE bias while reducing computations
relative to ZO methods. Empirically, we show FOGZO improves the tradeoff
between quality and training time in Quantization-Aware Pre-Training.
Specifically, versus STE at the same number of iterations, we show a 1-8\%
accuracy improvement for DeiT Tiny/Small, 1-2\% accuracy improvement on ResNet
18/50, and 1-22 perplexity point improvement for LLaMA models with up to 0.3
billion parameters. For the same loss, FOGZO yields a 796$\times$ reduction in
computation versus n-SPSA for a 2-layer MLP on MNIST. Code is available at

*Miguel Fernandez-de-Retana,Unai Zulaika,Rubén Sánchez-Corcuera,Aitor Almeida*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DP-SGD effectively mitigates gradient leakage attacks in federated learning with moderate utility trade-off, while PDP-SGD maintains strong performance but fails as a practical defense against reconstruction attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning remains vulnerable to Gradient Leakage Attacks that can reveal private information from shared model updates, creating critical threats to data security and privacy.

Method: Evaluated DP-SGD and PDP-SGD (explicit regularization variant) as defenses against GLAs by training computer vision models under varying privacy levels and analyzing private data reconstructions from intercepted gradients in simulated FL environment.

Result: DP-SGD significantly mitigates gradient leakage risk with moderate utility trade-off, while PDP-SGD maintains strong classification performance but is ineffective against reconstruction attacks.

Conclusion: Empirical evaluation of privacy mechanisms beyond theoretical guarantees is crucial in distributed learning, as information leakage poses critical threats to data security and privacy.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows for the training of Machine Learning models in
a collaborative manner without the need to share sensitive data. However, it
remains vulnerable to Gradient Leakage Attacks (GLAs), which can reveal private
information from the shared model updates. In this work, we investigate the
effectiveness of Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms - specifically, DP-SGD
and a variant based on explicit regularization (PDP-SGD) - as defenses against
GLAs. To this end, we evaluate the performance of several computer vision
models trained under varying privacy levels on a simple classification task,
and then analyze the quality of private data reconstructions obtained from the
intercepted gradients in a simulated FL environment. Our results demonstrate
that DP-SGD significantly mitigates the risk of gradient leakage attacks,
albeit with a moderate trade-off in model utility. In contrast, PDP-SGD
maintains strong classification performance but proves ineffective as a
practical defense against reconstruction attacks. These findings highlight the
importance of empirically evaluating privacy mechanisms beyond their
theoretical guarantees, particularly in distributed learning scenarios where
information leakage may represent an unassumable critical threat to data
security and privacy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A data-free neural operator for Navier-Stokes equations that eliminates need for training data, enables real-time ensemble forecasting, and works for 3D flows where previous methods failed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensemble simulations of high-dimensional flow models are computationally expensive for real-time applications, and existing neural operators require costly data and struggle with 3D flows.

Method: Physics-grounded architecture that takes initial/boundary conditions and forcing functions as input, eliminating need for paired solution data through data-free operator learning.

Result: Surpasses prior neural operators in accuracy across 2D benchmarks and 3D test cases, achieves greater efficiency than conventional solvers for ensembles, and successfully solves 3D Navier-Stokes equations.

Conclusion: This approach establishes a practical pathway toward data-free, high-fidelity PDE surrogates for scientific simulation and prediction by combining numerically grounded architecture with machine learning scalability.

Abstract: Ensemble simulations of high-dimensional flow models (e.g., Navier Stokes
type PDEs) are computationally prohibitive for real time applications. Neural
operators enable fast inference but are limited by costly data requirements and
poor generalization to 3D flows. We present a data-free operator network for
the Navier Stokes equations that eliminates the need for paired solution data
and enables robust, real time inference for large ensemble forecasting. The
physics-grounded architecture takes initial and boundary conditions as well as
forcing functions, yielding solutions robust to high variability and
perturbations. Across 2D benchmarks and 3D test cases, the method surpasses
prior neural operators in accuracy and, for ensembles, achieves greater
efficiency than conventional numerical solvers. Notably, it delivers accurate
solutions of the three dimensional Navier Stokes equations, a regime not
previously demonstrated for data free neural operators. By uniting a
numerically grounded architecture with the scalability of machine learning,
this approach establishes a practical pathway toward data free, high fidelity
PDE surrogates for end to end scientific simulation and prediction.

Abstract: In this work, a three-dimensional multicomponent reaction-diffusion model has
been developed, combining excitable-system dynamics with diffusion processes
and sharing conceptual features with the FitzHugh-Nagumo model. Designed to
capture the spatiotemporal behavior of biological systems, particularly
electrophysiological processes, the model was solved numerically to generate

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ChessQA is a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates LLM chess understanding across five task categories (Structural, Motifs, Short Tactics, Position Judgment, and Semantic) to provide a more complete assessment than previous simple move quality evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations of LLM chess ability are ad hoc and narrow, making it difficult to accurately measure chess understanding and how it varies with model scale, post-training, or architecture choices. Chess provides an ideal testbed with well-defined structure and objective ground truth.

Method: Developed ChessQA benchmark with five task categories that correspond to ascending abstractions in chess knowledge: from basic rules to tactical motifs, calculation, position evaluation, and high-level semantic concepts. The benchmark is dynamic with evolving prompts, answer keys, and construction scripts.

Result: Evaluation of contemporary LLMs revealed persistent weaknesses across all five categories. The benchmark provides controlled, consistent setting for diagnosis and comparison of chess understanding.

Conclusion: ChessQA offers a comprehensive framework for assessing LLM chess ability beyond simple move quality, with plans to release code, datasets, and a public leaderboard to support ongoing research in this domain.

Abstract: Chess provides an ideal testbed for evaluating the reasoning, modeling, and
abstraction capabilities of large language models (LLMs), as it has
well-defined structure and objective ground truth while admitting a wide
spectrum of skill levels. However, existing evaluations of LLM ability in chess
are ad hoc and narrow in scope, making it difficult to accurately measure LLM
chess understanding and how it varies with scale, post-training methodologies,
or architecture choices. We present ChessQA, a comprehensive benchmark that
assesses LLM chess understanding across five task categories (Structural,
Motifs, Short Tactics, Position Judgment, and Semantic), which approximately
correspond to the ascending abstractions that players master as they accumulate
chess knowledge, from understanding basic rules and learning tactical motifs to
correctly calculating tactics, evaluating positions, and semantically
describing high-level concepts. In this way, ChessQA captures a more
comprehensive picture of chess ability and understanding, going significantly
beyond the simple move quality evaluations done previously, and offers a
controlled, consistent setting for diagnosis and comparison. Furthermore,
ChessQA is inherently dynamic, with prompts, answer keys, and construction
scripts that can evolve as models improve. Evaluating a range of contemporary
LLMs, we find persistent weaknesses across all five categories and provide
results and error analyses by category. We will release the code, periodically
refreshed datasets, and a public leaderboard to support further research.

TL;DR: Proposes metrics to measure Chain-of-Thought monitorability through legibility and coverage, implemented via an LLM-based autorater prompt, finding high monitorability in frontier models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To preserve AI safety through Chain-of-Thought monitoring by measuring monitorability components before potential shifts in training or architecture make monitoring difficult.

Method: Developed metrics for legibility (human-followable reasoning) and coverage (complete reasoning for human reproduction), implemented with an autorater prompt that enables LLMs to compute these metrics on existing CoTs.

Result: Sanity-checked with synthetic CoT degradations and applied to frontier models on challenging benchmarks, finding they exhibit high monitorability.

Conclusion: The metrics and autorater prompt provide a tool for developers to track monitorability impact of design decisions, complementing adversarial testing for robust safety evaluation.

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) monitoring offers a unique opportunity for AI
safety, this opportunity could be lost through shifts in training practices or
model architecture. To help preserve monitorability, we propose a pragmatic way
to measure two components of it: legibility (whether the reasoning can be
followed by a human) and coverage (whether the CoT contains all the reasoning
needed for a human to also produce the final output). We implement these
metrics with an autorater prompt that enables any capable LLM to compute the
legibility and coverage of existing CoTs. After sanity-checking our prompted
autorater with synthetic CoT degradations, we apply it to several frontier
models on challenging benchmarks, finding that they exhibit high
monitorability. We present these metrics, including our complete autorater
prompt, as a tool for developers to track how design decisions impact
monitorability. While the exact prompt we share is still a preliminary version
under ongoing development, we are sharing it now in the hopes that others in
the community will find it useful. Our method helps measure the default
monitorability of CoT - it should be seen as a complement, not a replacement,
for the adversarial stress-testing needed to test robustness against
deliberately evasive models.

Conclusion: The proposed all-transistor probabilistic computer addresses limitations of previous approaches and demonstrates significant energy efficiency improvements for probabilistic AI applications.

Abstract: The proliferation of probabilistic AI has promoted proposals for specialized

TL;DR: DATE is a method that dynamically updates text embeddings at each diffusion timestep during image generation, improving text-image alignment without requiring model retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed text embeddings across all diffusion timesteps limit adaptability to the generative process and reduce text-image alignment.

Method: Formulates an optimization problem to dynamically update text embeddings at each sampling step based on intermediate perturbed data, refining embeddings to improve alignment between predicted images and text.

Result: DATE maintains generative capability while providing superior text-image alignment across various tasks including multi-concept generation and text-guided image editing.

Conclusion: Dynamic text embedding adaptation during diffusion sampling significantly improves text-image alignment without additional training requirements.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models rely on text embeddings from a pre-trained
text encoder, but these embeddings remain fixed across all diffusion timesteps,
limiting their adaptability to the generative process. We propose Diffusion
Adaptive Text Embedding (DATE), which dynamically updates text embeddings at
each diffusion timestep based on intermediate perturbed data. We formulate an
optimization problem and derive an update rule that refines the text embeddings
at each sampling step to improve alignment and preference between the mean
predicted image and the text. This allows DATE to dynamically adapts the text
conditions to the reverse-diffused images throughout diffusion sampling without
requiring additional model training. Through theoretical analysis and empirical
results, we show that DATE maintains the generative capability of the model
while providing superior text-image alignment over fixed text embeddings across
various tasks, including multi-concept generation and text-guided image
editing. Our code is available at https://github.com/aailab-kaist/DATE.

TL;DR: SynCast is a neural forecasting model that improves air pollution prediction, especially for extreme events, using transformer architecture and diffusion-based refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Air pollution is a major global health risk, but existing models often underestimate hazardous pollution spikes from wildfires, haze, and dust storms.

Method: Uses a regionally adapted transformer backbone with diffusion-based stochastic refinement, integrating meteorological and air composition data from ERA5 and CAMS datasets.

Result: Shows substantial gains in forecasting accuracy for PM1, PM2.5, and PM10, particularly under extreme conditions, without compromising global accuracy.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable foundation for next-generation air quality early warning systems and supports climate-health risk mitigation in vulnerable regions.

Abstract: Air pollution remains a leading global health and environmental risk,
particularly in regions vulnerable to episodic air pollution spikes due to
wildfires, urban haze and dust storms. Accurate forecasting of particulate
matter (PM) concentrations is essential to enable timely public health warnings
and interventions, yet existing models often underestimate rare but hazardous
pollution events. Here, we present SynCast, a high-resolution neural
forecasting model that integrates meteorological and air composition data to
improve predictions of both average and extreme pollution levels. Built on a
regionally adapted transformer backbone and enhanced with a diffusion-based
stochastic refinement module, SynCast captures the nonlinear dynamics driving
PM spikes more accurately than existing approaches. Leveraging on harmonized
ERA5 and CAMS datasets, our model shows substantial gains in forecasting
fidelity across multiple PM variables (PM$_1$, PM$_{2.5}$, PM$_{10}$),
especially under extreme conditions. We demonstrate that conventional loss
functions underrepresent distributional tails (rare pollution events) and show
that SynCast, guided by domain-aware objectives and extreme value theory,
significantly enhances performance in highly impacted regions without
compromising global accuracy. This approach provides a scalable foundation for
next-generation air quality early warning systems and supports climate-health
risk mitigation in vulnerable regions.

*Hong Wang,Jiang Yixuan,Jie Wang,Xinyi Li,Jian Luo,Huanshuo Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STNet uses spectral transformations to enhance deep learning methods for operator eigenvalue problems by applying deflation projection and filter transforms to improve convergence and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Numerical methods for operator eigenvalue problems suffer from the curse of dimensionality, and existing deep learning methods' performance depends heavily on the operator's spectral distribution.

Method: STNet performs spectral transformations using approximate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions: deflation projection excludes solved eigenfunction subspaces, and filter transform magnifies eigenvalues in desired regions while suppressing others.

Result: Extensive experiments show STNet consistently outperforms existing learning-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy.

Conclusion: Spectral transformations effectively enhance deep learning methods for operator eigenvalue problems, with STNet demonstrating superior performance through deflation projection and filter transforms.

Abstract: Operator eigenvalue problems play a critical role in various scientific
fields and engineering applications, yet numerical methods are hindered by the
curse of dimensionality. Recent deep learning methods provide an efficient
approach to address this challenge by iteratively updating neural networks.
These methods' performance relies heavily on the spectral distribution of the
given operator: larger gaps between the operator's eigenvalues will improve
precision, thus tailored spectral transformations that leverage the spectral
distribution can enhance their performance. Based on this observation, we
propose the Spectral Transformation Network (STNet). During each iteration,
STNet uses approximate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions to perform spectral
transformations on the original operator, turning it into an equivalent but
easier problem. Specifically, we employ deflation projection to exclude the
subspace corresponding to already solved eigenfunctions, thereby reducing the
search space and avoiding converging to existing eigenfunctions. Additionally,
our filter transform magnifies eigenvalues in the desired region and suppresses
those outside, further improving performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that STNet consistently outperforms existing learning-based methods, achieving
state-of-the-art performance in accuracy.

*Geoffery Agorku,Sarah Hernandez,Hayley Hames,Cade Wagner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Using AIS vessel tracking data and machine learning to predict barge quantities on inland waterways, achieving MAE of 1.92 barges with Poisson Regressor model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate real-time estimation of barge quantity is critical but challenging due to non-self-propelled nature of barges and limitations of existing monitoring systems.

Method: Used AIS vessel tracking data with 30 features, applied Recursive Feature Elimination to select predictive variables, and tested six regression models including ensemble, kernel-based, and generalized linear approaches.

Result: Poisson Regressor performed best with MAE of 1.92 barges using 12 features. Key predictive features were vessel maneuverability metrics like course entropy, speed variability, and trip length.

Conclusion: Provides scalable method for enhancing Maritime Domain Awareness with applications in lock scheduling, port management, and freight planning. Future work will explore model transferability to other inland rivers.

Abstract: Accurate, real-time estimation of barge quantity on inland waterways remains
a critical challenge due to the non-self-propelled nature of barges and the
limitations of existing monitoring systems. This study introduces a novel
method to use Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel tracking data to
predict the number of barges in tow using Machine Learning (ML). To train and
test the model, barge instances were manually annotated from satellite scenes
across the Lower Mississippi River. Labeled images were matched to AIS vessel
tracks using a spatiotemporal matching procedure. A comprehensive set of 30
AIS-derived features capturing vessel geometry, dynamic movement, and
trajectory patterns were created and evaluated using Recursive Feature
Elimination (RFE) to identify the most predictive variables. Six regression
models, including ensemble, kernel-based, and generalized linear approaches,
were trained and evaluated. The Poisson Regressor model yielded the best
performance, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.92 barges using 12 of
the 30 features. The feature importance analysis revealed that metrics
capturing vessel maneuverability such as course entropy, speed variability and
trip length were most predictive of barge count. The proposed approach provides
a scalable, readily implementable method for enhancing Maritime Domain
Awareness (MDA), with strong potential applications in lock scheduling, port
management, and freight planning. Future work will expand the proof of concept
presented here to explore model transferability to other inland rivers with
differing operational and environmental conditions.

*Byeonghu Na,Mina Kang,Jiseok Kwak,Minsang Park,Jiwoo Shin,SeJoon Jun,Gayoung Lee,Jin-Hwa Kim,Il-Chul Moon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STG is a training-free method that guides text embeddings during sampling to improve diffusion model safety without compromising generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models trained on web-crawled datasets can generate harmful content from malicious prompts, raising safety concerns.

Method: Safe Text embedding Guidance (STG) adjusts text embeddings based on safety evaluation of expected denoised images during sampling, without requiring additional training.

Result: STG outperforms both training-based and training-free baselines in removing unsafe content (nudity, violence, artist-style) while preserving semantic intent.

Conclusion: STG effectively aligns model distributions with safety constraints, providing a practical training-free solution for safer text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Text-to-image models have recently made significant advances in generating
realistic and semantically coherent images, driven by advanced diffusion models
and large-scale web-crawled datasets. However, these datasets often contain
inappropriate or biased content, raising concerns about the generation of
harmful outputs when provided with malicious text prompts. We propose Safe Text
embedding Guidance (STG), a training-free approach to improve the safety of
diffusion models by guiding the text embeddings during sampling. STG adjusts
the text embeddings based on a safety function evaluated on the expected final
denoised image, allowing the model to generate safer outputs without additional
training. Theoretically, we show that STG aligns the underlying model
distribution with safety constraints, thereby achieving safer outputs while
minimally affecting generation quality. Experiments on various safety
scenarios, including nudity, violence, and artist-style removal, show that STG
consistently outperforms both training-based and training-free baselines in
removing unsafe content while preserving the core semantic intent of input
prompts. Our code is available at https://github.com/aailab-kaist/STG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to capture temporal evolution characteristics of connections between specific functional communities in brain networks, which is important for understanding cognitive mechanisms and diagnosing neurological diseases.

Method: Extracts time series of connection strengths between functional partitions using medically supported static partitioning schemes (Yeo and Smith ICA), then models them using a temporal neural network to capture dynamic behavior of connection pathways.

Result: Validated on three public fMRI datasets, NeuroPathNet outperforms existing mainstream methods in multiple performance indicators.

Conclusion: The framework can promote development of dynamic graph learning methods for brain network analysis and provide potential clinical applications for neurological disease diagnosis.

Abstract: Understanding the evolution of brain functional networks over time is of
great significance for the analysis of cognitive mechanisms and the diagnosis
of neurological diseases. Existing methods often have difficulty in capturing
the temporal evolution characteristics of connections between specific
functional communities. To this end, this paper proposes a new path-level
trajectory modeling framework (NeuroPathNet) to characterize the dynamic
behavior of connection pathways between brain functional partitions. Based on
medically supported static partitioning schemes (such as Yeo and Smith ICA), we
extract the time series of connection strengths between each pair of functional
partitions and model them using a temporal neural network. We validate the
model performance on three public functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)
datasets, and the results show that it outperforms existing mainstream methods
in multiple indicators. This study can promote the development of dynamic graph
learning methods for brain network analysis, and provide possible clinical
applications for the diagnosis of neurological diseases.

*Jiaqi Luo,Shixin Xu,Zhouwang Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Global-Local Fusion (GLF) sampling strategy for PINNs that combines global exploration with local refinement through residual-adaptive sampling and lightweight surrogate approximation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs accuracy depends on collocation point placement. Global sampling is stable but computationally expensive, while local sampling is efficient but may neglect well-learned areas and reduce robustness.

Method: Proposes GLF sampling that generates new points by perturbing training points with Gaussian noise scaled inversely to residual. Uses lightweight linear surrogate to approximate global residual-based distribution for computational efficiency.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark PDEs show GLF consistently improves both accuracy and efficiency compared to global and local sampling strategies.

Conclusion: GLF provides a practical and scalable framework for enhancing PINNs reliability and efficiency in solving complex high-dimensional PDEs by preserving global stability while retaining local refinement efficiency.

Abstract: The accuracy of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) critically depends
on the placement of collocation points, as the PDE loss is approximated through
sampling over the solution domain. Global sampling ensures stability by
covering the entire domain but requires many samples and is computationally
expensive, whereas local sampling improves efficiency by focusing on
high-residual regions but may neglect well-learned areas, reducing robustness.
We propose a Global-Local Fusion (GLF) Sampling Strategy that combines the
strengths of both approaches. Specifically, new collocation points are
generated by perturbing training points with Gaussian noise scaled inversely to
the residual, thereby concentrating samples in difficult regions while
preserving exploration. To further reduce computational overhead, a lightweight
linear surrogate is introduced to approximate the global residual-based
distribution, achieving similar effectiveness at a fraction of the cost.
Together, these components, residual-adaptive sampling and residual-based
approximation, preserve the stability of global methods while retaining the
efficiency of local refinement. Extensive experiments on benchmark PDEs
demonstrate that GLF consistently improves both accuracy and efficiency
compared with global and local sampling strategies. This study provides a
practical and scalable framework for enhancing the reliability and efficiency
of PINNs in solving complex and high-dimensional PDEs.

*Zibo Liu,Zhe Jiang,Zelin Xu,Tingsong Xiao,Yupu Zhang,Zhengkun Xiao,Haibo Wang,Shigang Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new problem of STMF with chosen variables, proposing a unified framework that jointly performs variable selection and model optimization to maximize forecast accuracy when only m-out-of-n variables can be monitored due to budget constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing STMF methods assume pre-determined sensor locations, but the critical problem of optimally selecting which m variables to monitor from n possible locations has never been studied, despite practical budget constraints in sensing applications.

Method: Proposes a unified framework with three novel components: (1) masked variable-parameter pruning using quantile-based masking to progressively prune less informative variables, (2) prioritized variable-parameter replay to preserve learned knowledge using low-loss past samples, and (3) dynamic extrapolation mechanism to propagate information from selected variables to all others via spatial embeddings.

Result: Experiments on five real-world datasets show the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the effectiveness of joint variable selection and model optimization for STMF, filling an important gap in handling practical budget constraints in spatio-temporal sensing applications.

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Multivariate time series Forecast (STMF) uses the time series
of $n$ spatially distributed variables in a period of recent past to forecast
their values in a period of near future. It has important applications in
spatio-temporal sensing forecast such as road traffic prediction and air
pollution prediction. Recent papers have addressed a practical problem of
missing variables in the model input, which arises in the sensing applications
where the number $m$ of sensors is far less than the number $n$ of locations to
be monitored, due to budget constraints. We observe that the state of the art
assumes that the $m$ variables (i.e., locations with sensors) in the model
input are pre-determined and the important problem of how to choose the $m$
variables in the input has never been studied. This paper fills the gap by
studying a new problem of STMF with chosen variables, which optimally selects
$m$-out-of-$n$ variables for the model input in order to maximize the forecast
accuracy. We propose a unified framework that jointly performs variable
selection and model optimization for both forecast accuracy and model
efficiency. It consists of three novel technical components: (1) masked
variable-parameter pruning, which progressively prunes less informative
variables and attention parameters through quantile-based masking; (2)
prioritized variable-parameter replay, which replays low-loss past samples to
preserve learned knowledge for model stability; (3) dynamic extrapolation
mechanism, which propagates information from variables selected for the input
to all other variables via learnable spatial embeddings and adjacency
information. Experiments on five real-world datasets show that our work
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and
efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness of joint variable selection and
model optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of solving combinatorial optimization problems with discrete constraints using self-supervised learning, where traditional neural networks struggle with discrete feasibility.

Method: End-to-end differentiable framework leveraging convex geometry and Carathéodory's theorem to decompose neural network outputs into convex combinations of polytope corners corresponding to feasible sets, enabling quality-preserving rounding.

Result: Extensive experiments show consistent outperformance of neural baselines in cardinality-constrained optimization, with successful application to independent sets in graphs and matroid-constrained problems.

Conclusion: The proposed decomposition-based approach effectively enables self-supervised training for combinatorial optimization while ensuring feasible solutions through geometric techniques.

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for Combinatorial Optimization (CO) is an
emerging paradigm for solving combinatorial problems using neural networks. In
this paper, we address a central challenge of SSL for CO: solving problems with
discrete constraints. We design an end-to-end differentiable framework that
enables us to solve discrete constrained optimization problems with neural
networks. Concretely, we leverage algorithmic techniques from the literature on
convex geometry and Carath\'eodory's theorem to decompose neural network
outputs into convex combinations of polytope corners that correspond to
feasible sets. This decomposition-based approach enables self-supervised
training but also ensures efficient quality-preserving rounding of the neural
net output into feasible solutions. Extensive experiments in
cardinality-constrained optimization show that our approach can consistently
outperform neural baselines. We further provide worked-out examples of how our
method can be applied beyond cardinality-constrained problems to a diverse set
of combinatorial optimization tasks, including finding independent sets in
graphs, and solving matroid-constrained problems.

TL;DR: Two-Stage LKPLO is a multi-stage outlier detection framework that overcomes limitations of conventional projection-based methods by combining generalized loss-based outlyingness measures, global kernel PCA for non-linear data, and local clustering for multi-modal distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the coexisting limitations of conventional projection-based outlier detection methods: their reliance on fixed statistical metrics and assumption of single data structures, which fail on complex datasets.

Method: A two-stage framework that synthesizes: (1) generalized loss-based outlyingness measure (PLO) with flexible loss functions like SVM-like loss; (2) global kernel PCA stage to linearize non-linear data; (3) local clustering stage to handle multi-modal distributions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in 5-fold cross-validation on 10 benchmark datasets, significantly outperforming baselines on challenging structures like multi-cluster data (Optdigits) and high-dimensional data (Arrhythmia). Ablation study confirms both kernelization and localization stages are essential.

Conclusion: The work contributes a powerful tool for outlier detection problems and demonstrates the importance of hybrid, multi-stage architectures for handling complex data structures.

Abstract: This paper presents Two-Stage LKPLO, a novel multi-stage outlier detection
framework that overcomes the coexisting limitations of conventional
projection-based methods: their reliance on a fixed statistical metric and
their assumption of a single data structure. Our framework uniquely synthesizes
three key concepts: (1) a generalized loss-based outlyingness measure (PLO)
that replaces the fixed metric with flexible, adaptive loss functions like our
proposed SVM-like loss; (2) a global kernel PCA stage to linearize non-linear
data structures; and (3) a subsequent local clustering stage to handle
multi-modal distributions. Comprehensive 5-fold cross-validation experiments on
10 benchmark datasets, with automated hyperparameter optimization, demonstrate
that Two-Stage LKPLO achieves state-of-the-art performance. It significantly
outperforms strong baselines on datasets with challenging structures where
existing methods fail, most notably on multi-cluster data (Optdigits) and
complex, high-dimensional data (Arrhythmia). Furthermore, an ablation study
empirically confirms that the synergistic combination of both the kernelization
and localization stages is indispensable for its superior performance. This
work contributes a powerful new tool for a significant class of outlier

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes RED (Reducing Environmental Disagreement), a method that addresses negative transfer in unsupervised domain adaptation by disentangling causal and environmental features and reducing cross-domain disagreements on non-causal features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Significant domain shifts in UDA cause negative transfer, deteriorating model performance. The paper aims to mitigate negative transfer by focusing on cross-domain discriminative disagreement on non-causal environmental features.

Method: RED disentangles samples into domain-invariant causal features and domain-specific non-causal environmental features using adversarially trained domain-specific environmental feature extractors. It then estimates and reduces environmental disagreement based on domain-specific non-causal features.

Result: Experimental results show that RED effectively mitigates negative transfer and achieves state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised domain adaptation.

Conclusion: The proposed RED method successfully addresses negative transfer in UDA by reducing environmental disagreement through causal feature disentanglement, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation~(UDA) focuses on transferring knowledge from a
labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, addressing the challenge
of \emph{domain shift}. Significant domain shifts hinder effective knowledge
transfer, leading to \emph{negative transfer} and deteriorating model
performance. Therefore, mitigating negative transfer is essential. This study
revisits negative transfer through the lens of causally disentangled learning,
emphasizing cross-domain discriminative disagreement on non-causal
environmental features as a critical factor. Our theoretical analysis reveals
that overreliance on non-causal environmental features as the environment
evolves can cause discriminative disagreements~(termed \emph{environmental
disagreement}), thereby resulting in negative transfer. To address this, we
propose Reducing Environmental Disagreement~(RED), which disentangles each
sample into domain-invariant causal features and domain-specific non-causal
environmental features via adversarially training domain-specific environmental
feature extractors in the opposite domains. Subsequently, RED estimates and
reduces environmental disagreement based on domain-specific non-causal
environmental features. Experimental results confirm that RED effectively
mitigates negative transfer and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tabular data generation methods struggle with capturing complex causal relationships, maintaining data utility, and providing provable privacy guarantees needed for enterprise deployment.

Method: Two-step approach: causal graph extraction to learn comprehensive causal relationships, followed by a custom Conditional WGAN-GP that operates according to the causal graph structure. The generator is trained with a Reinforcement Learning-based objective that aligns causal graphs from real and fake data.

Result: CA-GAN demonstrates superiority over six state-of-the-art methods across 14 tabular datasets, excelling in causal preservation, utility preservation, and privacy preservation metrics.

Conclusion: CA-GAN offers a practical, high-performance solution for creating high-quality, privacy-compliant synthetic datasets suitable for database benchmarking, software development acceleration, and secure data-driven research.

Abstract: The utility of tabular data for tasks ranging from model training to
large-scale data analysis is often constrained by privacy concerns or
regulatory hurdles. While existing data generation methods, particularly those
based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have shown promise, they
frequently struggle with capturing complex causal relationship, maintaining
data utility, and providing provable privacy guarantees suitable for enterprise
deployment. We introduce CA-GAN, a novel generative framework specifically
engineered to address these challenges for real-world tabular datasets. CA-GAN
utilizes a two-step approach: causal graph extraction to learn a robust,
comprehensive causal relationship in the data's manifold, followed by a custom
Conditional WGAN-GP (Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty) that operates
exclusively as per the structure of nodes in the causal graph. More
importantly, the generator is trained with a new Reinforcement Learning-based
objective that aligns the causal graphs constructed from real and fake data,
ensuring the causal awareness in both training and sampling phases. We
demonstrate CA-GAN superiority over six SOTA methods across 14 tabular
datasets. Our evaluations, focused on core data engineering metrics: causal
preservation, utility preservation, and privacy preservation. Our method offers
a practical, high-performance solution for data engineers seeking to create
high-quality, privacy-compliant synthetic datasets to benchmark database
systems, accelerate software development, and facilitate secure data-driven
research.

TL;DR: RAP is a hybrid framework combining deep learning with historical data retrieval to improve long-term spatiotemporal prediction by using historical analogs as dynamic guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models suffer from error accumulation in long-term autoregressive rollouts, leading to physically implausible artifacts due to their purely parametric nature.

Method: Retrieval-Augmented Prediction (RAP) framework that retrieves similar historical analogs from a database and uses their true future evolution as reference targets in a dual-stream architecture for dynamic guidance.

Result: RAP surpasses state-of-the-art methods and analog-only forecasting baseline across meteorology, turbulence, and fire simulation, generating more physically realistic predictions with suppressed error divergence.

Conclusion: RAP effectively addresses the limitations of purely parametric models by synergizing deep networks with historical data, enabling more accurate and physically viable long-term predictions.

Abstract: Accurate and long-term spatiotemporal prediction for complex physical systems
remains a fundamental challenge in scientific computing. While deep learning
models, as powerful parametric approximators, have shown remarkable success,
they suffer from a critical limitation: the accumulation of errors during
long-term autoregressive rollouts often leads to physically implausible
artifacts. This deficiency arises from their purely parametric nature, which
struggles to capture the full constraints of a system's intrinsic dynamics. To
address this, we introduce a novel \textbf{Retrieval-Augmented Prediction
(RAP)} framework, a hybrid paradigm that synergizes the predictive power of
deep networks with the grounded truth of historical data. The core philosophy
of RAP is to leverage historical evolutionary exemplars as a non-parametric
estimate of the system's local dynamics. For any given state, RAP efficiently
retrieves the most similar historical analog from a large-scale database. The
true future evolution of this analog then serves as a \textbf{reference
target}. Critically, this target is not a hard constraint in the loss function
but rather a powerful conditional input to a specialized dual-stream
architecture. It provides strong \textbf{dynamic guidance}, steering the
model's predictions towards physically viable trajectories. In extensive
benchmarks across meteorology, turbulence, and fire simulation, RAP not only
surpasses state-of-the-art methods but also significantly outperforms a strong
\textbf{analog-only forecasting baseline}. More importantly, RAP generates
predictions that are more physically realistic by effectively suppressing error
divergence in long-term rollouts.

TL;DR: FolDE is an Active Learning-assisted Directed Evolution method that overcomes data homogeneity issues in protein optimization by using naturalness-based warm-starting and constant-liar batch selection to discover more top-performing mutants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional protein optimization is costly, and existing ALDE methods suffer from selecting only highest-predicted mutants, creating homogeneous training data that limits subsequent prediction accuracy.

Method: FolDE uses naturalness-based warm-starting (augmenting limited activity measurements with protein language model outputs) and constant-liar batch selector to improve batch diversity and activity prediction.

Result: In simulations across 20 protein targets, FolDE discovers 23% more top 10% mutants than the best baseline ALDE method (p=0.005) and is 55% more likely to find top 1% mutants.

Conclusion: FolDE significantly improves protein optimization efficiency through its warm-starting approach and is available as open-source software for broader laboratory accessibility.

Abstract: Proteins are traditionally optimized through the costly construction and
measurement of many mutants. Active Learning-assisted Directed Evolution (ALDE)
alleviates that cost by predicting the best improvements and iteratively
testing mutants to inform predictions. However, existing ALDE methods face a
critical limitation: selecting the highest-predicted mutants in each round
yields homogeneous training data insufficient for accurate prediction models in
subsequent rounds. Here we present FolDE, an ALDE method designed to maximize
end-of-campaign success. In simulations across 20 protein targets, FolDE
discovers 23% more top 10% mutants than the best baseline ALDE method (p=0.005)
and is 55% more likely to find top 1% mutants. FolDE achieves this primarily
through naturalness-based warm-starting, which augments limited activity
measurements with protein language model outputs to improve activity
prediction. We also introduce a constant-liar batch selector, which improves
batch diversity; this is important in multi-mutation campaigns but had limited
effect in our benchmarks. The complete workflow is freely available as
open-source software, making efficient protein optimization accessible to any

### [153] [FALQON: Accelerating LoRA Fine-tuning with Low-Bit Floating-Point Arithmetic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24061)
*Kanghyun Choi,Hyeyoon Lee,SunJong Park,Dain Kwon,Jinho Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FALQON is a framework that eliminates quantization overhead in FP8 LoRA fine-tuning by merging LoRA adapters directly into the quantized backbone and optimizing computations, achieving 3x speedup over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FP8 quantization provides acceleration for large matrix operations but has significant overhead when applied to LoRA fine-tuning due to small-dimensional matrices, limiting its effectiveness for efficient LLM fine-tuning.

Method: Directly merges LoRA adapters into FP8-quantized backbone during fine-tuning, reformulates forward/backward computations to reduce quantization overhead, and introduces row-wise proxy update mechanism for efficient integration of updates.

Result: Achieves approximately 3x training speedup over existing quantized LoRA methods while maintaining similar accuracy, and enables end-to-end FP8 workflow without post-training quantization.

Conclusion: FALQON provides a practical solution for efficient large-scale model fine-tuning by overcoming FP8 quantization limitations in LoRA, facilitating both faster training and efficient deployment.

Abstract: Low-bit floating-point (FP) formats, such as FP8, provide significant
acceleration and memory savings in model training thanks to native hardware
support on modern GPUs and NPUs. However, we analyze that FP8 quantization
offers speedup primarily for large-dimensional matrix multiplications, while
inherent quantization overheads diminish speedup when applied to low-rank
adaptation (LoRA), which uses small-dimensional matrices for efficient
fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). To address this limitation, we
propose FALQON, a novel framework that eliminates the quantization overhead
from separate LoRA computational paths by directly merging LoRA adapters into
an FP8-quantized backbone during fine-tuning. Furthermore, we reformulate the
forward and backward computations for merged adapters to significantly reduce
quantization overhead, and introduce a row-wise proxy update mechanism that
efficiently integrates substantial updates into the quantized backbone.
Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FALQON achieves approximately a
3$\times$ training speedup over existing quantized LoRA methods with a similar
level of accuracy, providing a practical solution for efficient large-scale
model fine-tuning. Moreover, FALQON's end-to-end FP8 workflow removes the need
for post-training quantization, facilitating efficient deployment. Code is

### [154] [What do vision-language models see in the context? Investigating multimodal in-context learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24331)
*Gabriel O. dos Santos,Esther Colombini,Sandra Avila*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Systematic study of in-context learning in Vision-Language Models reveals limitations in multimodal integration, with VLMs focusing mainly on textual cues and showing trade-offs between instruction alignment and in-context adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In-context learning has been extensively studied in LLMs but remains underexplored in Vision-Language Models, despite their growing importance in multimodal tasks.

Method: Evaluated seven VLMs across four architectures on three image captioning benchmarks, analyzing prompt design, architectural choices, training strategies, and attention patterns with increasing in-context demonstrations.

Result: Training on image-text interleaved data improves ICL performance but doesn't ensure effective multimodal integration. Instruction tuning improves instruction-following but reduces reliance on in-context demonstrations. Attention analyses show VLMs primarily focus on textual cues and fail to leverage visual information.

Conclusion: Current VLMs have limited capacity for multimodal integration in ICL, highlighting key limitations that need addressing to enhance their ability to learn from multimodal in-context examples.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn tasks
from demonstration examples without parameter updates. Although it has been
extensively studied in LLMs, its effectiveness in Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
remains underexplored. In this work, we present a systematic study of ICL in
VLMs, evaluating seven models spanning four architectures on three image
captioning benchmarks. We analyze how prompt design, architectural choices, and
training strategies influence multimodal ICL. To our knowledge, we are the
first to analyze how attention patterns in VLMs vary with an increasing number
of in-context demonstrations. Our results reveal that training on imag-text
interleaved data enhances ICL performance but does not imply effective
integration of visual and textual information from demonstration examples. In
contrast, instruction tuning improves instruction-following but can reduce
reliance on in-context demonstrations, suggesting a trade-off between
instruction alignment and in-context adaptation. Attention analyses further
show that current VLMs primarily focus on textual cues and fail to leverage
visual information, suggesting a limited capacity for multimodal integration.
These findings highlight key limitations in the ICL abilities of current VLMs
and provide insights for enhancing their ability to learn from multimodal
in-context examples.

TL;DR: DEPS is an end-to-end algorithm that discovers parameterized skills from expert demonstrations by learning skill policies jointly with a meta-policy, using temporal variational inference and information-theoretic regularization to ensure meaningful and adaptable skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of degeneracy in latent variable models and improve generalization to unseen tasks by learning parameterized skills from multitask expert demonstrations.

Method: Combines temporal variational inference with information-theoretic regularization to learn parameterized skill policies jointly with a meta-policy that selects discrete skills and continuous parameters at each timestep.

Result: Outperforms multitask and skill learning baselines on LIBERO and MetaWorld benchmarks, significantly improving generalization to unseen tasks and discovering interpretable parameterized skills like object grasping with continuous grasp location parameters.

Conclusion: DEPS effectively discovers temporally extended, semantically meaningful, and adaptable parameterized skills from expert demonstrations, enabling better generalization and interpretable skill representations.

Abstract: We present DEPS, an end-to-end algorithm for discovering parameterized skills
from expert demonstrations. Our method learns parameterized skill policies
jointly with a meta-policy that selects the appropriate discrete skill and
continuous parameters at each timestep. Using a combination of temporal
variational inference and information-theoretic regularization methods, we
address the challenge of degeneracy common in latent variable models, ensuring
that the learned skills are temporally extended, semantically meaningful, and
adaptable. We empirically show that learning parameterized skills from
multitask expert demonstrations significantly improves generalization to unseen
tasks. Our method outperforms multitask as well as skill learning baselines on
both LIBERO and MetaWorld benchmarks. We also demonstrate that DEPS discovers
interpretable parameterized skills, such as an object grasping skill whose
continuous arguments define the grasp location.

*Ziyu Liu,Yijing Liu,Jianfei Yuan,Minzhi Yan,Le Yue,Honghui Xiong,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: G2ConS reduces costs of graph-based RAG by selecting important document chunks and using a concept graph to fill knowledge gaps, outperforming baselines in cost and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph-based RAG methods are expensive due to numerous LLM calls needed to extract entities and relations from text chunks, making them prohibitive at scale.

Method: Proposes Graph-Guided Concept Selection (G2ConS) with two components: chunk selection to reduce KG construction costs, and an LLM-independent concept graph to close knowledge gaps from chunk selection.

Result: Evaluations on multiple real-world datasets show G2ConS outperforms all baselines in construction cost, retrieval effectiveness, and answering quality.

Conclusion: G2ConS effectively reduces costs while maintaining or improving performance in graph-based RAG systems for question answering.

Abstract: Graph-based RAG constructs a knowledge graph (KG) from text chunks to enhance
retrieval in Large Language Model (LLM)-based question answering. It is
especially beneficial in domains such as biomedicine, law, and political
science, where effective retrieval often involves multi-hop reasoning over
proprietary documents. However, these methods demand numerous LLM calls to
extract entities and relations from text chunks, incurring prohibitive costs at
scale. Through a carefully designed ablation study, we observe that certain
words (termed concepts) and their associated documents are more important.
Based on this insight, we propose Graph-Guided Concept Selection (G2ConS). Its
core comprises a chunk selection method and an LLM-independent concept graph.
The former selects salient document chunks to reduce KG construction costs; the
latter closes knowledge gaps introduced by chunk selection at zero cost.
Evaluations on multiple real-world datasets show that G2ConS outperforms all
baselines in construction cost, retrieval effectiveness, and answering quality.

### [157] [Local Performance vs. Out-of-Distribution Generalization: An Empirical Analysis of Personalized Federated Learning in Heterogeneous Data Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24503)
*Mortesa Hussaini,Jan Theiß,Anthony Stein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses client drift in Federated Learning with heterogeneous data by proposing FLIU, a modified FedAvg approach with adaptive personalization that balances local performance and generalization to out-of-distribution samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Local models in Federated Learning converge to their own optima during training, causing client drift when aggregated with FedAvg. While personalized FL focuses on local performance, it neglects generalization capabilities which are crucial for robustness.

Method: Proposes FLIU (Federated Learning with Individualized Updates), extending FedAvg with an individualization step using adaptive personalization factor. Evaluates different stages within communication rounds and tests on MNIST and CIFAR-10 under various distributional conditions including IID, pathological non-IID, and novel Dirichlet distributions.

Result: The study provides thorough evaluation of FL approaches comparing both local performance and generalization capabilities. FLIU is empirically evaluated and compared against other methods under complex data heterogeneity scenarios.

Conclusion: FLIU offers a balanced approach that addresses client drift while maintaining generalization capabilities, providing better performance in heterogeneous data environments compared to standard FedAvg and purely personalized approaches.

Abstract: In the context of Federated Learning with heterogeneous data environments,
local models tend to converge to their own local model optima during local
training steps, deviating from the overall data distributions. Aggregation of
these local updates, e.g., with FedAvg, often does not align with the global
model optimum (client drift), resulting in an update that is suboptimal for
most clients. Personalized Federated Learning approaches address this challenge
by exclusively focusing on the average local performances of clients' models on
their own data distribution. Generalization to out-of-distribution samples,
which is a substantial benefit of FedAvg and represents a significant component
of robustness, appears to be inadequately incorporated into the assessment and
evaluation processes. This study involves a thorough evaluation of Federated
Learning approaches, encompassing both their local performance and their
generalization capabilities. Therefore, we examine different stages within a
single communication round to enable a more nuanced understanding of the
considered metrics. Furthermore, we propose and incorporate a modified approach
of FedAvg, designated as Federated Learning with Individualized Updates (FLIU),
extending the algorithm by a straightforward individualization step with an
adaptive personalization factor. We evaluate and compare the approaches
empirically using MNIST and CIFAR-10 under various distributional conditions,
including benchmark IID and pathological non-IID, as well as additional novel
test environments with Dirichlet distribution specifically developed to stress
the algorithms on complex data heterogeneity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Causal CNNs with quasi-linear activations behave like FIR filters when trained on multimodal frequency time-series data, offering enhanced interpretability and equivalent single-layer filter representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how Causal CNNs process time-series data with multimodal frequency content and explore their equivalence to traditional signal processing filters for improved interpretability in dynamic systems modeling.

Method: Used Causal CNNs with quasi-linear activation functions and extended convolutional kernels on time-series data, leveraging the associative property of convolution to reduce networks to equivalent single-layer FIR filters optimized via least-squares criteria.

Result: Causal CNNs capture spectral features implicitly and explicitly, and entire networks can be reduced to equivalent FIR filters. Validated on simulated beam dynamics and real-world bridge vibration datasets.

Conclusion: Causal CNNs exhibit FIR filter-like properties when trained on multimodal frequency signals, providing enhanced interpretability and new insights into spectral learning behavior for dynamic system modeling.

Abstract: This study investigates the behavior of Causal Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) with quasi-linear activation functions when applied to time-series data
characterized by multimodal frequency content. We demonstrate that, once
trained, such networks exhibit properties analogous to Finite Impulse Response
(FIR) filters, particularly when the convolutional kernels are of extended
length exceeding those typically employed in standard CNN architectures. Causal
CNNs are shown to capture spectral features both implicitly and explicitly,
offering enhanced interpretability for tasks involving dynamic systems.
Leveraging the associative property of convolution, we further show that the
entire network can be reduced to an equivalent single-layer filter resembling
an FIR filter optimized via least-squares criteria. This equivalence yields new
insights into the spectral learning behavior of CNNs trained on signals with
sparse frequency content. The approach is validated on both simulated beam
dynamics and real-world bridge vibration datasets, underlining its relevance
for modeling and identifying physical systems governed by dynamic responses.

TL;DR: A deep learning framework for fast and accurate parameter identification of electrochemical battery models, achieving 2000x speedup and 10x higher accuracy compared to conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid expansion of electric vehicles requires efficient battery health assessment, but conventional metaheuristic methods are computationally expensive and slow, while recent ML methods rely on constant current data not available in practice.

Method: Combines a neural surrogate model (NeuralSPMe) trained on realistic EV load profiles with a parameter update network (PUNet) using deep learning-based fixed-point iteration to reduce evaluation time and iterations needed for convergence.

Result: The framework accelerates parameter identification by more than 2000 times, achieves superior sample efficiency, and more than 10 times higher accuracy compared to conventional metaheuristic algorithms, especially under dynamic load scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed deep learning framework provides a highly efficient and accurate solution for battery parameter identification that overcomes limitations of existing methods and performs well under practical dynamic operating conditions.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of electric vehicles has intensified the need for
accurate and efficient diagnosis of lithium-ion batteries. Parameter
identification of electrochemical battery models is widely recognized as a
powerful method for battery health assessment. However, conventional
metaheuristic approaches suffer from high computational cost and slow
convergence, and recent machine learning methods are limited by their reliance
on constant current data, which may not be available in practice. To overcome
these challenges, we propose deep learning-based framework for parameter
identification of electrochemical battery models. The proposed framework
combines a neural surrogate model of the single particle model with electrolyte
(NeuralSPMe) and a deep learning-based fixed-point iteration method. NeuralSPMe
is trained on realistic EV load profiles to accurately predict lithium
concentration dynamics under dynamic operating conditions while a parameter
update network (PUNet) performs fixed-point iterative updates to significantly
reduce both the evaluation time per sample and the overall number of iterations
required for convergence. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the
proposed framework accelerates the parameter identification by more than 2000
times, achieves superior sample efficiency and more than 10 times higher
accuracy compared to conventional metaheuristic algorithms, particularly under
dynamic load scenarios encountered in practical applications.

TL;DR: I-OnsagerNet is a neural framework that learns dissipative stochastic dynamics from trajectory data while ensuring interpretability and uniqueness by extending the Onsager principle and enforcing Helmholtz decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complex dissipative systems operate far from equilibrium where energy dissipation and time irreversibility are key but difficult to quantify from data. Current models struggle to balance expressiveness with physical interpretability and mathematical identifiability.

Method: Extends Onsager principle to guarantee learned potential from stationary density and clean drift decomposition into time-reversible and time-irreversible components via Helmholtz decomposition. Uses neural framework to learn dynamics directly from trajectories.

Result: Enables calculation of entropy production and quantification of irreversibility. Applications reveal super-linear scaling of barrier heights and sub-linear scaling of entropy production rates with strain rate, and suppression of irreversibility with increasing batch size.

Conclusion: I-OnsagerNet establishes a general, data-driven framework for discovering and interpreting non-equilibrium dynamics with guaranteed interpretability and uniqueness.

Abstract: Complex dissipative systems appear across science and engineering, from
polymers and active matter to learning algorithms. These systems operate far
from equilibrium, where energy dissipation and time irreversibility are key to
their behavior, but are difficult to quantify from data. Learning accurate and
interpretable models of such dynamics remains a major challenge: the models
must be expressive enough to describe diverse processes, yet constrained enough
to remain physically meaningful and mathematically identifiable. Here, we
introduce I-OnsagerNet, a neural framework that learns dissipative stochastic
dynamics directly from trajectories while ensuring both interpretability and
uniqueness. I-OnsagerNet extends the Onsager principle to guarantee that the
learned potential is obtained from the stationary density and that the drift
decomposes cleanly into time-reversible and time-irreversible components, as
dictated by the Helmholtz decomposition. Our approach enables us to calculate
the entropy production and to quantify irreversibility, offering a principled
way to detect and quantify deviations from equilibrium. Applications to polymer
stretching in elongational flow and to stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics
reveal new insights, including super-linear scaling of barrier heights and
sub-linear scaling of entropy production rates with the strain rate, and the
suppression of irreversibility with increasing batch size. I-OnsagerNet thus
establishes a general, data-driven framework for discovering and interpreting
non-equilibrium dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing subtitle generation methods suffer from poor synchronization, incorrect text, inconsistent formatting, inappropriate reading speeds, and inability to adapt to dynamic contexts, requiring labor-intensive post-editing.

Method: Combines Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Image Processing, and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) to leverage contextual cues from both audio and video, with human-in-the-loop validation.

Conclusion: V-SAT provides the first comprehensive solution for robust subtitle annotation by automatically detecting and correcting a wide range of subtitle quality issues.

Abstract: The surge of audiovisual content on streaming platforms and social media has
heightened the demand for accurate and accessible subtitles. However, existing
subtitle generation methods primarily speech-based transcription or OCR-based
extraction suffer from several shortcomings, including poor synchronization,
incorrect or harmful text, inconsistent formatting, inappropriate reading

approaches often address isolated issues, leaving post-editing as a
labor-intensive and time-consuming process. In this paper, we introduce V-SAT
(Video Subtitle Annotation Tool), a unified framework that automatically
detects and corrects a wide range of subtitle quality issues. By combining
Large Language Models(LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Image Processing,
and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), V-SAT leverages contextual cues from
both audio and video. Subtitle quality improved, with the SUBER score reduced
from 9.6 to 3.54 after resolving all language mode issues and F1-scores of
~0.80 for image mode issues. Human-in-the-loop validation ensures high-quality

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPEAR++ improves the SPEAR gradient inversion attack on federated learning by making it tractable for larger batch sizes using sparsely-used dictionary learning techniques, while maintaining robustness to DP noise and FedAvg aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing gradient inversion attacks lack formal guarantees and require extensive testing for each new federated deployment. SPEAR provided theoretical foundations but was impractical due to exponential runtime in batch size.

Method: Applied State-of-the-Art techniques from Sparsely-Used Dictionary Learning to solve the gradient inversion problem on linear layers with ReLU activations, making it computationally tractable.

Result: SPEAR++ achieves 10x larger batch sizes than SPEAR while retaining all desirable properties including robustness to DP noise and FedAvg aggregation.

Conclusion: SPEAR++ successfully bridges the gap between theoretical foundations and practical applicability in gradient inversion attacks, demonstrating significant improvements in scalability while maintaining attack effectiveness.

Abstract: Federated Learning has seen an increased deployment in real-world scenarios
recently, as it enables the distributed training of machine learning models
without explicit data sharing between individual clients. Yet, the introduction
of the so-called gradient inversion attacks has fundamentally challenged its
privacy-preserving properties. Unfortunately, as these attacks mostly rely on
direct data optimization without any formal guarantees, the vulnerability of
real-world systems remains in dispute and requires tedious testing for each new
federated deployment. To overcome these issues, recently the SPEAR attack was
introduced, which is based on a theoretical analysis of the gradients of linear
layers with ReLU activations. While SPEAR is an important theoretical
breakthrough, the attack's practicality was severely limited by its exponential
runtime in the batch size b. In this work, we fill this gap by applying
State-of-the-Art techniques from Sparsely-Used Dictionary Learning to make the
problem of gradient inversion on linear layers with ReLU activations tractable.
Our experiments demonstrate that our new attack, SPEAR++, retains all desirable
properties of SPEAR, such as robustness to DP noise and FedAvg aggregation,
while being applicable to 10x bigger batch sizes.

TL;DR: SPARK is a physics-guided augmentation plugin that integrates physical parameters into a discrete state dictionary using a reconstruction autoencoder, enabling creation of physically-plausible training samples through latent space interpolation, combined with a Fourier-enhanced Graph ODE for robust prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of traditional numerical methods (high computational costs) and modern data-driven approaches (data scarcity and distribution shifts) in dynamical system modeling.

Method: Uses reconstruction autoencoder to create physics-rich discrete state dictionary, performs principled interpolation in latent space to generate new training samples, and integrates with Fourier-enhanced Graph ODE for downstream prediction.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, especially in out-of-distribution scenarios and data-scarce regimes.

Conclusion: The physics-guided augmentation paradigm proves effective for robust dynamical system modeling under data constraints and distribution shifts.

Abstract: In dynamical system modeling, traditional numerical methods are limited by
high computational costs, while modern data-driven approaches struggle with
data scarcity and distribution shifts. To address these fundamental
limitations, we first propose SPARK, a physics-guided quantitative augmentation
plugin. Specifically, SPARK utilizes a reconstruction autoencoder to integrate
physical parameters into a physics-rich discrete state dictionary. This state
dictionary then acts as a structured dictionary of physical states, enabling
the creation of new, physically-plausible training samples via principled
interpolation in the latent space. Further, for downstream prediction, these
augmented representations are seamlessly integrated with a Fourier-enhanced
Graph ODE, a combination designed to robustly model the enriched data
distribution while capturing long-term temporal dependencies. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that SPARK significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in challenging
out-of-distribution scenarios and data-scarce regimes, proving the efficacy of
our physics-guided augmentation paradigm.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper compares various time-series imputation techniques for ICU vital sign data to improve clinical prediction model performance by addressing missing data issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICU data often contains significant missing segments in vital signs that negatively impact ML prediction performance, and current practices use suboptimal imputation methods like zero imputation.

Method: The authors created an extensible benchmark with 15 imputation and 4 amputation methods for evaluating performance on major ICU datasets.

Result: The study provides a comparative analysis of established imputation techniques to identify best practices for handling missing ICU data.

Conclusion: This work aims to guide researchers in selecting optimal imputation methods and facilitate ML development for clinical practice through standardized benchmarking.

Abstract: As more Intensive Care Unit (ICU) data becomes available, the interest in
developing clinical prediction models to improve healthcare protocols
increases. However, the lack of data quality still hinders clinical prediction
using Machine Learning (ML). Many vital sign measurements, such as heart rate,
contain sizeable missing segments, leaving gaps in the data that could
negatively impact prediction performance. Previous works have introduced
numerous time-series imputation techniques. Nevertheless, more comprehensive
work is needed to compare a representative set of methods for imputing ICU
vital signs and determine the best practice. In reality, ad-hoc imputation
techniques that could decrease prediction accuracy, like zero imputation, are
still used. In this work, we compare established imputation techniques to guide
researchers in improving the performance of clinical prediction models by
selecting the most accurate imputation technique. We introduce an extensible
and reusable benchmark with currently 15 imputation and 4 amputation methods,
created for benchmarking on major ICU datasets. We hope to provide a
comparative basis and facilitate further ML development to bring more models
into clinical practice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRIVET is a sample-based privacy assessment method that detects privacy leakage in synthetic data by using extreme value statistics on nearest-neighbor distances, providing individual privacy scores for each synthetic sample.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep generative models trained on sensitive data raise privacy concerns, but existing methods only offer global, non-interpretable privacy risk estimates without sample-level assessment, hindering practical deployment of synthetic data.

Method: Uses extreme value statistics on nearest-neighbor distances to assign individual privacy leak scores to each synthetic sample, working across diverse data modalities including high-dimensional and limited-sample settings.

Result: PRIVET reliably detects memorization and privacy leakage across various data types, outperforms existing methods in controlled settings, and provides both dataset-level and sample-level assessments with qualitative and quantitative outputs.

Conclusion: The method enables practical privacy assessment for synthetic data deployment while revealing limitations in existing computer vision embeddings for identifying perceptually meaningful near-duplicate samples.

Abstract: Deep generative models are often trained on sensitive data, such as genetic
sequences, health data, or more broadly, any copyrighted, licensed or protected
content. This raises critical concerns around privacy-preserving synthetic
data, and more specifically around privacy leakage, an issue closely tied to
overfitting. Existing methods almost exclusively rely on global criteria to
estimate the risk of privacy failure associated to a model, offering only
quantitative non interpretable insights. The absence of rigorous evaluation
methods for data privacy at the sample-level may hinder the practical
deployment of synthetic data in real-world applications. Using extreme value
statistics on nearest-neighbor distances, we propose PRIVET, a generic
sample-based, modality-agnostic algorithm that assigns an individual privacy
leak score to each synthetic sample. We empirically demonstrate that PRIVET
reliably detects instances of memorization and privacy leakage across diverse
data modalities, including settings with very high dimensionality, limited
sample sizes such as genetic data and even under underfitting regimes. We
compare our method to existing approaches under controlled settings and show
its advantage in providing both dataset level and sample level assessments
through qualitative and quantitative outputs. Additionally, our analysis
reveals limitations in existing computer vision embeddings to yield
perceptually meaningful distances when identifying near-duplicate samples.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sparse Optimistic Information Directed Sampling (SOIDS), which achieves optimal worst-case regret in both data-rich and data-poor regimes for stochastic sparse linear bandits without Bayesian assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing algorithms for stochastic sparse linear bandits achieve optimal regret in either data-rich or data-poor regimes, but not both simultaneously. Sparse IDS achieves this in Bayesian settings, but there's a need for similar adaptivity in worst-case settings without Bayesian assumptions.

Method: Proposes SOIDS (Sparse Optimistic Information Directed Sampling) with a novel analysis that enables time-dependent learning rate to optimally balance information and regret.

Result: SOIDS achieves optimal worst-case regret in both data-rich and data-poor regimes simultaneously, extending IDS guarantees to worst-case settings. Empirical results demonstrate good performance.

Conclusion: SOIDS provides the first algorithm that simultaneously achieves optimal worst-case regret in both regimes for stochastic sparse linear bandits, bridging the gap between Bayesian and worst-case analysis.

Abstract: Many high-dimensional online decision-making problems can be modeled as
stochastic sparse linear bandits. Most existing algorithms are designed to
achieve optimal worst-case regret in either the data-rich regime, where
polynomial depen- dence on the ambient dimension is unavoidable, or the
data-poor regime, where dimension-independence is possible at the cost of worse
dependence on the num- ber of rounds. In contrast, the sparse Information
Directed Sampling (IDS) algo- rithm satisfies a Bayesian regret bound that has
the optimal rate in both regimes simultaneously. In this work, we explore the
use of Sparse Optimistic Informa- tion Directed Sampling (SOIDS) to achieve the
same adaptivity in the worst-case setting, without Bayesian assumptions.
Through a novel analysis that enables the use of a time-dependent learning
rate, we show that SOIDS can optimally balance information and regret. Our
results extend the theoretical guarantees of IDS, pro- viding the first
algorithm that simultaneously achieves optimal worst-case regret in both the
data-rich and data-poor regimes. We empirically demonstrate the good
performance of SOIDS.

### [168] [PaTaRM: Bridging Pairwise and Pointwise Signals via Preference-Aware Task-Adaptive Reward Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24235)
*Ai Jian,Jingqing Ruan,Xing Ma,Dailin Li,QianLin Zhou,Ke Zeng,Xunliang Cai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PaTaRM is a unified reward modeling framework that integrates preference-aware rewards with dynamic rubric adaptation, eliminating the need for explicit point-wise labels while enabling efficient and interpretable RLHF.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reward models have limitations: pair-wise methods cause mismatches for point-wise inference and require complex pairing strategies, while point-wise methods need expensive absolute labeling with poor adaptability.

Method: Proposes Preference-Aware Task-Adaptive Reward Model (PaTaRM) that uses relative preference information from pairwise data to create point-wise training signals, combined with a task-adaptive rubric system for generating evaluation criteria.

Result: Achieves 4.7% average improvement on RewardBench and RMBench across Qwen3-8B and Qwen3-14B models, and boosts downstream RLHF performance by 13.6% on IFEval and InFoBench benchmarks.

Conclusion: PaTaRM provides an efficient, generalizable, and interpretable reward modeling framework that effectively addresses limitations of current pair-wise and point-wise methods in RLHF.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are central to reinforcement learning from human feedback
(RLHF), providing the critical supervision signals that align large language
models (LLMs) with human preferences. While generative reward models (GRMs)
offer greater interpretability than traditional scalar RMs, current training
paradigms remain limited. Pair-wise methods rely on binary good-versus-bad
labels, which cause mismatches for point-wise inference and necessitate complex
pairing strategies for effective application in RLHF. On the other hand,
point-wise methods require more elaborate absolute labeling with rubric-driven
criteria, resulting in poor adaptability and high annotation costs. In this
work, we propose the Preference-Aware Task-Adaptive Reward Model (PaTaRM), a
unified framework that integrates a preference-aware reward (PAR) mechanism
with dynamic rubric adaptation. PaTaRM leverages relative preference
information from pairwise data to construct robust point-wise training signals,
eliminating the need for explicit point-wise labels. Simultaneously, it employs
a task-adaptive rubric system that flexibly generates evaluation criteria for
both global task consistency and instance-specific fine-grained reasoning. This
design enables efficient, generalizable, and interpretable reward modeling for
RLHF. Extensive experiments show that PaTaRM achieves an average relative
improvement of 4.7% on RewardBench and RMBench across Qwen3-8B and Qwen3-14B
models. Furthermore, PaTaRM boosts downstream RLHF performance, with an average
improvement of 13.6% across IFEval and InFoBench benchmarks, confirming its
effectiveness and robustness. Our code is available at

### [169] [Temporal Knowledge Graph Hyperedge Forecasting: Exploring Entity-to-Category Link Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24240)
*Edward Markai,Sina Molavipour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Extension of TLogic framework for temporal knowledge graphs that incorporates entity categories to improve accuracy and provide explainable predictions, with LLM-based category generation when categories are unknown.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most temporal knowledge graph prediction methods are embedding-based black boxes that lack transparency. This research aims to provide explainable predictions while maintaining high accuracy.

Method: Extends TLogic rule-based framework by incorporating entity categories to limit rule application to relevant entities. Uses LLM-based approach to generate categories when unknown, and investigates aggregation methods for entity score retrieval in category prediction.

Result: The approach yields high accuracy with explainable predictions, offering transparency and allowing end-users to evaluate applied rules.

Conclusion: The extended TLogic framework with entity categories provides an effective solution for temporal knowledge graph prediction that combines accuracy with explainability, addressing limitations of black-box embedding methods.

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graphs have emerged as a powerful way of not only modeling
static relationships between entities but also the dynamics of how relations
evolve over time. As these informational structures can be used to store
information from a real-world setting, such as a news flow, predicting future
graph components to a certain extent equates predicting real-world events. Most
of the research in this field focuses on embedding-based methods, often
leveraging convolutional neural net architectures. These solutions act as black
boxes, limiting insight. In this paper, we explore an extension to an
established rule-based framework, TLogic, that yields a high accuracy in
combination with explainable predictions. This offers transparency and allows
the end-user to critically evaluate the rules applied at the end of the
prediction stage. The new rule format incorporates entity category as a key
component with the purpose of limiting rule application only to relevant
entities. When categories are unknown for building the graph, we propose a
data-driven method to generate them with an LLM-based approach. Additionally,
we investigate the choice of aggregation method for scores of retrieved
entities when performing category prediction.

### [170] [SALS: Sparse Attention in Latent Space for KV cache Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24273)
*Junlin Mu,Hantao Huang,Jihang Zhang,Minghui Yu,Tao Wang,Yidong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SALS is a novel framework that compresses KV cache in LLMs by projecting it into a latent space and performing sparse token selection, avoiding the bottleneck of full reconstruction while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models with extended contexts face challenges due to large KV cache size and high memory bandwidth requirements. Existing low-rank compression methods suffer from accuracy degradation or speed bottlenecks when dealing with Rotary Position Embedding.

Method: SALS projects KV cache into a compact latent space via low-rank projection and performs sparse token selection using RoPE-free query-key interactions in this space. It reconstructs only important tokens to avoid full KV cache reconstruction overhead.

Result: SALS achieves 6.4-fold KV cache compression and 5.7-fold speed-up in attention operator compared to FlashAttention2 on 4K sequences. End-to-end throughput shows 1.4-fold and 4.5-fold improvement on 4k and 32K sequences respectively compared to GPT-fast.

Conclusion: SALS provides an effective solution for KV cache compression in LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance by maintaining competitive accuracy while significantly improving efficiency through sparse attention in latent space.

Abstract: Large Language Models capable of handling extended contexts are in high
demand, yet their inference remains challenging due to substantial Key-Value
cache size and high memory bandwidth requirements. Previous research has
demonstrated that KV cache exhibits low-rank characteristics within the hidden
dimension, suggesting the potential for effective compression. However, due to
the widely adopted Rotary Position Embedding mechanism in modern LLMs, naive
low-rank compression suffers severe accuracy degradation or creates a new speed
bottleneck, as the low-rank cache must first be reconstructed in order to apply
RoPE. In this paper, we introduce two key insights: first, the application of
RoPE to the key vectors increases their variance, which in turn results in a
higher rank; second, after the key vectors are transformed into the latent
space, they largely maintain their representation across most layers. Based on
these insights, we propose the Sparse Attention in Latent Space framework. SALS
projects the KV cache into a compact latent space via low-rank projection, and
performs sparse token selection using RoPE-free query-key interactions in this
space. By reconstructing only a small subset of important tokens, it avoids the
overhead of full KV cache reconstruction. We comprehensively evaluate SALS on
various tasks using two large-scale models: LLaMA2-7b-chat and Mistral-7b, and
additionally verify its scalability on the RULER-128k benchmark with
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct. Experimental results demonstrate that SALS achieves SOTA
performance by maintaining competitive accuracy. Under different settings, SALS
achieves 6.4-fold KV cache compression and 5.7-fold speed-up in the attention
operator compared to FlashAttention2 on the 4K sequence. For the end-to-end
throughput performance, we achieves 1.4-fold and 4.5-fold improvement compared
to GPT-fast on 4k and 32K sequences, respectively.

### [171] [EDC: Equation Discovery for Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24310)
*Guus Toussaint,Arno Knobbe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes EDC, a new equation discovery-based binary classification framework that finds analytical functions defining decision boundaries, outperforming existing ED methods and achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art classification methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend Equation Discovery techniques from regression tasks to binary classification by discovering interpretable analytical functions that specify decision boundaries.

Method: Uses a configurable grammar with summands including linear, quadratic, exponential terms, and feature products for hyperbolic curves. The framework discovers both equation structure and parameter values.

Result: Outperforms current state-of-the-art ED-based classification methods and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art binary classification methods on artificial and real-life datasets.

Conclusion: EDC successfully discovers both equation structure and parameters for decision boundaries, with a flexible but not overly complex grammar that prevents overfitting while capturing XOR-like dependencies.

Abstract: Equation Discovery techniques have shown considerable success in regression
tasks, where they are used to discover concise and interpretable models
(\textit{Symbolic Regression}). In this paper, we propose a new ED-based binary
classification framework. Our proposed method EDC finds analytical functions of
manageable size that specify the location and shape of the decision boundary.
In extensive experiments on artificial and real-life data, we demonstrate how
EDC is able to discover both the structure of the target equation as well as
the value of its parameters, outperforming the current state-of-the-art
ED-based classification methods in binary classification and achieving
performance comparable to the state of the art in binary classification. We
suggest a grammar of modest complexity that appears to work well on the tested
datasets but argue that the exact grammar -- and thus the complexity of the
models -- is configurable, and especially domain-specific expressions can be
included in the pattern language, where that is required. The presented grammar
consists of a series of summands (additive terms) that include linear,
quadratic and exponential terms, as well as products of two features (producing
hyperbolic curves ideal for capturing XOR-like dependencies). The experiments
demonstrate that this grammar allows fairly flexible decision boundaries while
not so rich to cause overfitting.

### [172] [Transformers can do Bayesian Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24318)
*Prajit Bhaskaran,Tom Viering*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Cluster-PFN is a Transformer-based model for Bayesian clustering that learns from synthetic GMM data to estimate posterior distributions over cluster counts and assignments, handling missing data effectively and outperforming traditional methods in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian clustering is computationally intensive at scale, and real-world datasets often have missing values that simple imputation methods handle poorly, leading to suboptimal clustering results.

Method: Cluster-PFN extends Prior-Data Fitted Networks using Transformers, trained entirely on synthetic datasets from Gaussian Mixture Model priors to estimate posterior distributions over cluster numbers and assignments, including handling missing data.

Result: Cluster-PFN estimates cluster numbers more accurately than AIC, BIC, and Variational Inference, achieves competitive clustering quality with VI while being orders of magnitude faster, and outperforms imputation-based methods on real-world genomic datasets with high missingness.

Conclusion: Cluster-PFN provides scalable and flexible Bayesian clustering that effectively handles missing data and computational challenges of traditional Bayesian methods.

Abstract: Bayesian clustering accounts for uncertainty but is computationally demanding
at scale. Furthermore, real-world datasets often contain missing values, and
simple imputation ignores the associated uncertainty, resulting in suboptimal
results. We present Cluster-PFN, a Transformer-based model that extends
Prior-Data Fitted Networks (PFNs) to unsupervised Bayesian clustering. Trained
entirely on synthetic datasets generated from a finite Gaussian Mixture Model
(GMM) prior, Cluster-PFN learns to estimate the posterior distribution over
both the number of clusters and the cluster assignments. Our method estimates
the number of clusters more accurately than handcrafted model selection
procedures such as AIC, BIC and Variational Inference (VI), and achieves
clustering quality competitive with VI while being orders of magnitude faster.
Cluster-PFN can be trained on complex priors that include missing data,
outperforming imputation-based baselines on real-world genomic datasets, at
high missingness. These results show that the Cluster-PFN can provide scalable
and flexible Bayesian clustering.

### [173] [Perception Learning: A Formal Separation of Sensory Representation Learning from Decision Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24356)
*Suman Sanyal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Perception Learning (PeL) is a paradigm that optimizes sensory interfaces using task-agnostic signals, separate from decision learning, focusing on perceptual properties like stability, informativeness, and controlled geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To decouple perception learning from decision learning, enabling optimization of sensory interfaces based on intrinsic perceptual properties rather than task-specific objectives.

Method: Formalizes separation of perception and decision, defines perceptual properties independent of objectives, proves orthogonal updates to Bayes task-risk gradients, and provides task-agnostic evaluation metrics.

Result: Theoretical framework for perception learning with proofs about update orthogonality and development of representation-invariant metrics for perceptual quality assessment.

Conclusion: PeL enables task-agnostic optimization of sensory interfaces, providing a foundation for certified perceptual quality independent of downstream decision tasks.

Abstract: We introduce Perception Learning (PeL), a paradigm that optimizes an agent's
sensory interface $f_\phi:\mathcal{X}\to\mathcal{Z}$ using task-agnostic
signals, decoupled from downstream decision learning
$g_\theta:\mathcal{Z}\to\mathcal{Y}$. PeL directly targets label-free
perceptual properties, such as stability to nuisances, informativeness without
collapse, and controlled geometry, assessed via objective
representation-invariant metrics. We formalize the separation of perception and
decision, define perceptual properties independent of objectives or
reparameterizations, and prove that PeL updates preserving sufficient
invariants are orthogonal to Bayes task-risk gradients. Additionally, we
provide a suite of task-agnostic evaluation metrics to certify perceptual
quality.

*Maria Gabriela Valeriano,David Kohan Marzagão,Alfredo Montelongo,Carlos Roberto Veiga Kiffer,Natan Katz,Ana Carolina Lorena*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A two-step data-centric approach using Instance Hardness filtering and confidence-based rejection to improve ML model reliability in healthcare applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ML models in healthcare often fail to account for uncertainty and provide low-confidence predictions, which is problematic for high-stakes domains where reliability is critical.

Method: Two-step approach: 1) Use Instance Hardness (IH) to filter problematic instances during training to refine datasets; 2) Implement confidence-based rejection mechanism during inference to retain only reliable predictions.

Result: Evaluated on three real-world healthcare datasets, the approach effectively improves model reliability while balancing predictive performance and rejection rate. IH filtering with confidence-based rejection outperforms baseline methods using influence values and uncertainty.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a practical solution for deploying ML systems in safety-critical applications by enhancing model performance while preserving most instances.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models are widely used in high-stakes domains such as
healthcare, where the reliability of predictions is critical. However, these
models often fail to account for uncertainty, providing predictions even with
low confidence. This work proposes a novel two-step data-centric approach to
enhance the performance of ML models by improving data quality and filtering
low-confidence predictions. The first step involves leveraging Instance
Hardness (IH) to filter problematic instances during training, thereby refining
the dataset. The second step introduces a confidence-based rejection mechanism
during inference, ensuring that only reliable predictions are retained. We
evaluate our approach using three real-world healthcare datasets, demonstrating
its effectiveness at improving model reliability while balancing predictive
performance and rejection rate. Additionally, we use alternative criteria -
influence values for filtering and uncertainty for rejection - as baselines to
evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that
integrating IH filtering with confidence-based rejection effectively enhances
model performance while preserving a large proportion of instances. This
approach provides a practical method for deploying ML systems in
safety-critical applications.

*Yuanyuan Wu,Zhenlin Qin,Zhenliang Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a Representativeness-Privacy-Utility (RPU) framework to systematically evaluate synthetic trip data across three dimensions and hierarchical levels, benchmarking 12 generation methods and finding CTGAN provides the most balanced trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic data addresses privacy and accessibility challenges in smart card data for public transport research, but existing evaluations are fragmented and limited, lacking comprehensive assessment of reliability, safety, and usefulness.

Method: Developed a RPU framework evaluating synthetic trip data across representativeness, privacy, and utility dimensions at record, group, and population levels, using consistent metrics to quantify similarity, disclosure risk, and practical usefulness.

Result: Benchmarked 12 generation methods showing synthetic data doesn't inherently guarantee privacy, no "one-size-fits-all" model exists, and trade-offs between privacy and representativeness/utility are obvious. CTGAN provides the most balanced trade-off.

Conclusion: The RPU framework provides a systematic, reproducible basis for researchers and practitioners to compare synthetic data generation techniques and select appropriate methods in public transport applications.

Abstract: Synthetic data offers a promising solution to the privacy and accessibility
challenges of using smart card data in public transport research. Despite rapid
progress in generative modeling, there is limited attention to comprehensive
evaluation, leaving unclear how reliable, safe, and useful synthetic data truly
are. Existing evaluations remain fragmented, typically limited to
population-level representativeness or record-level privacy, without
considering group-level variations or task-specific utility. To address this
gap, we propose a Representativeness-Privacy-Utility (RPU) framework that
systematically evaluates synthetic trip data across three complementary
dimensions and three hierarchical levels (record, group, population). The
framework integrates a consistent set of metrics to quantify similarity,
disclosure risk, and practical usefulness, enabling transparent and balanced
assessment of synthetic data quality. We apply the framework to benchmark
twelve representative generation methods, spanning conventional statistical
models, deep generative networks, and privacy-enhanced variants. Results show
that synthetic data do not inherently guarantee privacy and there is no
"one-size-fits-all" model, the trade-off between privacy and
representativeness/utility is obvious. Conditional Tabular generative
adversarial network (CTGAN) provide the most balanced trade-off and is
suggested for practical applications. The RPU framework provides a systematic
and reproducible basis for researchers and practitioners to compare synthetic
data generation techniques and select appropriate methods in public transport
applications.

*Aryan Pedawi,Jordi Silvestre-Ryan,Bradley Worley,Darren J Hsu,Kushal S Shah,Elias Stehle,Jingrong Zhang,Izhar Wallach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: APEX is a neural network-based virtual screening protocol that enables approximate-but-exhaustive search of combinatorial synthesis libraries in under a minute using consumer GPUs, addressing the challenge of screening massive compound libraries with limited computational budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current combinatorial synthesis libraries contain tens of billions of compounds, but virtual screening campaigns can only evaluate <0.1% due to computational constraints, leaving many high-scoring compounds undiscovered. Existing methods lack amortization when objectives and constraints change during campaigns.

Method: APEX uses a neural network surrogate that exploits the structure of combinatorial synthesis libraries to predict objectives and constraints, enabling full enumeration on consumer GPUs in under a minute for exact retrieval of approximate top-k sets.

Result: APEX demonstrates consistently strong performance in both retrieval accuracy and runtime compared to alternative methods, as validated on a benchmark CSL of over 10 million compounds with docking scores on five medically relevant targets and physicochemical properties.

Conclusion: APEX provides an efficient solution for virtual screening of massive combinatorial libraries by enabling approximate-but-exhaustive search with neural network surrogates, overcoming computational limitations of traditional methods while maintaining high retrieval accuracy.

Abstract: Make-on-demand combinatorial synthesis libraries (CSLs) like Enamine REAL
have significantly enabled drug discovery efforts. However, their large size
presents a challenge for virtual screening, where the goal is to identify the
top compounds in a library according to a computational objective (e.g.,
optimizing docking score) subject to computational constraints under a limited
computational budget. For current library sizes -- numbering in the tens of
billions of compounds -- and scoring functions of interest, a routine virtual
screening campaign may be limited to scoring fewer than 0.1% of the available
compounds, leaving potentially many high scoring compounds undiscovered.
Furthermore, as constraints (and sometimes objectives) change during the course
of a virtual screening campaign, existing virtual screening algorithms
typically offer little room for amortization. We propose the
approximate-but-exhaustive search protocol for CSLs, or APEX. APEX utilizes a
neural network surrogate that exploits the structure of CSLs in the prediction
of objectives and constraints to make full enumeration on a consumer GPU
possible in under a minute, allowing for exact retrieval of approximate top-$k$
sets. To demonstrate APEX's capabilities, we develop a benchmark CSL comprised
of more than 10 million compounds, all of which have been annotated with their
docking scores on five medically relevant targets along with physicohemical
properties measured with RDKit such that, for any objective and set of
constraints, the ground truth top-$k$ compounds can be identified and compared
against the retrievals from any virtual screening algorithm. We show APEX's
consistently strong performance both in retrieval accuracy and runtime compared
to alternative methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning in sparse-reward environments is challenging due to lack of informative feedback, requiring extensive exploration.

Method: Use a small number of successful demonstrations to precompute value estimates and initialize the RL agent's value function, then refine through standard online interaction.

Result: Significantly reduces exploration burden, improves sample efficiency, accelerates convergence, and outperforms standard baselines even with minimal or suboptimal demonstrations.

Conclusion: The hybrid offline-to-online paradigm with demonstration-based value initialization is effective for sparse-reward RL tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in sparse-reward environments remains a
significant challenge due to the lack of informative feedback. We propose a
simple yet effective method that uses a small number of successful
demonstrations to initialize the value function of an RL agent. By precomputing
value estimates from offline demonstrations and using them as targets for early
learning, our approach provides the agent with a useful prior over promising
actions. The agent then refines these estimates through standard online
interaction. This hybrid offline-to-online paradigm significantly reduces the
exploration burden and improves sample efficiency in sparse-reward settings.
Experiments on benchmark tasks demonstrate that our method accelerates
convergence and outperforms standard baselines, even with minimal or suboptimal
demonstration data.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential and applicability of machine learning survival analysis models to improve survival prediction and support clinical decision making for colorectal cancer patients.

Abstract: This study presents a comparative methodological analysis of six machine

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most RL algorithms are designed for discrete-time dynamics, but real-world control systems are continuous in time. There's a need for RL methods that can handle continuous-time dynamics represented by nonlinear ODEs.

Method: Leverages probabilistic models (Gaussian processes and Bayesian neural networks) to learn uncertainty-aware ODE models. Uses COMBRL algorithm that greedily maximizes weighted sum of extrinsic reward and model epistemic uncertainty.

Result: COMBRL achieves sublinear regret in reward-driven settings and provides sample complexity bounds in unsupervised RL. Experiments show it scales better, is more sample-efficient than prior methods, and outperforms baselines across deep RL tasks.

Conclusion: COMBRL provides a scalable and sample-efficient approach to continuous-time model-based RL that works effectively in both standard and unsupervised RL settings.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms are typically designed for discrete-time
dynamics, even though the underlying real-world control systems are often
continuous in time. In this paper, we study the problem of continuous-time
reinforcement learning, where the unknown system dynamics are represented using
nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We leverage probabilistic
models, such as Gaussian processes and Bayesian neural networks, to learn an
uncertainty-aware model of the underlying ODE. Our algorithm, COMBRL, greedily
maximizes a weighted sum of the extrinsic reward and model epistemic
uncertainty. This yields a scalable and sample-efficient approach to
continuous-time model-based RL. We show that COMBRL achieves sublinear regret
in the reward-driven setting, and in the unsupervised RL setting (i.e., without
extrinsic rewards), we provide a sample complexity bound. In our experiments,
we evaluate COMBRL in both standard and unsupervised RL settings and
demonstrate that it scales better, is more sample-efficient than prior methods,
and outperforms baselines across several deep RL tasks.

TL;DR: This paper proposes LoRA-DA, a data-aware initialization method for LoRA fine-tuning that improves accuracy and convergence through a theoretical framework combining bias and variance optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA initialization methods either ignore target-domain data or use shallow gradient-based approaches with weak empirical performance and limited theoretical foundations.

Method: Developed a theoretical framework using asymptotic analysis to derive an optimal initialization strategy that minimizes parameter discrepancy, combining bias (Fisher-gradient formulation) and variance (Fisher information) terms. Implemented as LoRA-DA algorithm that estimates these terms from target domain samples.

Result: LoRA-DA consistently improves final accuracy across multiple benchmarks, shows faster and more stable convergence, robustness across ranks, with only small initialization overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed data-aware LoRA initialization method provides both theoretical foundation and practical effectiveness, outperforming existing approaches while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of LLMs, LoRA has become a dominant method for
PEFT, and its initialization methods have attracted increasing attention.
However, existing methods have notable limitations: many methods do not
incorporate target-domain data, while gradient-based methods exploit data only
at a shallow level by relying on one-step gradient decomposition, which remains
unsatisfactory due to the weak empirical performance of the one-step
fine-tuning model that serves as their basis, as well as the fact that these
methods either lack a rigorous theoretical foundation or depend heavily on
restrictive isotropic assumptions. In this paper, we establish a theoretical
framework for data-aware LoRA initialization based on asymptotic analysis.
Starting from a general optimization objective that minimizes the expectation
of the parameter discrepancy between the fine-tuned and target models, we
derive an optimization problem with two components: a bias term, which is
related to the parameter distance between the fine-tuned and target models, and
is approximated using a Fisher-gradient formulation to preserve anisotropy; and
a variance term, which accounts for the uncertainty introduced by sampling
stochasticity through the Fisher information. By solving this problem, we
obtain an optimal initialization strategy for LoRA. Building on this
theoretical framework, we develop an efficient algorithm, LoRA-DA, which
estimates the terms in the optimization problem from a small set of target
domain samples and obtains the optimal LoRA initialization. Empirical results
across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LoRA-DA consistently improves final
accuracy over existing initialization methods. Additional studies show faster,
more stable convergence, robustness across ranks, and only a small
initialization overhead for LoRA-DA. The source code will be released upon
publication.

TL;DR: DistDF improves time-series forecasting by minimizing a joint-distribution Wasserstein discrepancy instead of biased conditional negative log-likelihood estimation, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard direct forecast approaches suffer from biased estimation due to label autocorrelation when minimizing conditional negative log-likelihood.

Method: Proposes DistDF that minimizes a joint-distribution Wasserstein discrepancy which upper bounds the conditional discrepancy, providing tractable and differentiable estimation from empirical samples.

Result: Extensive experiments show DistDF improves diverse forecast models and achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance.

Conclusion: DistDF provides a more effective approach for aligning forecast distributions with label sequences in time-series forecasting.

Abstract: Training time-series forecast models requires aligning the conditional
distribution of model forecasts with that of the label sequence. The standard
direct forecast (DF) approach resorts to minimize the conditional negative
log-likelihood of the label sequence, typically estimated using the mean
squared error. However, this estimation proves to be biased in the presence of
label autocorrelation. In this paper, we propose DistDF, which achieves
alignment by alternatively minimizing a discrepancy between the conditional
forecast and label distributions. Because conditional discrepancies are
difficult to estimate from finite time-series observations, we introduce a
newly proposed joint-distribution Wasserstein discrepancy for time-series
forecasting, which provably upper bounds the conditional discrepancy of
interest. This discrepancy admits tractable, differentiable estimation from
empirical samples and integrates seamlessly with gradient-based training.
Extensive experiments show that DistDF improves the performance diverse
forecast models and achieves the state-of-the-art forecasting performance. Code

Conclusion: Demonstrates potential of combining quantum-inspired methods with classical architectures for lightweight, high-performance, and interpretable predictive models, advancing QML applicability.

Abstract: Current quantum machine learning approaches often face challenges balancing
predictive accuracy, robustness, and interpretability. To address this, we
propose a novel quantum adversarial framework that integrates a hybrid quantum
neural network (QNN) with classical deep learning layers, guided by an
evaluator model with LIME-based interpretability, and extended through quantum
GAN and self-supervised variants. In the proposed model, an adversarial
evaluator concurrently guides the QNN by computing feedback loss, thereby
optimizing both prediction accuracy and model explainability. Empirical
evaluations show that the Vanilla model achieves RMSE = 0.27, MSE = 0.071, MAE
= 0.21, and R^2 = 0.59, delivering the most consistent performance across
regression metrics compared to adversarial counterparts. These results
demonstrate the potential of combining quantum-inspired methods with classical
architectures to develop lightweight, high-performance, and interpretable
predictive models, advancing the applicability of QML beyond current

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ILP methods learn a single hypothesis per training run, while ensemble methods require multiple training runs. This approach aims to get ensemble benefits with only one training run.

Method: Train ILP algorithm once while saving intermediate hypotheses, then combine them using minimum description length weighting scheme.

Result: Experiments on multiple benchmarks (game playing and visual reasoning) show 4% predictive accuracy improvement with less than 1% computational overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed single-training ensemble approach effectively improves ILP performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Inductive logic programming (ILP) is a form of logical machine learning. Most
ILP algorithms learn a single hypothesis from a single training run. Ensemble
methods train an ILP algorithm multiple times to learn multiple hypotheses. In
this paper, we train an ILP algorithm only once and save intermediate
hypotheses. We then combine the hypotheses using a minimum description length

*Pedro P. Sanchez,Damian Machlanski,Steven McDonagh,Sotirios A. Tsaftaris*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DOTS (Diffusion Ordered Temporal Structure) is a novel causal discovery method for time series that uses multiple causal orderings instead of a single one, improving accuracy and scalability while reducing runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ordering-based causal discovery methods have limited representational capacity due to using only a single causal ordering, which can lead to spurious artifacts and poor performance as the number of variables and time points grow.

Method: DOTS leverages multiple valid causal orderings and uses diffusion-based causal discovery with score matching and efficient Hessian estimation under standard assumptions like stationarity and additive noise models.

Result: DOTS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, improving mean window-graph F1 from 0.63 to 0.81 on synthetic benchmarks and achieving the highest average summary-graph F1 on real-world CausalTime benchmark while halving runtime compared to graph-optimisation methods.

Conclusion: DOTS establishes itself as a scalable and accurate solution for temporal causal discovery by effectively recovering the transitive closure of the underlying directed acyclic graph through multiple orderings.

Abstract: Predicting causal structure from time series data is crucial for
understanding complex phenomena in physiology, brain connectivity, climate
dynamics, and socio-economic behaviour. Causal discovery in time series is
hindered by the combinatorial complexity of identifying true causal
relationships, especially as the number of variables and time points grow. A
common approach to simplify the task is the so-called ordering-based methods.
Traditional ordering methods inherently limit the representational capacity of
the resulting model. In this work, we fix this issue by leveraging multiple
valid causal orderings, instead of a single one as standard practice. We
propose DOTS (Diffusion Ordered Temporal Structure), using diffusion-based
causal discovery for temporal data. By integrating multiple orderings, DOTS
effectively recovers the transitive closure of the underlying directed acyclic
graph, mitigating spurious artifacts inherent in single-ordering approaches. We
formalise the problem under standard assumptions such as stationarity and the
additive noise model, and leverage score matching with diffusion processes to
enable efficient Hessian estimation. Extensive experiments validate the
approach. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that DOTS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a
scalable and robust approach to temporal causal discovery. On synthetic
benchmarks ($d{=}\!3-\!6$ variables, $T{=}200\!-\!5{,}000$ samples), DOTS
improves mean window-graph $F1$ from $0.63$ (best baseline) to $0.81$. On the
CausalTime real-world benchmark ($d{=}20\!-\!36$), while baselines remain the
best on individual datasets, DOTS attains the highest average summary-graph
$F1$ while halving runtime relative to graph-optimisation methods. These
results establish DOTS as a scalable and accurate solution for temporal causal
discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes parameter complexity for robust memorization in ReLU networks, establishing upper and lower bounds that depend on the robustness ratio ρ = μ/ε, showing complexity matches non-robust memorization for small ρ but grows with increasing ρ.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how many parameters are needed for ReLU networks to memorize datasets while ensuring robustness - maintaining consistent predictions within μ-balls around training samples with ε-separation between differently labeled points.

Method: Established upper and lower bounds on parameter count as a function of robustness ratio ρ = μ/ε, providing fine-grained analysis across the entire range ρ ∈ (0,1) with tighter bounds than prior work.

Result: Parameter complexity of robust memorization matches non-robust memorization when ρ is small, but grows with increasing ρ, with improved upper and lower bounds over existing results.

Conclusion: The study provides comprehensive understanding of parameter requirements for robust memorization in ReLU networks, revealing the trade-off between robustness and parameter efficiency across different robustness regimes.

Abstract: We study the parameter complexity of robust memorization for $\mathrm{ReLU}$
networks: the number of parameters required to interpolate any given dataset
with $\epsilon$-separation between differently labeled points, while ensuring
predictions remain consistent within a $\mu$-ball around each training sample.
We establish upper and lower bounds on the parameter count as a function of the
robustness ratio $\rho = \mu / \epsilon$. Unlike prior work, we provide a
fine-grained analysis across the entire range $\rho \in (0,1)$ and obtain
tighter upper and lower bounds that improve upon existing results. Our findings
reveal that the parameter complexity of robust memorization matches that of
non-robust memorization when $\rho$ is small, but grows with increasing $\rho$.

TL;DR: Pearl is a foundation model for protein-ligand cofolding that achieves state-of-the-art performance through large-scale synthetic data training, SO(3)-equivariant diffusion architecture, and controllable inference capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for protein-ligand structure prediction are limited by scarce experimental data, inefficient architectures, physically invalid poses, and inability to exploit auxiliary information at inference.

Method: Pearl uses three key innovations: (1) large-scale synthetic data training to overcome data scarcity, (2) SO(3)-equivariant diffusion module to respect 3D rotational symmetries, and (3) controllable inference with multi-chain templating and dual unconditional/conditional modes.

Result: Pearl surpasses AlphaFold 3 and other baselines, achieving 14.5% and 14.2% improvements on public benchmarks for accurate (RMSD < 2Å) and physically valid poses. It also delivers 3.6× improvement on challenging drug targets at RMSD < 1Å threshold.

Conclusion: Pearl establishes new state-of-the-art in protein-ligand cofolding, with performance directly correlating with synthetic dataset size used in training.

Abstract: Accurately predicting the three-dimensional structures of protein-ligand
complexes remains a fundamental challenge in computational drug discovery that
limits the pace and success of therapeutic design. Deep learning methods have
recently shown strong potential as structural prediction tools, achieving
promising accuracy across diverse biomolecular systems. However, their
performance and utility are constrained by scarce experimental data,
inefficient architectures, physically invalid poses, and the limited ability to
exploit auxiliary information available at inference. To address these issues,
we introduce Pearl (Placing Every Atom in the Right Location), a foundation
model for protein-ligand cofolding at scale. Pearl addresses these challenges
with three key innovations: (1) training recipes that include large-scale
synthetic data to overcome data scarcity; (2) architectures that incorporate an
SO(3)-equivariant diffusion module to inherently respect 3D rotational
symmetries, improving generalization and sample efficiency, and (3)
controllable inference, including a generalized multi-chain templating system
supporting both protein and non-polymeric components as well as dual
unconditional/conditional modes. Pearl establishes a new state-of-the-art
performance in protein-ligand cofolding. On the key metric of generating
accurate (RMSD < 2 \r{A}) and physically valid poses, Pearl surpasses AlphaFold
3 and other open source baselines on the public Runs N' Poses and PoseBusters
benchmarks, delivering 14.5% and 14.2% improvements, respectively, over the
next best model. In the pocket-conditional cofolding regime, Pearl delivers
$3.6\times$ improvement on a proprietary set of challenging, real-world drug
targets at the more rigorous RMSD < 1 \r{A} threshold. Finally, we demonstrate
that model performance correlates directly with synthetic dataset size used in
training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for extracting ordered and identifiable eigenfunctions from contextual kernels, addressing limitations of existing methods that only recover linear spans of top eigenfunctions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing representation learning methods (contrastive and non-contrastive) only recover the linear span of top eigenfunctions of contextual kernels, while exact spectral decomposition is essential for understanding feature ordering and importance.

Method: A general framework using modular building blocks designed to satisfy key desiderata (compatibility with contextual kernel, scalability), with two methodological paradigms: low-rank approximation and Rayleigh quotient optimization for eigenfunction extraction.

Result: Validated on synthetic kernels and real-world image datasets, showing that recovered eigenvalues act as effective importance scores for feature selection, enabling principled efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs via adaptive-dimensional representations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully extracts ordered and identifiable eigenfunctions, providing better understanding of feature importance and enabling adaptive representation dimensionality for efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs.

Abstract: Recent advances in representation learning reveal that widely used
objectives, such as contrastive and non-contrastive, implicitly perform
spectral decomposition of a contextual kernel, induced by the relationship
between inputs and their contexts. Yet, these methods recover only the linear
span of top eigenfunctions of the kernel, whereas exact spectral decomposition
is essential for understanding feature ordering and importance. In this work,
we propose a general framework to extract ordered and identifiable
eigenfunctions, based on modular building blocks designed to satisfy key
desiderata, including compatibility with the contextual kernel and scalability
to modern settings. We then show how two main methodological paradigms,
low-rank approximation and Rayleigh quotient optimization, align with this
framework for eigenfunction extraction. Finally, we validate our approach on
synthetic kernels and demonstrate on real-world image datasets that the
recovered eigenvalues act as effective importance scores for feature selection,
enabling principled efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs via adaptive-dimensional
representations.

TL;DR: This paper applies the options framework to autonomous driving on highways, defining dedicated options for longitudinal and lateral maneuvers with safety and comfort constraints, and shows that policies over hybrid options outperform baseline approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few deep reinforcement learning approaches for autonomous driving use the options framework, despite its natural suitability for hierarchical control applications like autonomous driving tasks.

Method: Define dedicated options for longitudinal and lateral maneuvers with embedded safety and comfort constraints, propose hierarchical control setups with options, and derive practical algorithms using state-of-the-art reinforcement learning techniques.

Result: Policies over combined and hybrid options achieve the same expressiveness and flexibility as human drivers while being more interpretable than classical policies over continuous actions. Flexible policies over hybrid options perform best under varying traffic conditions.

Conclusion: The options framework is well-suited for autonomous driving tasks, with hybrid option policies outperforming baseline approaches and providing interpretable, flexible control similar to human driving behavior.

Abstract: Out of the many deep reinforcement learning approaches for autonomous
driving, only few make use of the options (or skills) framework. That is
surprising, as this framework is naturally suited for hierarchical control
applications in general, and autonomous driving tasks in specific. Therefore,
in this work the options framework is applied and tailored to autonomous
driving tasks on highways. More specifically, we define dedicated options for
longitudinal and lateral manoeuvres with embedded safety and comfort
constraints. This way, prior domain knowledge can be incorporated into the
learning process and the learned driving behaviour can be constrained more
easily. We propose several setups for hierarchical control with options and
derive practical algorithms following state-of-the-art reinforcement learning
techniques. By separately selecting actions for longitudinal and lateral
control, the introduced policies over combined and hybrid options obtain the
same expressiveness and flexibility that human drivers have, while being easier
to interpret than classical policies over continuous actions. Of all the
investigated approaches, these flexible policies over hybrid options perform
the best under varying traffic conditions, outperforming the baseline policies
over actions.

TL;DR: Proposes nonlinear stacked intelligent surfaces (SIS) that mimic neural network behavior, showing improved communication reliability over linear SIS through complex signal pattern formation and higher noise diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of linear SIS operations and unlock further potential by enabling nonlinear transformations similar to neural networks for enhanced wireless communication performance.

Method: Developed a nonlinear SIS unit cell with step-like response, optimized SIS structures to minimize symbol error rate in MIMO systems using statistical channel information, with SIS deployed at both transmitter and receiver.

Result: Nonlinear SIS improves communication reliability compared to linear SIS by forming complex signal patterns that provide higher diversity against noise disturbances while remaining discernible to receivers.

Conclusion: Nonlinear SIS represents a promising advancement over linear SIS, enabling neural network-like behavior for enhanced wireless communication with potential applications across various scenarios.

Abstract: Stacked intelligent surfaces (SIS) are a promising technology for
next-generation wireless systems, offering an opportunity to enhance
communication performance with low power consumption. Typically, an SIS is
modelled as a surface that imparts phase shifts on impinging electromagnetic
signals to achieve desired communication objectives. However, this mode of
operation results in a linear SIS, which limits its applicability to linear
operations. To unlock further SIS potential, we propose a nonlinear SIS that
can mimic the behaviour of nonlinear neural networks. We discuss the
feasibility and potential of this idea and propose a nonlinear SIS unit cell
with a step-like response. To evaluate the system-level performance of
nonlinear SIS, we present a case study where SIS structures are optimized to
minimize the symbol error rate (SER) in an MIMO system with SIS deployed at
both the transmitter and receiver sides using only statistical channel
information. We demonstrate that a nonlinear SIS can improve communication
reliability compared to a linear SIS by forming complex signal patterns across
the SIS surface, which provide higher diversity against noise disturbances,
while still allowing the receiver to discern these patterns. Finally, we
outline several potential applications of nonlinear SIS in wireless
communication scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a physics-informed prediction framework using OTFS modulation to improve CSI feedback for MIMO systems in high-mobility scenarios like VANETs and FANETs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional time-frequency CSI feedback schemes struggle with rapidly fluctuating channel conditions in high-mobility environments, motivating the shift to more stable delay-Doppler representations like OTFS modulation.

Method: Derived an expression for OTFS I/O relationship variation over time, then created a physics-informed complex exponential basis expansion model prediction framework that maximizes outdated CSI usefulness for integer and fractional delay-Doppler channels.

Result: The framework facilitates high mobility MIMO communication by effectively handling outdated Channel State Information in challenging mobile environments.

Conclusion: The proposed OTFS-based prediction framework enables reliable MIMO communication in high-mobility scenarios where traditional CSI feedback methods fail.

Abstract: As 6G technologies advance, international bodies and regulatory agencies are
intensifying efforts to extend seamless connectivity especially for
high-mobility scenarios such as Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (\textit{MANETs}) types
such as Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (\textit{VANETs}) and Flying Ad-Hoc Networks
(\textit{FANETs}). For these environments to be considered for long term
adoption and use they must support Multiple-Input-Multiple- (MIMO) technology,
rapidly fluctuating channel conditions in these environments place a heavy
burden on traditional time-frequency CSI feedback schemes required for MIMO
precoding. This motivates a shift toward delay-Doppler representations like
those employed by Orthogonal Time-Frequency Space(OTFS) modulation, which
offers greater stability under mobility. We derive an expression for the
variation over time in the OTFS I/O relationship. We then use this to create a
physics informed complex exponential basis expansion model prediction framework
that maximizes the usefulness of outdated Channel State Information (CSI) in
the presence of integer and fractional delay-Doppler channels and facilitates
high mobility MIMO communication.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a gradient-based meta-learning approach to optimize CoMP transmission with pinching antenna systems, achieving 92% of optimal performance and higher rate upper bounds than conventional systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CoMP systems with uniform linear arrays suffer from upper-bound rate limitations, and pinching antenna technology can overcome large-scale fading in MIMO systems.

Method: A gradient-based meta-learning strategy is used to jointly optimize transmit beamforming vectors and pinching locations on waveguides while respecting QoS requirements.

Result: The proposed approach achieves 92% of the optimal solution and demonstrates superiority over benchmarks, with higher achievable rate upper bounds compared to conventional CoMP systems.

Conclusion: The GML-based optimization effectively addresses the non-convex problem in CoMP-PASS systems, providing significant performance improvements over traditional approaches.

Abstract: We study a coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission where two base
stations (BSs), each supported by a pinching antenna system (PASS), are
deployed to jointly serve communication users under spatial division multiple
access (SDMA) technology. Pinching Antenna technology was introduced as a
promising solution to overcome the large-scale fading that has been shown to be
an impediment in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. To realize the
advantages of this technology in CoMP systems, which suffer from an upperbound
rate limitation when traditional uniform linear arrays (ULAs) are adopted, we
formulate an optimization problem with the aim of maximizing the achievable sum
rate by jointly determining the transmit beamforming vectors and pinching
locations on the waveguides while respecting the quality of service (QoS)
requirements of users. This problem is inherently non-convex due to the strong
coupling among its decision parameters, making it challenging to solve using
traditional optimization methods. Thus, we utilize a gradient-based
meta-learning (GML) strategy specifically designed for large-scale optimization
tasks. Finally, numerical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the
proposed GML approach, achieving 92 percent of the optimal solution, and the
superiority of the solution presented compared to other benchmarks. In
addition, it achieves a higher upper bound on the achievable rate compared to
conventional CoMP systems.

TL;DR: The paper presents a series characteristic function method for efficiently predicting nonlinear distortion spectra in sparse multi-carrier transmissions, validated both theoretically and practically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nonlinearities in power amplifiers adversely affect multi-carrier modulation techniques, and accurate prediction of nonlinear distortion is essential for design trade-offs between output power and network throughput.

Method: Uses the series form of the characteristic function method to predict distortion spectra, expressing nonlinearity as FFT of S21 parameters or transconductance functions, with distortion contributions as numerical autoconvolutions of the clean spectrum.

Result: Method produces efficient calculations of signal and distortion components, validated theoretically against Price's theorem and practically with OFDM signals in compressed amplifiers, showing good agreement with laboratory measurements.

Conclusion: The series characteristic function method provides computationally efficient prediction of nonlinear distortion, enabling easy computation of signal-to-distortion ratio across variables like overdrive level.

Abstract: Nonlinearities in power amplifiers adversely affect multi-carrier modulation
techniques. Accurate prediction of nonlinear distortion is essential for making
design trade-offs between output power and network throughput. We use the
series form of the characteristic function (ch.f.) method to predict distortion
spectra for sparse multi-carrier transmissions. This method results in
efficient calculations of individual signal and distortion components. The
method is validated both theoretically and practically. Theoretical validation
is performed by modeling the signal as a bandpass Gaussian process that is hard
limited, and it is shown that the series ch.f. method produces results that are
identical with the classical Price's theorem. Practical validation is shown by
considering an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal with a
fragmented spectrum which is then applied to an amplifier driven into
compression for which application of Price's theorem is difficult, and the
predicted output spectrum corroborates laboratory measurements. Part of the
computational efficiency is realized in that the nonlinearity can be expressed
as the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of samples of its forward scattering
parameter (i.e., S21) or transconductance function (including AM-PM effects),
and distortion contributions of the signal can be expressed as numerical
autoconvolutions of the clean spectrum. Signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) can be
easily computed and parameterized across variables of interest, such as
overdrive level.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cocoa quality assessment methods are time-consuming, destructive, and difficult to scale, creating need for rapid, reliable, non-invasive alternatives.

Method: Uses conveyor belt system integrated with VIS-NIR spectrometer and learning-based regression models to predict physicochemical properties from spectral signatures of cocoa beans.

Result: Models achieved R² scores exceeding 0.98 across all physicochemical properties and 0.96 accuracy on geographically independent samples from different Colombian regions and Peru.

Conclusion: This non-destructive approach represents a suitable and scalable alternative to conventional laboratory methods for quality assessment across the cocoa production chain.

Abstract: Cocoa bean quality assessment is essential for ensuring compliance with
commercial standards, protecting consumer health, and increasing the market
value of the cocoa product. The quality assessment estimates key
physicochemical properties, such as fermentation level, moisture content,
polyphenol concentration, and cadmium content, among others. This assessment
has traditionally relied on the accurate estimation of these properties via
visual or sensory evaluation, jointly with laboratory-based physicochemical
analyses, which are often time-consuming, destructive, and difficult to scale.
This creates the need for rapid, reliable, and noninvasive alternatives.
Spectroscopy, particularly in the visible and near-infrared ranges, offers a
non-invasive alternative by capturing the molecular signatures associated with
these properties. Therefore, this work introduces a scalable methodology for
evaluating the quality of cocoa beans by predicting key physicochemical
properties from the spectral signatures of cocoa beans. This approach utilizes
a conveyor belt system integrated with a VIS-NIR spectrometer, coupled with
learning-based regression models. Furthermore, a dataset is built using cocoa
bean batches from Santander, Colombia. Ground-truth reference values were
obtained through standardized laboratory analyses and following commercial
cocoa quality regulations. To further evaluate the proposed methodology's
generalization, performance is tested on samples collected from other Colombian
regions and from Cusco, Peru. Experimental results show that the proposed
models achieved R2 scores exceeding 0.98 across all physicochemical properties,
and reached 0.96 accuracy on geographically independent samples. This
non-destructive approach represents a suitable and scalable alternative to
conventional laboratory methods for quality assessment across the cocoa
production chain.

### [197] [Inferring Group Intent as a Cooperative Game. An NLP-based Framework for Trajectory Analysis using Graph Transformer Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23905)
*Yiming Zhang,Vikram Krishnamurthy,Shashwat Jain*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper models group target trajectory intent as a cooperative game, using NLP-based generative models and game theory concepts like characteristic functions, core, Shapley value, and nucleolus to generate coordinated spatio-temporal patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize and infer group trajectory intent from noisy observations by treating it as a cooperative game, enabling better understanding of coordinated multi-target behaviors.

Method: Uses Fisher-information-based characteristic function for cooperative games, NLP-based generative model with formal grammar for trajectory patterns, and Graph Transformer Neural Network (GTNN) for intent inference from observational data.

Result: Developed a framework that generates realistic multi-target trajectory data and accurately infers group intent using GTNN, bridging target tracking and intent inference through a multi-layer approach.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully formalizes group trajectory intent as cooperative games and provides effective inference methods, offering a comprehensive solution for understanding coordinated multi-target behaviors.

Abstract: This paper studies group target trajectory intent as the outcome of a
cooperative game where the complex-spatio trajectories are modeled using an
NLP-based generative model. In our framework, the group intent is specified by
the characteristic function of a cooperative game, and allocations for players
in the cooperative game are specified by either the core, the Shapley value, or
the nucleolus. The resulting allocations induce probability distributions that
govern the coordinated spatio-temporal trajectories of the targets that reflect
the group's underlying intent. We address two key questions: (1) How can the
intent of a group trajectory be optimally formalized as the characteristic
function of a cooperative game? (2) How can such intent be inferred from noisy
observations of the targets? To answer the first question, we introduce a
Fisher-information-based characteristic function of the cooperative game, which
yields probability distributions that generate coordinated spatio-temporal
patterns. As a generative model for these patterns, we develop an NLP-based
generative model built on formal grammar, enabling the creation of realistic
multi-target trajectory data. To answer the second question, we train a Graph
Transformer Neural Network (GTNN) to infer group trajectory intent-expressed as
the characteristic function of the cooperative game-from observational data
with high accuracy. The self-attention function of the GTNN depends on the
track estimates. Thus, the formulation and algorithms provide a multi-layer
approach that spans target tracking (Bayesian signal processing) and the GTNN
(for group intent inference).

### [198] [Machine Learning-Driven User Localization in RIS-Assisted Wireless Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23908)
*M. T. Hassan,D. Zelenchuk,M. A. B. Abbasi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: ML-based user localization framework for RIS-assisted 6G networks that predicts angular position using received signal power measurements, reducing beam search overhead and latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G requires precise beam alignment in mmWave bands, but RIS enlarges beam search space making exhaustive sweeps inefficient due to control overhead and latency.

Method: Uses 20x20 RIS to reflect signals across 0-90° elevation plane divided into 4 sectors. Trains multiple ML regressors (DT, SVR, KNN, XGBoost, gradient boosting, random forest) on received power data to predict user angular position from 4 power measurements.

Result: DT model achieves MAE of 4.8° with R²=0.96, other models reach 70-86% accuracy. Predicted radiation patterns closely track ground truth with main lobe alignment between 52-55°.

Conclusion: Framework reduces beam probing, enables faster alignment, and lowers latency for RIS-assisted 6G networks.

Abstract: The sixth generation (6G) targets ultra reliable, low latency (URLLC) gigabit
connectivity in mmWave bands, where directional channels require precise beam
alignment. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) reshape wave propagation
and extend coverage, but they enlarge the beam search space at the base
station, making exhaustive sweeps inefficient due to control overhead and
latency. We propose an ML based user localization framework for RIS assisted
communication at 27 GHz. A 20x20 RIS reflects signals from a core network
connected base station and sweeps beams across the 0-90 degree elevation plane,
divided into four angular sectors. We build a dataset by recording received
signal power (Pr in dBm) across user locations and train multiple regressors,
including decision tree (DT), support vector regressor (SVR), k nearest
neighbor (KNN), XGBoost, gradient boosting, and random forest. In operation, an
unknown user in the same plane measures four received power values (one per
sector) and reports them to the pretrained RIS controller, which predicts the
user's angular position in real time. Evaluation using mean absolute error
(MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R squared (R2) shows high accuracy.
The DT model achieves an MAE of 4.8 degrees with R2 = 0.96, while other models
reach 70 to 86 percent. Predicted radiation patterns, including main lobe
alignment between 52 and 55 degrees, closely track ground truth. The framework
reduces beam probing, enables faster alignment, and lowers latency for RIS
assisted 6G networks.

*Brian Skoglind,Travis Roberts,Sourabh Karmakar,Cameron Turner,Laine Mears*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Acoustic-based verification system for detecting electrical connector mating sounds in noisy industrial environments, achieving over 75% effectiveness in connection state detection without modifying existing processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual electrical connections in automated assembly lines are prone to defects due to human error, leading to downtime and rework. Existing detection methods have limitations, and acoustic verification hasn't been extensively researched due to low signal-to-noise ratio challenges.

Method: Employed physical system for background noise mitigation and noise signature amplification algorithm to increase SNR between connector mating sounds and plant soundscape.

Result: The solution is over 75% effective at detecting and classifying connection state.

Conclusion: Acoustic-based verification can successfully detect electrical connector mating in noisy industrial environments without requiring modifications to existing manual interconnection processes.

Abstract: Modern consumer products are full of interconnected electrical and electronic
modules to fulfill direct and indirect needs. In an automated assembly line
still, most of these interconnections are required to be done manually due to
the large variety of connector types, connector positions, and the soft,
flexible nature of their structures. The manual connection points are the
source of partial or completely loose connections. Sometimes connections are
missed due to the application of unequal mating forces and natural human
fatigue. Subsequently, these defects can lead to unexpected downtime and
expensive rework. For successful connection detection, past approaches such as
vision verification, Augmented Reality, or circuit parameter-based measurements
have shown limited ability to detect the correct connection state. Though most
connections emit a specific noise for successful mating, the acoustic-based
verification system for electrical connection confirmation has not been
extensively researched. The main discouraging reason for such research is the
typically low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) between the sound of a pair of
electrical connector mating and the diverse soundscape of the plant. In this
study, the authors investigated increasing the SNR between the electrical
connector mating sound and the plant soundscape to improve connection success
detection by employing a physical system for background noise mitigation and
the successful met noise signature amplification algorithm. The solution is
over 75% effective at detecting and classifying connection state. The solution
has been constructed without any modification to the existing manual
interconnection process.

*Zihan Zhao,Masood Mortazavi,Ning Yan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: PULSE framework enables stress detection using only low-cost sensors (ECG, BVP, ACC, TEMP) by transferring knowledge from EDA during pretraining, eliminating the need for expensive EDA hardware during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EDA is the primary signal for stress detection but requires costly hardware unavailable in real-world wearables, creating a need for methods that can leverage EDA knowledge while using more accessible sensors.

Method: Self-supervised pretraining with EDA, separating encoder outputs into shared and private embeddings, aligning shared embeddings across modalities, and knowledge transfer from frozen EDA teacher to student encoders for other modalities.

Result: Achieves strong stress-detection performance on WESAD dataset, demonstrating that EDA representations can be effectively transferred to low-cost sensors.

Conclusion: Privileged EDA representations can be successfully transferred to low-cost sensors, improving stress detection accuracy while significantly reducing hardware costs.

Abstract: Electrodermal activity (EDA), the primary signal for stress detection,
requires costly hardware often unavailable in real-world wearables. In this
paper, we propose PULSE, a framework that utilizes EDA exclusively during
self-supervised pretraining, while enabling inference without EDA but with more
readily available modalities such as ECG, BVP, ACC, and TEMP. Our approach
separates encoder outputs into shared and private embeddings. We align shared
embeddings across modalities and fuse them into a modality-invariant
representation. The private embeddings carry modality-specific information to
support the reconstruction objective. Pretraining is followed by knowledge
transfer where a frozen EDA teacher transfers sympathetic-arousal
representations into student encoders. On WESAD, our method achieves strong
stress-detection performance, showing that representations of privileged EDA
can be transferred to low-cost sensors to improve accuracy while reducing
hardware cost.

*Kwadwo Mensah Obeng Afrane,Yang Miao,André B. J. Kokkeler*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Sub-band full-duplex cell-free massive MIMO enables simultaneous uplink communication and radar sensing by using non-overlapping frequency sub-bands, eliminating mutual interference between communication and radar signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of self-interference cancellation and mutual interference between uplink communication signals and radar echoes in in-band full-duplex joint communication and sensing systems.

Method: Proposes sub-band full-duplex cell-free massive MIMO system with active downlink sensing on downlink sub-bands and uplink communication on uplink sub-bands, assuming efficient inter-sub-band interference suppression.

Result: Each access point can estimate sensing parameters with high accuracy in the proposed system.

Conclusion: Sub-band full-duplex is a viable alternative duplexing scheme for simultaneous uplink communication and target parameter estimation in cell-free massive MIMO JCAS systems.

Abstract: In-band Full-duplex joint communication and sensing systems require self
interference cancellation as well as decoupling of the mutual interference
between UL communication signals and radar echoes. We present sub-band
full-duplex as an alternative duplexing scheme to achieve simultaneous uplink
communication and target parameter estimation in a cell-free massive MIMO
system. Sub-band full-duplex allows uplink and downlink transmissions
simultaneously on non-overlapping frequency resources via explicitly defined
uplink and downlink sub-bands in each timeslot. Thus, we propose a sub-band
full-duplex cell-free massive MIMO system with active downlink sensing on
downlink sub-bands and uplink communication on uplink sub-band. In the proposed
system, the target illumination signal is transmitted on the downlink (radar)
sub-band whereas uplink users transmit on the uplink (communication) sub-band.
By assuming efficient suppression of inter-sub-band interference between radar
and communication sub-bands, uplink communication and radar signals can be
efficiently processed without mutual interference. We show that each AP can
estimate sensing parameters with high accuracy in SBFD cell-free massive MIMO
JCAS systems.

*Mahmut Kemal Ercan,Alireza Pourafzal,Musa Furkan Keskin,Sinan Gezici,Henk Wymeersch*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to obfuscate time-of-arrival (ToA) estimation in OFDM systems by designing pilot distortions that increase sidelobes in the mismatched ambiguity function while maintaining communication performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a signal-level mechanism that can deliberately degrade ToA estimation at base stations for privacy/security purposes without requiring protocol changes or artificial path injection, while preserving communication quality.

Method: Design complex per-subcarrier distortion vectors that increase sidelobes of the mismatched ambiguity function using two objectives (sidelobe-to-peak ratio and integrated sidelobe level), subject to transmit-power and pilot dissimilarity constraints. Solved using Dinkelbach's transform and difference-of-convex updates with closed-form KKT steps.

Result: Simulations show optimized distortions successfully raise MAF sidelobes and degrade delay estimation (validated by mismatched ML ToA estimator) while incurring only marginal capacity loss across a broad SNR range.

Conclusion: The method provides an effective signal-level mechanism to control ToA observability under communication constraints, requiring no protocol modifications or artificial techniques.

Abstract: We study uplink orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) pilot
distortion to deliberately obfuscate time-of-arrival (ToA) estimation at a
single base station while preserving communication performance. We design a
complex per-subcarrier distortion vector that increases sidelobes of the
mismatched ambiguity function (MAF) relative to its mainlobe, using two
objectives: the sidelobe-to-peak level ratio and the integrated sidelobe level.
The design is subject to a transmit-power budget and a proximity
(dissimilarity) constraint around the communication-optimal pilot.
Communication impact is quantied by a capacity-motivated lower bound obtained
from the linear minimum mean-squared error error covariance with a mismatched
channel estimate. The resulting generalized fractional program is solved with
Dinkelbach's transform and a difference-of-convex update that yields a
closed-form Karush-Kuhn-Tucker step. Simulations on a single-input
single-output OFDM link show that the optimized distortions raise MAF sidelobes
and degrade delay estimation, as validated by a mismatched maximum-likelihood
ToA estimator, while incurring only marginal capacity loss over a broad
signal-to-noise ratio range. The method requires no protocol changes or
artificial path injection and provides a signal-level mechanism to control ToA
observability under communication constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of simultaneously performing downlink/uplink communications with multiple users while sensing multiple targets in full-duplex ISAC systems, focusing on beamforming and power allocation optimization.

Method: Derives optimal receive beamformers using closed-form Generalized Rayleigh Quotient solution, then solves remaining optimization problem using floating-point Genetic Algorithms to maximize communication sum-rate under sensing and power constraints.

Result: GA-based solution achieves up to 98% enhancement in sum-rate compared to baseline half-duplex ISAC system and outperforms benchmark algorithms, while providing insights into sensing performance effects and communication-sensing trade-offs.

Conclusion: The proposed joint beamforming strategy effectively balances communication and sensing requirements in multi-target scenarios, demonstrating significant performance improvements over existing approaches.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a full-duplex (FD) Integrated Sensing and
Communication (ISAC) system, in which the base station (BS) performs downlink
and uplink communications with multiple users while simultaneously sensing
multiple targets. In the scope of this work, we assume a narrowband and static
scenario, aiming to focus on the beamforming and power allocation strategies.
We propose a joint beamforming strategy for designing transmit and receive
beamformer vectors at the BS. The optimization problem aims to maximize the
communication sum-rate, which is critical for ensuring high-quality service to
users, while also maintaining accurate sensing performance for detection tasks
and adhering to maximum power constraints for efficient resource usage. The
optimal receive beamformers are first derived using a closed-form Generalized
Rayleigh Quotient (GRQ) solution, reducing the variables to be optimized. Then,
the remaining problem is solved using floating-point Genetic Algorithms (GA).
The numerical results show that the proposed GA-based solution demonstrates up
to a 98% enhancement in sum-rate compared to a baseline half-duplex ISAC system
and provides better performance than a benchmark algorithm from the literature.
Additionally, it offers insights into sensing performance effects on beam
patterns as well as communicationsensing trade-offs in multi-target scenarios.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A digital twin-assisted framework for UAV trajectory design in unknown environments, using integrated sensing and communication to progressively build virtual environments that enhance training and deployment safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAVs are crucial for low-altitude wireless networks when terrestrial networks are unavailable, but designing safe and efficient trajectories in unknown environments is challenging.

Method: Digital twin-assisted framework with integrated sensing and communication signals, using simulated annealing for user scheduling and twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient for continuous trajectory design.

Result: The approach achieves faster convergence, higher flight safety, and shorter mission completion time compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: Provides a robust and efficient solution for LAWN deployment in unknown environments through digital twin-assisted training and deployment.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are emerging as key enablers for low-altitude
wireless network (LAWN), particularly when terrestrial networks are
unavailable. In such scenarios, the environmental topology is typically
unknown; hence, designing efficient and safe UAV trajectories is essential yet
challenging. To address this, we propose a digital twin (DT)-assisted training
and deployment framework. In this framework, the UAV transmits integrated
sensing and communication signals to provide communication services to ground
users, while simultaneously collecting echoes that are uploaded to the DT
server to progressively construct virtual environments (VEs). These VEs
accelerate model training and are continuously updated with real-time UAV
sensing data during deployment, supporting decision-making and enhancing flight
safety. Based on this framework, we further develop a trajectory design scheme
that integrates simulated annealing for efficient user scheduling with the
twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm for continuous
trajectory design, aiming to minimize mission completion time while ensuring
obstacle avoidance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach
achieves faster convergence, higher flight safety, and shorter mission
completion time compared with baseline methods, providing a robust and
efficient solution for LAWN deployment in unknown environments.

*Richard Koebe,Noah Saibel,Juan Miguel Lopez Alcaraz,Simon Schäfer,Nils Strodthoff*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper proposes predicting catecholamine initiation rather than hypotension thresholds as a more clinically actionable approach for ICU decision support, achieving AUROC 0.822 using XGBoost with MAP dynamics and treatment context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ML models predict hypotension using fixed MAP thresholds or MAP forecasting, overlooking the clinical decision behind treatment escalation. Predicting catecholamine initiation offers a more clinically actionable target reflecting real decision-making.

Method: Using MIMIC-III database, modeled catecholamine initiation as binary event within 15-minute window. Used XGBoost with features including MAP statistical descriptors from 2-hour sliding window, demographics, biometrics, comorbidities, and ongoing treatments. Interpreted via SHAP analysis.

Result: Model achieved AUROC 0.822 (0.813-0.830), outperforming hypotension baseline (MAP < 65, AUROC 0.686). SHAP analysis showed recent MAP values, MAP trends, and ongoing treatments as dominant predictors. Higher performance in males, younger patients, higher BMI, and those without comorbidities.

Conclusion: Predicting catecholamine initiation based on MAP dynamics and treatment context supports critical therapy escalation decisions, shifting focus from threshold-based alarms to actionable decision support. Future work should enrich temporal context and extend label definitions.

Abstract: Hypotension in critically ill ICU patients is common and life-threatening.
Escalation to catecholamine therapy marks a key management step, with both
undertreatment and overtreatment posing risks. Most machine learning (ML)
models predict hypotension using fixed MAP thresholds or MAP forecasting,
overlooking the clinical decision behind treatment escalation. Predicting
catecholamine initiation, the start of vasoactive or inotropic agent
administration offers a more clinically actionable target reflecting real
decision-making. Using the MIMIC-III database, we modeled catecholamine
initiation as a binary event within a 15-minute prediction window. Input
features included statistical descriptors from a two-hour sliding MAP context
window, along with demographics, biometrics, comorbidities, and ongoing
treatments. An Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model was trained and
interpreted via SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). The model achieved an
AUROC of 0.822 (0.813-0.830), outperforming the hypotension baseline (MAP < 65,
AUROC 0.686 [0.675-0.699]). SHAP analysis highlighted recent MAP values, MAP
trends, and ongoing treatments (e.g., sedatives, electrolytes) as dominant
predictors. Subgroup analysis showed higher performance in males, younger
patients (<53 years), those with higher BMI (>32), and patients without
comorbidities or concurrent medications. Predicting catecholamine initiation
based on MAP dynamics, treatment context, and patient characteristics supports
the critical decision of when to escalate therapy, shifting focus from
threshold-based alarms to actionable decision support. This approach is
feasible across a broad ICU cohort under natural event imbalance. Future work
should enrich temporal and physiological context, extend label definitions to
include therapy escalation, and benchmark against existing hypotension
prediction systems.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Proposed a constant-envelope waveform design compatible with CP-OFDMA framework that enables low-complexity transceivers while maintaining compatibility with existing standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OFDM has limited power efficiency due to high envelope fluctuations, and existing high-efficiency waveforms are incompatible with CP-OFDMA framework and ineffective in multi-user downlink transmissions.

Method: Developed CP-OFDMA-compatible CE waveform structure with optimized pulse-shaping filter, designed time-domain binary pilot sequence for frequency-domain CE properties, proposed multi-stage channel estimation with delay-domain denoising, and created low-complexity LMMSE equalizer exploiting CE signal properties.

Result: Achieves bit error rate performance close to ideal case while significantly reducing transceiver complexity compared to existing CE waveform solutions.

Conclusion: The proposed CE waveform design successfully addresses OFDM's power efficiency limitations while maintaining full compatibility with CP-OFDMA framework and enabling practical multi-user downlink transmissions.

Abstract: OFDM is widely adopted in modern wireless communication systems, but its
power efficiency is limited by high envelope fluctuations. Although various
high power-efficiency waveforms have been proposed, most are incompatible with
the CP-OFDMA framework and remain ineffective in multi-user downlink
transmissions. To address this issue, we propose a constant-envelope (CE)
waveform design, which enables low-complexity transceiver architectures while
maintaining full compatibility with the prevailing CP-OFDMA framework.
Specifically, we start from a general CE FDMA signal model and develop a
CP-OFDMA-compatible waveform implementation structure, followed by the design
of an optimized CE-constrained pulse-shaping filter to suppress out-of-band
emissions. To tackle channel estimation challenge under non-flat
frequency-domain pilots induced by CE modulation, we optimize the time-domain
binary pilot sequence to achieve frequency-domain CE properties, and then
propose a multi-stage method combining delay-domain denoising with power delay
profile estimation to facilitate reduced-dimension LMMSE estimation.
Subsequently, we design a low-complexity maximum ratio combining-aided LMMSE
equalizer by exploiting the periodicity and conjugate symmetry of the CE
received signals. To mitigate the downlink peak-to-average power ratio increase
caused by FDMA, we further develop a multi-user downlink CE transmission scheme
including multiple access mechanism, downlink control information design, and
corresponding system-level implementation, which ensures compatibility with the
New Radio standard. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme
achieves bit error rate performance close to the ideal case while significantly
reducing transceiver complexity compared to existing CE waveform solutions.

TL;DR: A learning-based CSI prediction framework using DNN and LSTM networks to forecast future SINR values, addressing channel aging issues in TDD 5G systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Channel aging caused by user mobility and processing delays degrades CSI accuracy in TDD systems, leading to suboptimal link adaptation and performance loss.

Method: Proposes a learning-based CSI prediction framework that leverages temporal correlations in wireless channels to forecast future SINR values using EESM mapping. Two models are implemented: a fully connected DNN and an LSTM-based network.

Result: LSTM predictor achieves up to 2 dB improvement in NMSE and up to 1.2 Mbps throughput gain over baseline without prediction under moderate Doppler conditions.

Conclusion: Lightweight AI-based CSI prediction can effectively mitigate channel aging and enhance link adaptation in TDD 5G systems.

Abstract: Time division duplexing (TDD) has become the dominant duplexing mode in 5G
and beyond due to its ability to exploit channel reciprocity for efficient
downlink channel state information (CSI) acquisition. However, channel aging
caused by user mobility and processing delays degrades the accuracy of CSI,
leading to suboptimal link adaptation and loss of performance. To address this
issue, we propose a learning-based CSI prediction framework that leverages
temporal correlations in wireless channels to forecast future signal to
interference plus noise ratio (SINR) values. The prediction operates in the
effective SINR domain, obtained via exponential effective SINR mapping (EESM),
ensuring full compatibility with existing 5G standards without requiring
continuous pilot signaling. Two models are considered: a fully connected deep
neural network (DNN) and an long short-term memory (LSTM)-based network. The
simulation results show that the LSTM predictor achieves an improvement of up
to 2 dB in normalized mean squared error (NMSE) and a gain of up to 1.2 Mbps
throughput over a baseline without prediction under moderate Doppler
conditions. These results confirm the potential of lightweight AI-based CSI
prediction to effectively mitigate channel aging and enhance link adaptation in
TDD 5G systems.

Abstract: With the development of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, implementing
AI-based techniques to improve wireless transceivers becomes an emerging
research topic. Within this context, AI-based channel characterization and
estimation become the focus since these methods have not been solved by
traditional methods very well and have become the bottleneck of transceiver
efficiency in large-scale orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
systems. Specifically, by formulating channel estimation as a generative AI
problem, generative AI methods such as diffusion models (DMs) can efficiently
deal with rough initial estimations and have great potential to cooperate with
traditional signal processing methods. This paper focuses on the transceiver
design of OFDM systems based on DMs, provides an illustration of the potential
of DMs in wireless transceivers, and points out the related research directions
brought by DMs. We also provide a proof-of-concept case study of further
adapting DMs for better wireless receiver performance.

### [210] [Quality Coefficients for Interferometric Phase Linking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24512)
*Magnus Heimpel,Irena Hajnsek,Othmar Frey*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces three quality criteria for phase linking in multi-temporal InSAR: closure phase coefficient for internal consistency, goodness-of-fit coefficient for approximation quality, and ambiguity coefficient for solution stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve pixel selection and quality control in multi-temporal InSAR by assessing the reliability of estimated phase histories from distributed scatterers, addressing the issue of inconsistent phase information in coherence matrices.

Method: Proposes three normalized coefficients within a unified mathematical framework: closure phase coefficient, goodness-of-fit coefficient, and ambiguity coefficient. These are designed with explicit noise-floor correction and normalization to unit interval for better interpretability across different stack sizes.

Result: Experiments on TerraSAR-X data show that the closure phase coefficient effectively pre-screens stable areas, the goodness-of-fit coefficient generalizes established quality indicators, and the ambiguity coefficient identifies unstable solutions that otherwise fit well.

Conclusion: The three proposed coefficients together enable systematic pixel selection and quality control in interferometric processing of distributed scatterers, improving reliability assessment in multi-temporal InSAR applications.

Abstract: In multi-temporal InSAR, phase linking refers to the estimation of a
single-reference interferometric phase history from the information contained
in the coherence matrix of a distributed scatterer. Since the phase information
in the coherence matrix is typically inconsistent, the extent to which the
estimated phase history captures it must be assessed to exclude unreliable
pixels from further processing. We introduce three quality criteria in the form
of coefficients, for threshold-based pixel selection: a coefficient based on
closure phase that quantifies the internal consistency of the phase information
in the coherence matrix; a goodness-of-fit coefficient that quantifies how well
a resulting phase history estimate approximates the phase information according
to the characteristic optimization model of a given phase linking method; and
an ambiguity coefficient that compares the goodness of fit of the original
estimate with that of an orthogonal alternative. We formulate the phase linking
methods and these criteria within a unified mathematical framework and discuss
computational and algorithmic aspects. Unlike existing goodness-of-fit
indicators, the proposed coefficients are normalized to the unit interval with
explicit noise-floor correction, improving interpretability across stacks of
different size. Experiments on TerraSAR-X data over Visp, Switzerland, indicate
that the closure phase coefficient effectively pre-screens stable areas, the
goodness-of-fit coefficient aligns with and systematically generalizes
established quality indicators, and the ambiguity coefficient flags solutions
that fit well but are unstable. Together, the coefficients enable systematic
pixel selection and quality control in the interferometric processing of
distributed scatterers.

Conclusion: SSF delivers robust, low-overhead feedback and adaptability to support a wide range of ISAC (Integrated Sensing and Communication) applications in 6G networks.

Abstract: 6G wireless networks are poised to seamlessly integrate communication,
computing, localization, and sensing functionalities, ensuring high reliability
and trustworthiness. This paper introduces Smart Sensing Feedback (SSF), a
limited-feedback framework designed to enhance sensing capabilities while
maintaining communication performance. SSF adapts the concept of retransmission

*Longpan Wang,Zhuoran Zhang,Zhenyuan Li,Xuetao Gan,Xudong Bai,Wen Chen,Qingqing Wu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A wideband digital reflective metasurface for S-band applications that enables dynamic EM wave control, supporting multi-mode OAM beam generation, beam scanning, and direction finding for secure sensing and communications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most metasurfaces operate at high frequencies due to dielectric substrate constraints, limiting full-wave system applications. This work addresses the need for lower-frequency S-band metasurfaces with dynamic control capabilities.

Method: Designed using electronically reconfigurable meta-atoms with trapezoidal and M-shaped patches connected by pin diodes, achieving 1-bit phase quantization. A 20x20-unit array was fabricated and tested with dynamic coding sequence adjustment.

Result: Achieved wideband 1-bit phase quantization with stable phase difference (180° ± 25°) and low reflection loss (<0.6 dB) from 2.72-3.25 GHz. Demonstrated multi-mode OAM beam generation, dynamic beam scanning, and precise direction finding.

Conclusion: The proposed wideband metasurface effectively enhances spectral efficiency and security performance for radar and wireless systems through high-resolution target detection, anti-jamming beam steering, and physical-layer security.

Abstract: Digital metasurfaces have attracted significant attention in recent years due
to their ability to manipulate electromagnetic (EM) waves for secure sensing
and communication. However, most reported metasurfaces operate at relatively
high frequencies, primarily due to the constraints imposed by the physical
scale of the dielectric substrate, thus limiting their full-wave system
applications. In this work, a wideband digital reflective metasurface is
presented for capable of dynamically controlling EM waves, with multifunctional
applications in the lower-frequency S-band. The metasurface is composed of
electronically reconfigurable meta-atoms with wideband characteristics, and
designed by using trapezoidal and M-shaped patches connected by a pin diode.
Simulation results show that the proposed digital metasurface could achieve
wideband 1-bit phase quantization with a stable phase difference within 180
degree +/- 25 degree and small reflection loss below 0.6 dB from 2.72 to 3.25
GHz. To validate the proposed design, a 20x20-unit metasurface array was
designed, simulated and fabricated. By dynamically adjusting the coding
sequence, the metasurface could enable multi-mode orbital angular momentum
(OAM) beam generation, dynamic beam scanning, and precise direction finding.
These capabilities support secure sensing and secure communications through
high-resolution target detection and anti-jamming beam steering, as well as
physical-layer security. The proposed wideband metasurface may serve as an
effective candidate for enhancing spectral efficiency and security performance
in radar and wireless systems.

*Hong Niu,Jiancheng An,Chau Yuen*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Proposes a flexible intelligent layered metasurface (FILM) architecture using shape-controllable flexible metasurfaces to reduce power attenuation and layer count while maintaining signal processing performance in multi-user MISO systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) suffer from severe power attenuation due to deep stacking requirements and uniform inter-layer spacing, limiting practical implementation.

Method: Developed a two-layer FILM-assisted MU-MISO system with alternating optimization method featuring closed-form phase shift updates and gradient descent-based shape optimization to solve the channel fitting problem.

Result: The proposed FILM architecture achieves over 200% improvement in sum-rate and more than 7 dB bit-error rate (BER) gain compared to conventional seven-layer SIMs.

Conclusion: Flexible metasurfaces significantly reduce required layers while maintaining performance, offering a practical solution to power attenuation issues in wave-domain signal processing systems.

Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) have recently gained attention as a
paradigm for wave-domain signal processing with reduced reliance on costly
radio-frequency (RF) chains. However, conventional SIMs rely on uniform
inter-layer spacing and require deep stacking to ensure processing capability,
resulting in severe power attenuation in practice. To address this issue, we
propose a flexible intelligent layered metasurface (FILM) architecture
consisting of two shape-controllable flexible metasurface layers. By replacing
rigid metasurfaces with flexible ones in both layers, the transmission
coefficient matrix can be dynamically adjusted, significantly decreasing the
number of required layers while maintaining signal processing performance.
Firstly, we develop a two-layer FILM-assisted multi-user multiple-input
single-output (MU-MISO) system, wherein we formulate a channel fitting problem
aimed at reducing the difference between the FILM-induced and target channels.
Then, we solve this non-convex problem by employing an alternating optimization
(AO) method, featuring closed-form phase shift updates and a gradient
descent-based shape optimization. Furthermore, we analyze the upper bound on
sum-rate and the complexity of computation to provide insights into design
trade-offs. Finally, simulation results demonstrated that the proposed
transmissive FILM architecture achieves over 200\% improvement in sum-rate and
more than 7 dB bit-error rate (BER) gain compared to the conventional
seven-layer SIMs.

*Vishal Halder,Alexandre Reiffers-Masson,Abdeldjalil Aïssa-El-Bey,Gugan Thoppe*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper shows that for arbitrary matrices A and sparse adversarial errors e, the best recoverable set from y = Ax* + e is x* + ker(U), where U is the projection onto the intersection of rowspaces of all submatrices of A with 2q rows deleted.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing recovery methods require strong structural assumptions on A or x* (like restricted isometry or sparsity). This work addresses the open problem of recoverability for arbitrary A and x* with sparse adversarial errors.

Method: The authors prove that the minimal recoverable set is x* + ker(U), where U is the unique projection matrix onto the intersection of rowspaces of all submatrices of A obtained by deleting 2q rows. They show every x minimizing the ℓ₀-norm of y - Ax lies in this set.

Result: The main result establishes that x* + ker(U) is the smallest uniformly recoverable set from y without knowing the sparse error vector e, and provides a constructive approach to recover this set.

Conclusion: For arbitrary matrices and sparse adversarial errors, the best possible recovery is limited to x* + ker(U), which represents the fundamental information-theoretic limit of what can be recovered without knowledge of the error pattern.

Abstract: Let \(\bm{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}\) be an arbitrary, known matrix and
\(\bm{e}\) a \(q\)-sparse adversarial vector. Given \(\bm{y} = \bm{A} x^* +
\bm{e}\) and \(q\), we seek the smallest set containing \(x^*\)-hence the one
conveying maximal information about \(x^*\)-that is uniformly recoverable from
\(\bm{y}\) without knowing \(\bm{e}\). While exact recovery of \(x^*\) via
strong (and often impractical) structural assumptions on \(\bm{A}\) or \(x^*\)
(for example, restricted isometry, sparsity) is well studied, recoverability
for arbitrary \(\bm{A}\) and \(x^*\) remains open. Our main result shows that
the best that one can hope to recover is \(x^* + \ker(\bm{U})\), where
\(\bm{U}\) is the unique projection matrix onto the intersection of rowspaces
of all possible submatrices of \(\bm{A}\) obtained by deleting \(2q\) rows.
Moreover, we prove that every \(x\) that minimizes the \(\ell\_0\)-norm of
\(\bm{y} - \bm{A} x\) lies in \(x^* + \ker(\bm{U})\), which then gives a
constructive approach to recover this set.

TL;DR: Proposes a digital precoding-free hierarchical rate-splitting multiple access (HRSMA) architecture using stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) to achieve high spectral efficiency and user fairness with reduced hardware complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interference management is a central bottleneck in dense multi-antenna wireless networks, and there's a need for solutions that reduce hardware complexity while maintaining performance.

Method: Uses a multi-layer SIM as a wave-domain processor for spatial user separation and interference mitigation, eliminating digital/hybrid precoding. Jointly optimizes SIM phase shifts, power allocation, and user grouping using alternating optimization with SPSA and clustering.

Result: Achieves substantial gains in spectral efficiency and fairness compared to hybrid beamforming and non-precoding baselines, with comparable or superior minimum rates using significantly fewer active antennas.

Conclusion: SIM-aided HRSMA is a promising low-cost, energy-efficient, and scalable solution for beyond-6G networks by exploiting wave-domain degrees of freedom.

Abstract: Interference management is a central bottleneck in dense multi-antenna
wireless networks. Therefore, in this study, we present a digital
precoding-free hierarchical rate-splitting multiple access (HRSMA) architecture
assisted by a stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) to achieve high spectral
efficiency and user fairness with reduced hardware complexity. In the proposed
system, the base station performs only scalar power allocation, while a
multi-layer SIM acts as a wave-domain processor that spatially separates users
and mitigates interference via nonlinear wavefront reconfiguration. This design
eliminates the need for digital or hybrid precoding, drastically reducing the
baseband computations. A joint optimization problem is formulated to maximize
the minimum user rate by jointly optimizing SIM phase shifts, power allocation,
and user grouping. To efficiently solve the resulting non-convex problem, an
alternating optimization algorithm is developed, combining simultaneous
perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) for SIM configuration and power
control with clustering-based grouping refinement. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed SIM-aided HRSMA achieves substantial gains in
both spectral efficiency and fairness compared to hybrid beamforming and
non-precoding baselines. Specifically, SIM-aided HRSMA attains comparable or
superior minimum rates with significantly fewer active antennas by exploiting
the additional wave-domain degrees of freedom provided by multi-layer SIMs.
These findings highlight the potential of SIM-aided HRSMA as a low-cost,
energy-efficient, and scalable solution for beyond-6G networks.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a semi-passive dual-RIS-assisted ISAC system for 6G, using joint active/passive beamforming to maximize minimum user SINR while ensuring fairness. An efficient alternating optimization algorithm with sensing-assisted discrete phase shift optimization achieves near-ideal performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To meet 6G requirements by enhancing integrated sensing and communication system performance and ensuring user fairness through dual-RIS assistance and max-min SINR optimization.

Method: Uses dual RISs for user angle estimation, then develops alternating optimization with semi-definite relaxation and bisection method for transmit beamforming. For RIS discrete phase shifts, employs sensing-assisted approach with low-complexity search strategies based on RIS size.

Result: The proposed algorithm achieves performance close to ideal continuous phase shift benchmark, outperforms conventional discrete phase shift optimization methods, and shows significant improvement over single-RIS systems.

Conclusion: Dual-RIS-assisted ISAC with the proposed joint optimization framework effectively enhances system performance and user fairness for 6G applications, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Targeting the requirements of 6G, this paper investigates a semi-passive
dual-reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted integrated sensing and
communication (ISAC) system, tackling the max-min user
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) problem via joint active and
passive beamforming to enhance system performance and ensure user fairness.
Addressing this challenge, we first utilize dual RISs for user angle estimation
to simplify the solution process of the formulated problem, an efficient
alternating optimization algorithm is then developed. Specifically,
semi-definite relaxation and the bisection method are employed to solve the
transmit beamforming optimization subproblem. For the RIS discrete phase
shifts, a sensing-assisted approach is adopted to constrain the optimization
search space, with two distinct low-complexity search strategies introduced for
different RIS sizes. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm achieves performance close to the ideal continuous phase shift
benchmark, outperforms conventional discrete phase shift optimization
algorithms, and exhibits a significant improvement over single-RIS systems.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: A dual-mind world model framework is proposed for wireless networks, combining pattern-driven System 1 and logic-driven System 2 components to optimize CAoI in mmWave V2X scenarios, achieving superior data efficiency and generalization compared to traditional RL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL approaches in wireless networks are data inefficient and short-sighted, failing to capture underlying physics and logic, which limits generalization to novel network states in complex dynamic environments with long-term planning requirements.

Method: Proposes a dual-mind world model with System 1 (pattern-driven) and System 2 (logic-driven) components that learn wireless network dynamics and logic, enabling long-term link scheduling through differentiable imagined trajectories with logical consistency over extended horizons.

Result: The proposed world model achieves significant improvement in data efficiency and strong generalization/adaptation to unseen environments compared to state-of-the-art RL baselines and single-system world models, maintaining efficient decision-making even without observations.

Conclusion: The dual-mind world model framework effectively addresses limitations of traditional RL methods in wireless networks by combining pattern recognition with logical reasoning, enabling more efficient and generalizable link scheduling in complex mmWave V2X scenarios.

Abstract: Despite the popularity of reinforcement learning (RL) in wireless networks,
existing approaches that rely on model-free RL (MFRL) and model-based RL (MBRL)
are data inefficient and short-sighted. Such RL-based solutions cannot
generalize to novel network states since they capture only statistical patterns
rather than the underlying physics and logic from wireless data. These
limitations become particularly challenging in complex wireless networks with
high dynamics and long-term planning requirements. To address these
limitations, in this paper, a novel dual-mind world model-based learning
framework is proposed with the goal of optimizing completeness-weighted age of
information (CAoI) in a challenging mmWave V2X scenario. Inspired by cognitive
psychology, the proposed dual-mind world model encompasses a pattern-driven
System 1 component and a logic-driven System 2 component to learn dynamics and
logic of the wireless network, and to provide long-term link scheduling over
reliable imagined trajectories. Link scheduling is learned through end-to-end
differentiable imagined trajectories with logical consistency over an extended
horizon rather than relying on wireless data obtained from environment
interactions. Moreover, through imagination rollouts, the proposed world model
can jointly reason network states and plan link scheduling. During intervals
without observations, the proposed method remains capable of making efficient
decisions. Extensive experiments are conducted on a realistic simulator based
on Sionna with real-world physical channel, ray-tracing, and scene objects with
material properties. Simulation results show that the proposed world model
achieves a significant improvement in data efficiency and achieves strong
generalization and adaptation to unseen environments, compared to the
state-of-the-art RL baselines, and the world model approach with only System 1.

Conclusion: Feedback enables secure communication in reversely-degraded wiretap channels and motivates code designs for sensing-assisted secure communication in next-generation integrated systems.

Abstract: We consider reversely-degraded wiretap channels, for which the secrecy
capacity is zero if there is no channel feedback. This work focuses on a seeded
modular code design for the Gaussian wiretap channel with channel output
feedback, combining universal hash functions for security and learned
feedback-based codes for reliability to achieve positive secrecy rates. We
study the trade-off between communication reliability and information leakage,
illustrating that feedback enables agreeing on a secret key shared between
legitimate parties, overcoming the security advantage of the wiretapper. Our
findings also motivate code designs for sensing-assisted secure communication,
to be used in next-generation integrated sensing and communication methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ME-POMDPs extend POMDPs with model uncertainty, representing multiple POMDPs that share state/action/observation spaces but vary in transition, observation, and reward models. The paper generalizes these to AB-POMDPs, shows reduction methods, and develops exact/approximate algorithms for computing robust policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address scenarios where multiple domain experts disagree on problem modeling, requiring a single policy robust against any choice of POMDP within a set of possible models.

Method: Generalize ME-POMDPs to AB-POMDPs with sets of initial beliefs, prove reduction theorems that preserve policies, and develop exact and point-based approximate algorithms for computing robust policies.

Result: Successfully computed policies for standard POMDP benchmarks extended to multi-environment setting, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

Conclusion: The paper provides a comprehensive framework for handling model uncertainty in POMDPs through ME-POMDPs and AB-POMDPs, with practical algorithms that work on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Multi-environment POMDPs (ME-POMDPs) extend standard POMDPs with discrete
model uncertainty. ME-POMDPs represent a finite set of POMDPs that share the
same state, action, and observation spaces, but may arbitrarily vary in their
transition, observation, and reward models. Such models arise, for instance,
when multiple domain experts disagree on how to model a problem. The goal is to
find a single policy that is robust against any choice of POMDP within the set,
i.e., a policy that maximizes the worst-case reward across all POMDPs. We
generalize and expand on existing work in the following way. First, we show
that ME-POMDPs can be generalized to POMDPs with sets of initial beliefs, which
we call adversarial-belief POMDPs (AB-POMDPs). Second, we show that any
arbitrary ME-POMDP can be reduced to a ME-POMDP that only varies in its
transition and reward functions or only in its observation and reward
functions, while preserving (optimal) policies. We then devise exact and
approximate (point-based) algorithms to compute robust policies for AB-POMDPs,
and thus ME-POMDPs. We demonstrate that we can compute policies for standard
POMDP benchmarks extended to the multi-environment setting.

TL;DR: A framework using test-time tuning enhances pre-trained transformers for de novo molecular structure generation from tandem mass spectra, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by significant margins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods rely on database matching or multi-step pipelines with intermediate predictions, making it challenging to identify compounds absent from reference databases.

Method: Leverages test-time tuning to enhance a pre-trained transformer model for end-to-end molecular structure generation directly from tandem mass spectra and molecular formulae, bypassing manual annotations and intermediate steps.

Result: Surpasses the state-of-the-art DiffMS by 100% on NPLIB1 and 20% on MassSpecGym benchmarks. Test-time tuning provides 62% performance gain over conventional fine-tuning on MassSpecGym.

Conclusion: The framework enables dynamic adaptation to novel spectra and generates structurally accurate molecular candidates even when predictions deviate from ground truth, providing valuable guidance for human interpretation and more reliable identification.

Abstract: Tandem Mass Spectrometry enables the identification of unknown compounds in
crucial fields such as metabolomics, natural product discovery and
environmental analysis. However, current methods rely on database matching from
previously observed molecules, or on multi-step pipelines that require
intermediate fragment or fingerprint prediction. This makes finding the correct
molecule highly challenging, particularly for compounds absent from reference
databases. We introduce a framework that, by leveraging test-time tuning,
enhances the learning of a pre-trained transformer model to address this gap,
enabling end-to-end de novo molecular structure generation directly from the
tandem mass spectra and molecular formulae, bypassing manual annotations and
intermediate steps. We surpass the de-facto state-of-the-art approach DiffMS on
two popular benchmarks NPLIB1 and MassSpecGym by 100% and 20%, respectively.
Test-time tuning on experimental spectra allows the model to dynamically adapt
to novel spectra, and the relative performance gain over conventional
fine-tuning is of 62% on MassSpecGym. When predictions deviate from the ground
truth, the generated molecular candidates remain structurally accurate,
providing valuable guidance for human interpretation and more reliable
identification.

### [224] [Why Foundation Models in Pathology Are Failing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23807)
*Hamid R. Tizhoosh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Current pathology foundation models show fundamental weaknesses including low diagnostic accuracy, poor robustness, and safety vulnerabilities due to conceptual mismatches with tissue complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine why foundation models that revolutionized other domains are failing in computational pathology despite high expectations for cancer diagnosis and prognostication breakthroughs.

Method: Systematic evaluation and analysis of pathology foundation models to identify seven key causes of their shortcomings.

Result: Identified seven interrelated causes: biological complexity, ineffective self-supervision, overgeneralization, excessive architectural complexity, lack of domain-specific innovation, insufficient data, and fundamental design flaw in tissue patch size.

Conclusion: Current pathology foundation models are conceptually misaligned with tissue morphology and require fundamental paradigm rethinking rather than incremental improvements.

Abstract: In non-medical domains, foundation models (FMs) have revolutionized computer
vision and language processing through large-scale self-supervised and
multimodal learning. Consequently, their rapid adoption in computational
pathology was expected to deliver comparable breakthroughs in cancer diagnosis,
prognostication, and multimodal retrieval. However, recent systematic
evaluations reveal fundamental weaknesses: low diagnostic accuracy, poor
robustness, geometric instability, heavy computational demands, and concerning
safety vulnerabilities. This short paper examines these shortcomings and argues
that they stem from deeper conceptual mismatches between the assumptions
underlying generic foundation modeling in mainstream AI and the intrinsic
complexity of human tissue. Seven interrelated causes are identified:
biological complexity, ineffective self-supervision, overgeneralization,
excessive architectural complexity, lack of domain-specific innovation,
insufficient data, and a fundamental design flaw related to tissue patch size.
These findings suggest that current pathology foundation models remain
conceptually misaligned with the nature of tissue morphology and call for a
fundamental rethinking of the paradigm itself.

### [225] [ReCAP: Recursive Context-Aware Reasoning and Planning for Large Language Model Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23822)
*Zhenyu Zhang,Tianyi Chen,Weiran Xu,Alex Pentland,Jiaxin Pei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReCAP is a hierarchical framework with shared context for reasoning and planning in LLMs that improves long-horizon task performance through plan-ahead decomposition, structured re-injection of parent plans, and memory-efficient execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and dynamic re-planning remain challenging for LLMs, with existing sequential prompting methods suffering from context drift and hierarchical methods having continuity issues or high runtime overhead.

Method: ReCAP combines three key mechanisms: plan-ahead decomposition (generating full subtask list, executing first item, refining remainder), structured re-injection of parent plans (maintaining consistent multi-level context), and memory-efficient execution (bounding active prompt for linear cost scaling).

Result: ReCAP substantially improves subgoal alignment and success rates on various long-horizon reasoning benchmarks, achieving 32% gain on synchronous Robotouille and 29% improvement on asynchronous Robotouille under strict pass@1 protocol.

Conclusion: The ReCAP framework effectively aligns high-level goals with low-level actions, reduces redundant prompting, and preserves coherent context updates across recursion for improved long-horizon reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Long-horizon tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and dynamic re-planning
remain challenging for large language models (LLMs). Sequential prompting
methods are prone to context drift, loss of goal information, and recurrent
failure cycles, while hierarchical prompting methods often weaken cross-level
continuity or incur substantial runtime overhead. We introduce ReCAP (Recursive
Context-Aware Reasoning and Planning), a hierarchical framework with shared
context for reasoning and planning in LLMs. ReCAP combines three key
mechanisms: (i) plan-ahead decomposition, in which the model generates a full
subtask list, executes the first item, and refines the remainder; (ii)
structured re-injection of parent plans, maintaining consistent multi-level
context during recursive return; and (iii) memory-efficient execution, bounding
the active prompt so costs scale linearly with task depth. Together these
mechanisms align high-level goals with low-level actions, reduce redundant
prompting, and preserve coherent context updates across recursion. Experiments
demonstrate that ReCAP substantially improves subgoal alignment and success
rates on various long-horizon reasoning benchmarks, achieving a 32% gain on
synchronous Robotouille and a 29% improvement on asynchronous Robotouille under
the strict pass@1 protocol.

*Murad Ismayilov,Edwin Meriaux,Shuo Wen,Gregory Dudek*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-based agents achieve near-optimal performance in decentralized multi-agent goal assignment using structured environmental information and deterministic conflict resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of coordinating multiple autonomous agents in shared environments under decentralized conditions for multi-agent path planning.

Method: Agents independently generate ranked preferences over goals using structured environmental representations (grids and scenario data), exchange rankings, and use deterministic conflict-resolution rules without negotiation.

Result: LLM-based agents with well-designed prompts and quantitative information achieve near-optimal makespans and consistently outperform traditional heuristics.

Conclusion: Language models show strong potential for decentralized goal assignment in multi-agent systems, with information structure being crucial for performance.

Abstract: Coordinating multiple autonomous agents in shared environments under
decentralized conditions is a long-standing challenge in robotics and
artificial intelligence. This work addresses the problem of decentralized goal
assignment for multi-agent path planning, where agents independently generate
ranked preferences over goals based on structured representations of the
environment, including grid visualizations and scenario data. After this
reasoning phase, agents exchange their goal rankings, and assignments are
determined by a fixed, deterministic conflict-resolution rule (e.g., agent
index ordering), without negotiation or iterative coordination. We
systematically compare greedy heuristics, optimal assignment, and large
language model (LLM)-based agents in fully observable grid-world settings. Our
results show that LLM-based agents, when provided with well-designed prompts
and relevant quantitative information, can achieve near-optimal makespans and
consistently outperform traditional heuristics. These findings underscore the
potential of language models for decentralized goal assignment in multi-agent
path planning and highlight the importance of information structure in such
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprises struggle to move AI agents from prototypes to production systems that deliver measurable business value, facing challenges with fragmented frameworks, slow development, and lack of standardized evaluation practices.

Method: CUGA uses hierarchical planner-executor architecture with strong analytical foundations, evaluated on AppWorld, WebArena benchmarks and a pilot in Business-Process-Outsourcing talent acquisition domain.

Result: CUGA achieved state-of-the-art performance on AppWorld and WebArena, and in preliminary enterprise evaluations approached specialized agent accuracy while showing potential for reduced development time and cost.

Conclusion: The paper provides early evidence of generalist agents operating at enterprise scale and outlines requirements for advancing research architectures into robust enterprise-ready systems.

Abstract: Agents are rapidly advancing in automating digital work, but enterprises face
a harder challenge: moving beyond prototypes to deployed systems that deliver
measurable business value. This path is complicated by fragmented frameworks,
slow development, and the absence of standardized evaluation practices.
Generalist agents have emerged as a promising direction, excelling on academic
benchmarks and offering flexibility across task types, applications, and
modalities. Yet, evidence of their use in production enterprise settings
remains limited. This paper reports IBM's experience developing and piloting
the Computer Using Generalist Agent (CUGA), which has been open-sourced for the
community (https://github.com/cuga-project/cuga-agent). CUGA adopts a
hierarchical planner--executor architecture with strong analytical foundations,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on AppWorld and WebArena. Beyond
benchmarks, it was evaluated in a pilot within the Business-Process-Outsourcing
talent acquisition domain, addressing enterprise requirements for scalability,
auditability, safety, and governance. To support assessment, we introduce
BPO-TA, a 26-task benchmark spanning 13 analytics endpoints. In preliminary
evaluations, CUGA approached the accuracy of specialized agents while
indicating potential for reducing development time and cost. Our contribution
is twofold: presenting early evidence of generalist agents operating at
enterprise scale, and distilling technical and organizational lessons from this
initial pilot. We outline requirements and next steps for advancing
research-grade architectures like CUGA into robust, enterprise-ready systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel training algorithm for Large Vision-Language Models that reformulates reasoning as posterior inference using amortized variational inference and diversity-seeking RL with sparse rewards, improving performance on reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training methods like SFT, PPO, and GRPO don't generalize well across unseen reasoning tasks and rely heavily on biased reward models, limiting the interpretability and reliability of LVLMs.

Method: Reformulates reasoning as posterior inference using amortized variational inference, introduces sparse reward functions for token-level learning signals that encourage diverse latent CoT, and implements Bayesian inference-scaling strategy with marginal likelihood for efficient rationale ranking.

Result: Empirically demonstrates enhanced performance on seven reasoning benchmarks, improving state-of-the-art LVLMs in effectiveness, generalization, and interpretability.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses limitations of existing training algorithms by leveraging variational inference and diversity-seeking RL, leading to more robust and interpretable reasoning in LVLMs.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning is critical for improving the
interpretability and reliability of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs).
However, existing training algorithms such as SFT, PPO, and GRPO may not
generalize well across unseen reasoning tasks and heavily rely on a biased
reward model. To address this challenge, we reformulate reasoning in LVLMs as
posterior inference and propose a scalable training algorithm based on
amortized variational inference. By leveraging diversity-seeking reinforcement
learning algorithms, we introduce a novel sparse reward function for
token-level learning signals that encourage diverse, high-likelihood latent
CoT, overcoming deterministic sampling limitations and avoiding reward hacking.
Additionally, we implement a Bayesian inference-scaling strategy that replaces
costly Best-of-N and Beam Search with a marginal likelihood to efficiently rank
optimal rationales and answers. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed
method enhances the state-of-the-art LVLMs on seven reasoning benchmarks, in
terms of effectiveness, generalization, and interpretability.

### [232] [Decentralized Causal Discovery using Judo Calculus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23942)
*Sridhar Mahadevan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A decentralized framework for causal discovery using judo calculus that handles context-dependent causal effects across different regimes through local truth and j-stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal effects in real-world applications depend on context (age, country, dose, etc.), requiring methods that can handle this regime dependence rather than assuming universal causal relationships.

Method: Judo calculus using j-stable causal inference with j-do-calculus in a topos of sheaves, combined with standard causal discovery methods (score-based, constraint-based, gradient-based).

Result: Experimental results show computational efficiency from decentralized sheaf-theoretic approach and improved performance over classical causal discovery methods on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Judo calculus provides a formal framework for context-dependent causal discovery that is both computationally efficient and outperforms traditional methods by leveraging local truth across regimes.

Abstract: We describe a theory and implementation of an intuitionistic decentralized
framework for causal discovery using judo calculus, which is formally defined
as j-stable causal inference using j-do-calculus in a topos of sheaves. In
real-world applications -- from biology to medicine and social science --
causal effects depend on regime (age, country, dose, genotype, or lab
protocol). Our proposed judo calculus formalizes this context dependence
formally as local truth: a causal claim is proven true on a cover of regimes,
not everywhere at once. The Lawvere-Tierney modal operator j chooses which
regimes are relevant; j-stability means the claim holds constructively and
consistently across that family. We describe an algorithmic and implementation
framework for judo calculus, combining it with standard score-based,
constraint-based, and gradient-based causal discovery methods. We describe
experimental results on a range of domains, from synthetic to real-world
datasets from biology and economics. Our experimental results show the
computational efficiency gained by the decentralized nature of sheaf-theoretic
causal discovery, as well as improved performance over classical causal
discovery methods.

*Aymane El Gadarri,Ali Aouad,Vivek F. Farias*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The sign estimator replaces cross-entropy with binary classification loss in LLM alignment, providing consistent ordinal alignment and reducing preference distortion compared to standard RLHF methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LLM alignment methods are vulnerable to heterogeneity in human preferences and yield inconsistent estimates of population-average utility when using pairwise comparison data.

Method: Proposes the sign estimator that replaces cross-entropy with binary classification loss in the aggregation step, providing a simple, provably consistent, and efficient estimator for LLM alignment.

Result: In simulations using digital twins, the sign estimator reduces preference distortion by cutting angular estimation error by nearly 35% and decreasing disagreement with true population preferences from 12% to 8% compared to standard RLHF.

Conclusion: The sign estimator achieves consistent ordinal alignment under mild assumptions, provides polynomial finite-sample error bounds, and outperforms panel data heuristics while maintaining implementation simplicity of existing LLM alignment pipelines.

Abstract: Traditional LLM alignment methods are vulnerable to heterogeneity in human
preferences. Fitting a na\"ive probabilistic model to pairwise comparison data
(say over prompt-completion pairs) yields an inconsistent estimate of the
population-average utility -a canonical measure of social welfare. We propose a
new method, dubbed the sign estimator, that provides a simple, provably
consistent, and efficient estimator by replacing cross-entropy with binary
classification loss in the aggregation step. This simple modification recovers
consistent ordinal alignment under mild assumptions and achieves the first
polynomial finite-sample error bounds in this setting. In realistic simulations
of LLM alignment using digital twins, the sign estimator substantially reduces
preference distortion over a panel of simulated personas, cutting (angular)
estimation error by nearly 35% and decreasing disagreement with true population
preferences from 12% to 8% compared to standard RLHF. Our method also compares
favorably to panel data heuristics that explicitly model user heterogeneity and
require tracking individual-level preference data-all while maintaining the
implementation simplicity of existing LLM alignment pipelines.

### [234] [Learning Individual Movement Shifts After Urban Disruptions with Social Infrastructure Reliance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23989)
*Shangde Gao,Zelin Xu,Zhe Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper develops a conditioned deep learning model that incorporates individuals' social infrastructure resilience (SIR) and spatial context to predict post-event movement pattern shifts using sparse individual-level data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting individual movement pattern shifts after disruptive events is challenging due to: lack of SIR measures, insufficient capture of movement-spatial context interactions, and sparse individual data unsuitable for traditional prediction methods.

Method: A conditioned deep learning model that incorporates individuals' SIR and captures complex relationships between movement patterns and local spatial context using large-scale, sparse individual-level data.

Result: Experiments show that incorporating SIR and spatial context enhances the model's ability to predict post-event movement patterns. The model captures divergent shifts among individuals with similar pre-event patterns but different SIR.

Conclusion: The conditioned deep learning model successfully predicts individual movement pattern shifts after disruptive events by incorporating social infrastructure resilience and spatial context factors.

Abstract: Shifts in individual movement patterns following disruptive events can reveal
changing demands for community resources. However, predicting such shifts
before disruptive events remains challenging for several reasons. First,
measures are lacking for individuals' heterogeneous social infrastructure
resilience (SIR), which directly influences their movement patterns, and
commonly used features are often limited or unavailable at scale, e.g.,
sociodemographic characteristics. Second, the complex interactions between
individual movement patterns and spatial contexts have not been sufficiently
captured. Third, individual-level movement may be spatially sparse and not
well-suited to traditional decision-making methods for movement predictions.
This study incorporates individuals' SIR into a conditioned deep learning model
to capture the complex relationships between individual movement patterns and
local spatial context using large-scale, sparse individual-level data. Our
experiments demonstrate that incorporating individuals' SIR and spatial context
can enhance the model's ability to predict post-event individual movement
patterns. The conditioned model can capture the divergent shifts in movement
patterns among individuals who exhibit similar pre-event patterns but differ in
SIR.

TL;DR: LLM-discovered heuristics EDDC and MDDC outperform traditional methods for single-machine total tardiness scheduling, showing human-LLM collaboration can create scalable solutions for NP-hard problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage LLMs for discovering novel heuristics in combinatorial optimization, specifically for the NP-hard single-machine total tardiness problem where traditional exact methods become intractable for large instances.

Method: Developed two LLM-discovered heuristics (EDDC and MDDC) inspired by EDD and MDD rules, benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods using MIP formulation, optimality gaps, and solution time across job sizes from 20 to 500.

Result: EDDC improved upon classic EDD rule and other algorithms up to 500 jobs. MDDC consistently outperformed traditional heuristics and remained competitive with exact approaches, especially on larger instances.

Conclusion: Human-LLM collaboration can produce scalable, high-performing heuristics for NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems even with limited resources when properly configured.

Abstract: Our study contributes to the scheduling and combinatorial optimization
literature with new heuristics discovered by leveraging the power of Large
Language Models (LLMs). We focus on the single-machine total tardiness (SMTT)
problem, which aims to minimize total tardiness by sequencing n jobs on a
single processor without preemption, given processing times and due dates. We
develop and benchmark two novel LLM-discovered heuristics, the EDD Challenger
(EDDC) and MDD Challenger (MDDC), inspired by the well-known Earliest Due Date
(EDD) and Modified Due Date (MDD) rules. In contrast to prior studies that
employed simpler rule-based heuristics, we evaluate our LLM-discovered
algorithms using rigorous criteria, including optimality gaps and solution time
derived from a mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation of SMTT. We compare
their performance against state-of-the-art heuristics and exact methods across
various job sizes (20, 100, 200, and 500 jobs). For instances with more than
100 jobs, exact methods such as MIP and dynamic programming become
computationally intractable. Up to 500 jobs, EDDC improves upon the classic EDD
rule and another widely used algorithm in the literature. MDDC consistently
outperforms traditional heuristics and remains competitive with exact
approaches, particularly on larger and more complex instances. This study shows
that human-LLM collaboration can produce scalable, high-performing heuristics
for NP-hard constrained combinatorial optimization, even under limited
resources when effectively configured.

*Tingyue Pan,Mingyue Cheng,Shilong Zhang,Zhiding Liu,Xiaoyu Tao,Yucong Luo,Jintao Zhang,Qi Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OneCast is a modular forecasting framework that decomposes time series into seasonal and trend components, using specialized generative pathways for each component to achieve better cross-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with domain-specific trend shifts and inconsistent periodic patterns when forecasting across heterogeneous time series domains, due to treating temporal series as undifferentiated sequences without explicit structural decomposition.

Method: OneCast decomposes time series into seasonal and trend components. Seasonal patterns are captured via lightweight projection with interpretable basis functions. Trend components are encoded into discrete tokens using semantic-aware tokenization and inferred through masked discrete diffusion. Both outputs are combined for final forecasts.

Result: Extensive experiments across eight domains demonstrate that OneCast mostly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in cross-domain time series forecasting.

Conclusion: The proposed structured decomposition approach with tailored generative pathways for seasonal and trend components effectively addresses cross-domain generalization challenges in time series forecasting.

Abstract: Cross-domain time series forecasting is a valuable task in various web
applications. Despite its rapid advancement, achieving effective generalization
across heterogeneous time series data remains a significant challenge. Existing
methods have made progress by extending single-domain models, yet often fall
short when facing domain-specific trend shifts and inconsistent periodic
patterns. We argue that a key limitation lies in treating temporal series as
undifferentiated sequence, without explicitly decoupling their inherent
structural components. To address this, we propose OneCast, a structured and
modular forecasting framework that decomposes time series into seasonal and
trend components, each modeled through tailored generative pathways.
Specifically, the seasonal component is captured by a lightweight projection
module that reconstructs periodic patterns via interpretable basis functions.
In parallel, the trend component is encoded into discrete tokens at segment
level via a semantic-aware tokenizer, and subsequently inferred through a
masked discrete diffusion mechanism. The outputs from both branches are
combined to produce a final forecast that captures seasonal patterns while
tracking domain-specific trends. Extensive experiments across eight domains
demonstrate that OneCast mostly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: System log analysis is crucial for cybersecurity but challenging due to high costs, lack of expertise, and time constraints. Existing approaches struggle with analyzing vast amounts of diverse log data effectively.

Method: Uses a modular architecture with router, log recognizer, log parser, and search tools. Combines LLMs with ML algorithms to address LLM limitations like context window constraints and poor structured text handling.

Result: Achieved 39-68% performance improvements over state-of-the-art LLM chatbots (ChatGPT, ChatPDF, NotebookLM) across various tasks. Showed strong robustness with 93% reduction in interquartile range using ROUGE-1 scores.

Conclusion: LLMLogAnalyzer effectively enhances LLM capabilities for structured text analysis, improving accuracy and robustness in log analysis tasks, making it valuable for both cybersecurity experts and non-technical users.

Abstract: System logs are a cornerstone of cybersecurity, supporting proactive breach
prevention and post-incident investigations. However, analyzing vast amounts of
diverse log data remains significantly challenging, as high costs, lack of
in-house expertise, and time constraints make even basic analysis difficult for
many organizations. This study introduces LLMLogAnalyzer, a clustering-based
log analysis chatbot that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Machine
Learning (ML) algorithms to simplify and streamline log analysis processes.
This innovative approach addresses key LLM limitations, including context
window constraints and poor structured text handling capabilities, enabling
more effective summarization, pattern extraction, and anomaly detection tasks.
LLMLogAnalyzer is evaluated across four distinct domain logs and various tasks.
Results demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art
LLM-based chatbots, including ChatGPT, ChatPDF, and NotebookLM, with consistent
gains ranging from 39% to 68% across different tasks. The system also exhibits
strong robustness, achieving a 93% reduction in interquartile range (IQR) when
using ROUGE-1 scores, indicating significantly lower result variability. The
framework's effectiveness stems from its modular architecture comprising a
router, log recognizer, log parser, and search tools. This design enhances LLM
capabilities for structured text analysis while improving accuracy and
robustness, making it a valuable resource for both cybersecurity experts and
non-technical users.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study compares classical physics-based models and machine learning (Random Forest) for electric vehicle car-following behavior, showing Random Forest's superior accuracy across various gap scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding EV driving behavior is crucial for traffic safety and developing smart driving systems as electric vehicle adoption increases.

Method: Compared classical models (IDM, OVM, OVRV, simplified CACC) calibrated using RMSE minimization with a Random Forest Regressor using spacing, speed, and gap type inputs on real-world EV following ICE vehicle data.

Result: Random Forest achieved best performance with RMSEs of 0.0046 (medium gap), 0.0016 (long gap), and 0.0025 (extra long gap), while CACC was the best classical model with RMSE of 2.67 for long gaps.

Conclusion: Machine learning models outperform physics-based models for EV car-following behavior simulation and are valuable for analyzing mixed autonomy traffic dynamics in EV-integrated environments.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) necessitates an
understanding of their driving behavior to enhance traffic safety and develop
smart driving systems. This study compares classical and machine learning
models for EV car following behavior. Classical models include the Intelligent
Driver Model (IDM), Optimum Velocity Model (OVM), Optimal Velocity Relative
Velocity (OVRV), and a simplified CACC model, while the machine learning
approach employs a Random Forest Regressor. Using a real world dataset of an EV
following an internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle under varied driving
conditions, we calibrated classical model parameters by minimizing the RMSE
between predictions and real data. The Random Forest model predicts
acceleration using spacing, speed, and gap type as inputs. Results demonstrate
the Random Forest's superior accuracy, achieving RMSEs of 0.0046 (medium gap),
0.0016 (long gap), and 0.0025 (extra long gap). Among physics based models,
CACC performed best, with an RMSE of 2.67 for long gaps. These findings
highlight the machine learning model's performance across all scenarios. Such
models are valuable for simulating EV behavior and analyzing mixed autonomy
traffic dynamics in EV integrated environments.

*Sandeep Vissapragada,Vikrant Sahu,Gagan Raj Gupta,Vandita Singh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HistoLens is a transparent AI system that allows pathologists to ask questions about tissue slides in plain English and receive clear reports with visual explanations, maintaining the pathologist as the expert in charge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build trust in AI by making it transparent and collaborative rather than a black box, allowing doctors to understand the AI's reasoning like consulting a colleague.

Method: Created a system that translates plain English questions into precise AI queries, provides structured reports with visual proofs (heatmaps), and teaches AI to focus only on relevant tissue while ignoring background noise.

Result: A workflow where pathologists can use the AI assistant to verify insights and make faster, more confident diagnoses while remaining in control.

Conclusion: HistoLens successfully creates a trustworthy AI partnership that maintains the pathologist's expertise while enhancing diagnostic confidence and efficiency through transparent reasoning.

Abstract: For doctors to truly trust artificial intelligence, it can't be a black box.
They need to understand its reasoning, almost as if they were consulting a
colleague. We created HistoLens1 to be that transparent, collaborative partner.
It allows a pathologist to simply ask a question in plain English about a
tissue slide--just as they would ask a trainee. Our system intelligently
translates this question into a precise query for its AI engine, which then
provides a clear, structured report. But it doesn't stop there. If a doctor
ever asks, "Why?", HistoLens can instantly provide a 'visual proof' for any
finding--a heatmap that points to the exact cells and regions the AI used for
its analysis. We've also ensured the AI focuses only on the patient's tissue,
just like a trained pathologist would, by teaching it to ignore distracting
background noise. The result is a workflow where the pathologist remains the
expert in charge, using a trustworthy AI assistant to verify their insights and
make faster, more confident diagnoses.

*Yu Luo,Jiamin Jiang,Jingfei Feng,Lei Tao,Qingliang Zhang,Xidao Wen,Yongqian Sun,Shenglin Zhang,Jielong Huang,Nan Qi,Dan Pei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OpsAgent is a lightweight, self-evolving multi-agent system for incident management that converts heterogeneous observability data into structured descriptions and uses multi-agent collaboration for transparent diagnostic inference with dual self-evolution mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual incident management is labor-intensive and error-prone with massive observability data, while existing automated approaches struggle with generalization, interpretability, and high deployment costs.

Method: Uses training-free data processor to convert heterogeneous observability data into structured textual descriptions, multi-agent collaboration framework for transparent diagnostic inference, and dual self-evolution mechanism for continual capability growth.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on OPENRCA benchmark, demonstrating generalizability, interpretability, cost-efficiency, and self-evolution capabilities.

Conclusion: OpsAgent is a practically deployable and sustainable solution for long-term operation in real-world cloud systems.

Abstract: Incident management (IM) is central to the reliability of large-scale cloud
systems. Yet manual IM, where on-call engineers examine metrics, logs, and
traces is labor-intensive and error-prone in the face of massive and
heterogeneous observability data. Existing automated IM approaches often
struggle to generalize across systems, provide limited interpretability, and
incur high deployment costs, which hinders adoption in practice. In this paper,
we present OpsAgent, a lightweight, self-evolving multi-agent system for IM
that employs a training-free data processor to convert heterogeneous
observability data into structured textual descriptions, along with a
multi-agent collaboration framework that makes diagnostic inference transparent
and auditable. To support continual capability growth, OpsAgent also introduces
a dual self-evolution mechanism that integrates internal model updates with
external experience accumulation, thereby closing the deployment loop.
Comprehensive experiments on the OPENRCA benchmark demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance and show that OpsAgent is generalizable, interpretable,
cost-efficient, and self-evolving, making it a practically deployable and
sustainable solution for long-term operation in real-world cloud systems.

### [241] [BMGQ: A Bottom-up Method for Generating Complex Multi-hop Reasoning Questions from Semi-structured Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24151)
*Bingsen Qiu,Zijian Liu,Xiao Liu,Haoshen Yang,Zeren Gao,Bingjie Wang,Feier Zhang,Yixuan Qin,Chunyan Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Automated framework for generating high-difficulty multi-hop QA datasets from semi-structured knowledge, using NLI-based relation typing, reverse question construction, and quality evaluation pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-hop QA datasets are scarce, mostly designed for evaluation rather than training, and manual curation is too expensive and doesn't scale, creating a data bottleneck for training retrieval-and-reasoning agents.

Method: Three-step process: (1) NLI-based relation typing and diversity-aware expansion for evidence clusters, (2) reverse question construction to create oblique cues, (3) two-step quality evaluation with multi-model consensus filtering and constraint decomposition.

Result: Scalable process that generates complex, retrieval-resistant yet verifiable questions suitable for both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning training.

Conclusion: The framework substantially reduces human curation effort while preserving the difficulty profile of strong evaluation benchmarks, addressing the critical data bottleneck in training high-capability retrieval-and-reasoning agents.

Abstract: Building training-ready multi-hop question answering (QA) datasets that truly
stress a model's retrieval and reasoning abilities remains highly challenging
recently. While there have been a few recent evaluation datasets that capture
the characteristics of hard-to-search but easy-to-verify problems -- requiring
the integration of ambiguous, indirect, and cross-domain cues -- these data
resources remain scarce and are mostly designed for evaluation, making them
unsuitable for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL).
Meanwhile, manually curating non-trivially retrievable questions -- where
answers cannot be found through a single direct query but instead require
multi-hop reasoning over oblique and loosely connected evidence -- incurs
prohibitive human costs and fails to scale, creating a critical data bottleneck
for training high-capability retrieval-and-reasoning agents.
  To address this, we present an automated framework for generating
high-difficulty, training-ready multi-hop questions from semi-structured
knowledge sources. The system (i) grows diverse, logically labeled evidence
clusters through Natural Language Inference (NLI)-based relation typing and
diversity-aware expansion; (ii) applies reverse question construction to
compose oblique cues so that isolated signals are underinformative but their
combination uniquely identifies the target entity; and (iii) enforces quality
with a two-step evaluation pipeline that combines multi-model consensus
filtering with structured constraint decomposition and evidence-based matching.
The result is a scalable process that yields complex, retrieval-resistant yet
verifiable questions suitable for SFT/RL training as well as challenging
evaluation, substantially reducing human curation effort while preserving the
difficulty profile of strong evaluation benchmarks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BLM₁ is a multimodal spatial foundation model that unifies digital-physical reasoning and cross-embodiment control, outperforming existing models by ~6% in digital tasks and ~3% in physical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs, VLAs, and ELLMs have limitations in generalizing across digital-physical spaces, embodiments, and lack robust high-level embodied reasoning, creating a need for unified models.

Method: Two-stage training: Stage I injects embodied knowledge into MLLM while maintaining language competence; Stage II trains policy module via intent-bridging interface that extracts high-level semantics from MLLM without fine-tuning backbone.

Result: Single BLM₁ instance outperforms four model families (MLLMs, ELLMs, VLAs, GMLMs) with ~6% gains in digital tasks and ~3% in physical tasks across digital and physical benchmarks.

Conclusion: BLM₁ successfully integrates cross-space transfer, cross-task learning, and cross-embodiment generalization, providing a unified model for seamless operation across digital and physical spaces.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced vision-language
reasoning and are increasingly deployed in embodied agents. However,
significant limitations remain: MLLMs generalize poorly across digital-physical
spaces and embodiments; vision-language-action models (VLAs) produce low-level
actions yet lack robust high-level embodied reasoning; and most embodied large
language models (ELLMs) are constrained to digital-space with poor
generalization to the physical world. Thus, unified models that operate
seamlessly across digital and physical spaces while generalizing across
embodiments and tasks remain absent. We introduce the \textbf{Boundless Large
Model (BLM$_1$)}, a multimodal spatial foundation model that preserves
instruction following and reasoning, incorporates embodied knowledge, and
supports robust cross-embodiment control. BLM$_1$ integrates three key
capabilities -- \textit{cross-space transfer, cross-task learning, and
cross-embodiment generalization} -- via a two-stage training paradigm. Stage I
injects embodied knowledge into the MLLM through curated digital corpora while
maintaining language competence. Stage II trains a policy module through an
intent-bridging interface that extracts high-level semantics from the MLLM to
guide control, without fine-tuning the MLLM backbone. This process is supported
by a self-collected cross-embodiment demonstration suite spanning four robot
embodiments and six progressively challenging tasks. Evaluations across digital
and physical benchmarks show that a single BLM$_1$ instance outperforms four
model families -- MLLMs, ELLMs, VLAs, and GMLMs -- achieving
$\sim\!\textbf{6%}$ gains in digital tasks and $\sim\!\textbf{3%}$ in physical
tasks.

### [243] [UniPlanner: A Unified Motion Planning Framework for Autonomous Vehicle Decision-Making Systems via Multi-Dataset Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24166)
*Xin Yang,Yuhang Zhang,Wei Li,Xin Lin,Wenbin Zou,Chen Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UniPlanner is a unified motion planning framework that enables multi-dataset integration for autonomous vehicles through three key innovations: HFTDN for cross-dataset planning guidance, GFTM for robust history-future correlations, and S2D paradigm for adaptive prior utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning approaches for motion planning are limited to single-dataset training, which restricts their robustness in real-world autonomous driving scenarios where diverse data sources are available.

Method: Proposes three synergistic components: 1) HFTDN aggregates trajectory pairs from multiple datasets using historical similarity for cross-dataset guidance, 2) GFTM learns robust history-future correlations with gradient-free design to prevent shortcut learning, 3) S2D paradigm uses adaptive dropout during training and full prior utilization during inference.

Result: The framework discovers that vehicular trajectory distributions and history-future correlations show remarkable consistency across different datasets, enabling unified cross-dataset learning for improved planning robustness.

Conclusion: UniPlanner represents the first planning framework designed for multi-dataset integration in autonomous vehicle decision-making, addressing the limitations of single-dataset approaches and enabling more robust motion planning through cross-dataset knowledge transfer.

Abstract: Motion planning is a critical component of autonomous vehicle decision-making
systems, directly determining trajectory safety and driving efficiency. While
deep learning approaches have advanced planning capabilities, existing methods
remain confined to single-dataset training, limiting their robustness in
planning.
  Through systematic analysis, we discover that vehicular trajectory
distributions and history-future correlations demonstrate remarkable
consistency across different datasets. Based on these findings, we propose
UniPlanner, the first planning framework designed for multi-dataset integration
in autonomous vehicle decision-making. UniPlanner achieves unified
cross-dataset learning through three synergistic innovations.
  First, the History-Future Trajectory Dictionary Network (HFTDN) aggregates
history-future trajectory pairs from multiple datasets, using historical
trajectory similarity to retrieve relevant futures and generate cross-dataset
planning guidance.
  Second, the Gradient-Free Trajectory Mapper (GFTM) learns robust
history-future correlations from multiple datasets, transforming historical
trajectories into universal planning priors. Its gradient-free design ensures
the introduction of valuable priors while preventing shortcut learning, making
the planning knowledge safely transferable. Third, the Sparse-to-Dense (S2D)
paradigm implements adaptive dropout to selectively suppress planning priors
during training for robust learning, while enabling full prior utilization
during inference to maximize planning performance.

### [244] [MGA: Memory-Driven GUI Agent for Observation-Centric Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24168)
*Weihua Cheng,Ersheng Ni,Wenlong Wang,Yifei Sun,Junming Liu,Wangyu Shen,Yirong Chen,Botian Shi,Ding Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MGA is a memory-driven GUI agent that uses an 'observe first, then decide' approach with structured memory to improve robustness and generalization in GUI interactions, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI agents suffer from error propagation due to dependence on historical trajectories and local exploration bias from 'decision-first, observation-later' mechanisms that overlook critical interface cues.

Method: MGA reframes GUI interaction around 'observe first, then decide' principle, modeling each step as an independent state with current screenshot, task-agnostic spatial information, and dynamically updated structured memory.

Result: Experiments on OSworld benchmarks, real desktop applications (Chrome, VSCode, VLC), and cross-task transfer show MGA achieves substantial gains in robustness, generalization, and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The memory-driven approach with structured representation enables more effective GUI agents that overcome limitations of existing trajectory-dependent methods.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal
extensions (MLLMs) has enabled agentic systems capable of perceiving and acting
across diverse environments. A challenging yet impactful frontier is the
development of GUI agents, which must navigate complex desktop and web
interfaces while maintaining robustness and generalization. Existing paradigms
typically model tasks as long-chain executions, concatenating historical
trajectories into the context. While approaches such as Mirage and GTA1 refine
planning or introduce multi-branch action selection, they remain constrained by
two persistent issues: Dependence on historical trajectories, which amplifies
error propagation. And Local exploration bias, where "decision-first,
observation-later" mechanisms overlook critical interface cues. We introduce
the Memory-Driven GUI Agent (MGA), which reframes GUI interaction around the
principle of observe first, then decide. MGA models each step as an
independent, context-rich environment state represented by a triad: current
screenshot, task-agnostic spatial information, and a dynamically updated
structured memory. Experiments on OSworld benchmarks, real desktop applications
(Chrome, VSCode, VLC), and cross-task transfer demonstrate that MGA achieves
substantial gains in robustness, generalization, and efficiency compared to
state-of-the-art baselines. The code is publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs have limited ability to utilize the rapidly expanding MCP ecosystem due to few covered servers, costly manual curation, and lack of training support, hindering real-world deployment.

Method: MCP-Flow uses an automated web-agent-driven pipeline for server discovery and data synthesis, collecting data from 1166 servers and 11536 tools to produce instruction-function call pairs and trajectories.

Conclusion: MCP-Flow provides a scalable foundation for advancing LLM agents' proficiency in real-world MCP environments, with the system being publicly available.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on external tools to perform
complex, realistic tasks, yet their ability to utilize the rapidly expanding
Model Contextual Protocol (MCP) ecosystem remains limited. Existing MCP
research covers few servers, depends on costly manual curation, and lacks
training support, hindering progress toward real-world deployment. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce MCP-Flow, an automated web-agent-driven

MCP-Flow collects and filters data from 1166 servers and 11536 tools, producing
68733 high-quality instruction-function call pairs and 6439 trajectories, far
exceeding prior work in scale and diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate
MCP-Flow's effectiveness in driving superior MCP tool selection, function-call

*Robin Schmöcker,Alexander Dockhorn,Bodo Rosenhahn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses a weakness in MCTS where abstractions can cause multiple actions to have identical UCB values, requiring tie-breaking. It proposes and evaluates alternative intra-abstraction policies that outperform random tie-breaking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) sample efficiency by addressing the issue where state/action abstractions cause multiple actions to share the same UCB value, requiring effective tie-breaking mechanisms.

Method: Proposed and empirically evaluated several alternative intra-abstraction policies for handling tie-breaking when multiple actions in the same abstract node have identical UCB values.

Result: Several of the proposed intra-abstraction policies outperformed the random tie-breaking policy across a majority of environments and parameter settings.

Conclusion: Alternative intra-abstraction policies can effectively address the tie-breaking problem in MCTS abstractions and improve performance over random tie-breaking.

Abstract: One weakness of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is its sample efficiency which
can be addressed by building and using state and/or action abstractions in
parallel to the tree search such that information can be shared among nodes of
the same layer. The primary usage of abstractions for MCTS is to enhance the
Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) value during the tree policy by aggregating visits
and returns of an abstract node. However, this direct usage of abstractions
does not take the case into account where multiple actions with the same parent
might be in the same abstract node, as these would then all have the same UCB
value, thus requiring a tiebreak rule. In state-of-the-art abstraction
algorithms such as pruned On the Go Abstractions (pruned OGA), this case has
not been noticed, and a random tiebreak rule was implicitly chosen. In this
paper, we propose and empirically evaluate several alternative
intra-abstraction policies, several of which outperform the random policy
across a majority of environments and parameter settings.

### [247] [Verifying Large Language Models' Reasoning Paths via Correlation Matrix Rank](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24299)
*Jiayu Liu,Wei Dai,Zhenya Huang,Ning Miao,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Self-Indicator, a method that uses the correlation matrix rank between input problems and output reasoning paths as an indicator of reasoning correctness in LLMs, achieving significant performance improvements with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for checking LLM outputs rely heavily on external resources like trained verifiers or elaborate prompts, leading to high computational costs and domain-specific limitations. The paper investigates whether LLMs' internal behaviors can indicate reasoning credibility without external dependencies.

Method: The method calculates the rank of the correlation matrix between input problems and output reasoning paths as an indicator of reasoning correctness. This correlation matrix calculation only relies on the LLM itself, avoiding the need for separate model training or complex prompts.

Result: Self-Indicator achieves over 75% accuracy in distinguishing correct reasoning paths from incorrect ones and improves accuracies on three reasoning benchmarks by more than 8%. It outperforms other voting and verification methods with very few computational overhead.

Conclusion: The internal behaviors of LLMs, specifically the correlation matrix rank between inputs and reasoning paths, serve as a robust indicator of reasoning correctness. Self-Indicator provides an effective, plug-and-play solution that works across multiple LLM scales and families without external dependencies.

Abstract: Despite the strong reasoning ability of large language models~(LLMs), they
are prone to errors and hallucinations. As a result, how to check their outputs
effectively and efficiently has become a critical problem in their
applications. Existing checking methods heavily rely on external resources,
such as trained verifiers (e.g., process/outcome reward models) or elaborate
prompts, which lead to high computational overhead and are only applicable to
specific domains. In this paper, we investigate whether the internal behaviors
of LLMs have already implied the credibility of their reasoning paths.
Specifically, we find that the rank of the correlation matrix between the input
problem and the output reasoning path is a robust indicator of reasoning
correctness. Different from other correctness indicators for LLMs, the
calculation of the correlation matrix only relies on the LLM itself, which
avoids the hassle of training a separate model or designing complicated
prompts. Based on it, we design a simple, plug-and-play Self-Indicator method
to reweight candidate reasoning paths, which achieves significant performance
improvements than other voting and verification methods with very few
computational overhead. Our experiments across multiple LLMs of varying scales
and model families have further shown the effectiveness of Self-Indicator. It
achieves over 75% accuracy in distinguishing correct reasoning paths from
incorrect ones, and, in turn, improves the accuracies on three reasoning
benchmarks by more than 8%.

*Deniz Gorur,Antoni Rago,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent framework for claim verification using LLM-powered agents that generate quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks (QBAFs) to assess claim plausibility, with experiments showing improved forecasting accuracy through evidence combination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve judgmental forecasting by treating it as claim verification where different agents can disagree and provide evidence for/against claims, enabling explainable combination of diverse evidence sources.

Method: Proposed multi-agent framework with three types of LLM-powered agents: ArgLLM (existing QBAF generation), RbAM (relation-based argument mining from external sources), and RAG-ArgLLM (RAG-enhanced ArgLLM). Experiments used 2-3 agents with 6 different base LLMs on standard judgmental forecasting datasets.

Result: Combining evidence from multiple agents improved forecasting accuracy, particularly with three agents, while providing explainable evidence combinations for claim verification.

Conclusion: Multi-agent frameworks with LLM-powered agents can effectively combine diverse evidence sources to enhance judgmental forecasting accuracy and provide explainable claim verification through quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks.

Abstract: Judgmental forecasting is the task of making predictions about future events
based on human judgment. This task can be seen as a form of claim verification,
where the claim corresponds to a future event and the task is to assess the
plausibility of that event. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent
framework for claim verification, whereby different agents may disagree on
claim veracity and bring specific evidence for and against the claims,
represented as quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks (QBAFs). We then
instantiate the framework for supporting claim verification, with a variety of
agents realised with Large Language Models (LLMs): (1) ArgLLM agents, an
existing approach for claim verification that generates and evaluates QBAFs;
(2) RbAM agents, whereby LLM-empowered Relation-based Argument Mining (RbAM)
from external sources is used to generate QBAFs; (3) RAG-ArgLLM agents,
extending ArgLLM agents with a form of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) of
arguments from external sources. Finally, we conduct experiments with two
standard judgmental forecasting datasets, with instances of our framework with
two or three agents, empowered by six different base LLMs. We observe that
combining evidence from agents can improve forecasting accuracy, especially in
the case of three agents, while providing an explainable combination of
evidence for claim verification.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: gLLMs like ChatGPT are transforming communication research by outperforming human coders in content analysis tasks with greater efficiency and lower costs, but require addressing seven key challenges for proper implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make gLLM-assisted quantitative content analysis more accessible to communication researchers while ensuring adherence to disciplinary quality standards of validity, reliability, reproducibility, and research ethics.

Method: Synthesizes emerging research on gLLM-assisted quantitative content analysis and proposes a comprehensive best-practice guide addressing seven critical challenges: codebook development, prompt engineering, model selection, parameter tuning, iterative refinement, validation of reliability, and optional performance enhancement.

Result: The paper provides a framework for integrating gLLMs into communication research methodology, highlighting their advantages in decoding implicit meanings, natural language instruction, ease of deployment, and minimal data requirements.

Conclusion: gLLMs represent a paradigm shift in automated content analysis for communication science, but their successful integration requires systematic approaches to address methodological challenges and maintain research quality standards.

Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (gLLMs), such as ChatGPT, are increasingly
being used in communication research for content analysis. Studies show that
gLLMs can outperform both crowd workers and trained coders, such as research
assistants, on various coding tasks relevant to communication science, often at
a fraction of the time and cost. Additionally, gLLMs can decode implicit
meanings and contextual information, be instructed using natural language,
deployed with only basic programming skills, and require little to no annotated
data beyond a validation dataset - constituting a paradigm shift in automated
content analysis. Despite their potential, the integration of gLLMs into the
methodological toolkit of communication research remains underdeveloped. In
gLLM-assisted quantitative content analysis, researchers must address at least
seven critical challenges that impact result quality: (1) codebook development,
(2) prompt engineering, (3) model selection, (4) parameter tuning, (5)
iterative refinement, (6) validation of the model's reliability, and
optionally, (7) performance enhancement. This paper synthesizes emerging
research on gLLM-assisted quantitative content analysis and proposes a
comprehensive best-practice guide to navigate these challenges. Our goal is to
make gLLM-based content analysis more accessible to a broader range of
communication researchers and ensure adherence to established disciplinary
quality standards of validity, reliability, reproducibility, and research
ethics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-driven data science systems lack guidance from scientific principles, limiting their trustworthiness and robustness with real-world noisy datasets.

Method: Multi-agent system implementing modular workflow (data cleaning, feature engineering, modeling, evaluation) with perturbation analysis, unit testing, and model validation guided by PCS principles.

Result: VDSAgents consistently outperformed AutoKaggle and DataInterpreter across nine diverse datasets using DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o backends.

Conclusion: Embedding PCS principles into LLM-driven data science automation is feasible and improves system performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into data science
workflows for automated system design. However, these LLM-driven data science
systems rely solely on the internal reasoning of LLMs, lacking guidance from
scientific and theoretical principles. This limits their trustworthiness and
robustness, especially when dealing with noisy and complex real-world datasets.
This paper provides VDSAgents, a multi-agent system grounded in the
Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) principles proposed in the
Veridical Data Science (VDS) framework. Guided by PCS principles, the system
implements a modular workflow for data cleaning, feature engineering, modeling,
and evaluation. Each phase is handled by an elegant agent, incorporating
perturbation analysis, unit testing, and model validation to ensure both
functionality and scientific auditability. We evaluate VDSAgents on nine
datasets with diverse characteristics, comparing it with state-of-the-art
end-to-end data science systems, such as AutoKaggle and DataInterpreter, using
DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o as backends. VDSAgents consistently outperforms the
results of AutoKaggle and DataInterpreter, which validates the feasibility of
embedding PCS principles into LLM-driven data science automation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Brain-like Space, a unified geometric framework that maps AI models' intrinsic spatial attention organization to human brain networks, enabling comparison across different modalities and revealing brain-likeness patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether AI systems organize information like the human brain, and to create a common ground for comparing AI models across different modalities (vision, language, multimodal) beyond task-specific comparisons.

Method: Developed Brain-like Space concept by mapping AI models' intrinsic spatial attention topological organization onto canonical human functional brain networks. Analyzed 151 Transformer-based models including large vision, language, and multimodal models.

Result: Discovered a continuous arc-shaped geometry in Brain-like Space reflecting gradual increase of brain-likeness. Found that brain-likeness is shaped by pretraining paradigm (global semantic abstraction emphasis) and positional encoding schemes (facilitating cross-modal fusion), not just modality. Brain-likeness and task performance are not identical.

Conclusion: Brain-like Space provides the first unified framework for situating, quantifying, and comparing intelligence across domains, revealing deep organizational principles bridging machines and the brain.

Abstract: For decades, neuroscientists and computer scientists have pursued a shared
ambition: to understand intelligence and build it. Modern artificial neural
networks now rival humans in language, perception, and reasoning, yet it is
still largely unknown whether these artificial systems organize information as
the brain does. Existing brain-AI alignment studies have shown the striking
correspondence between the two systems, but such comparisons remain bound to
specific inputs and tasks, offering no common ground for comparing how AI
models with different kinds of modalities-vision, language, or multimodal-are
intrinsically organized. Here we introduce a groundbreaking concept of
Brain-like Space: a unified geometric space in which every AI model can be
precisely situated and compared by mapping its intrinsic spatial attention
topological organization onto canonical human functional brain networks,
regardless of input modality, task, or sensory domain. Our extensive analysis
of 151 Transformer-based models spanning state-of-the-art large vision models,
large language models, and large multimodal models uncovers a continuous
arc-shaped geometry within this space, reflecting a gradual increase of
brain-likeness; different models exhibit distinct distribution patterns within
this geometry associated with different degrees of brain-likeness, shaped not
merely by their modality but by whether the pretraining paradigm emphasizes
global semantic abstraction and whether the positional encoding scheme
facilitates deep fusion across different modalities. Moreover, the degree of
brain-likeness for a model and its downstream task performance are not
"identical twins". The Brain-like Space provides the first unified framework
for situating, quantifying, and comparing intelligence across domains,
revealing the deep organizational principles that bridge machines and the
brain.

*Pedram Fard,Alaleh Azhir,Neguine Rezaii,Jiazi Tian,Hossein Estiri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent ecosystem for N-of-1 decision support that moves from monolithic AI models to orchestrated intelligence, addressing the 'average patient fallacy' by providing personalized care for rare cases and underrepresented populations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems in medicine serve the average patient well but fail at the margins - patients with rare variants, multimorbidity, or underrepresented demographics. This 'average patient fallacy' erodes equity and trust in medical AI.

Method: A multi-agent ecosystem where agents clustered by organ systems, patient populations, and analytic modalities use shared models and evidence synthesis tools. Results converge in a coordination layer that weighs reliability, uncertainty, and data density to create decision-support packets with risk estimates, confidence ranges, outlier flags, and linked evidence.

Result: Validation shifts from population averages to individual reliability, measured by error in low-density regions, calibration in the small, and risk-coverage trade-offs. The system provides transparent, personalized decision support.

Conclusion: This approach aligns medical AI with the first principle of medicine by providing care that is transparent, equitable, and centered on the individual, addressing challenges like computational demands and regulatory fit through caching, consensus checks, and adaptive trial frameworks.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence in medicine is built to serve the average patient. By
minimizing error across large datasets, most systems deliver strong aggregate
accuracy yet falter at the margins: patients with rare variants,
multimorbidity, or underrepresented demographics. This average patient fallacy
erodes both equity and trust. We propose a different design: a multi-agent
ecosystem for N-of-1 decision support. In this environment, agents clustered by
organ systems, patient populations, and analytic modalities draw on a shared
library of models and evidence synthesis tools. Their results converge in a
coordination layer that weighs reliability, uncertainty, and data density
before presenting the clinician with a decision-support packet: risk estimates
bounded by confidence ranges, outlier flags, and linked evidence. Validation
shifts from population averages to individual reliability, measured by error in
low-density regions, calibration in the small, and risk--coverage trade-offs.
Anticipated challenges include computational demands, automation bias, and
regulatory fit, addressed through caching strategies, consensus checks, and
adaptive trial frameworks. By moving from monolithic models to orchestrated
intelligence, this approach seeks to align medical AI with the first principle
of medicine: care that is transparent, equitable, and centered on the
individual.

TL;DR: Policy Cards are a machine-readable standard for expressing operational, regulatory, and ethical constraints for AI agents, enabling runtime enforcement and verifiable compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for practical mechanisms to integrate high-level governance with engineering practice for autonomous AI agents, enabling accountable autonomy at scale.

Method: Introduces Policy Cards as deployment-layer artifacts that encode allow/deny rules, obligations, evidentiary requirements, and crosswalk mappings to assurance frameworks like NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 42001, and EU AI Act.

Result: Policy Cards can be automatically validated, version-controlled, and linked to runtime enforcement or continuous-audit pipelines, forming a foundation for distributed assurance in multi-agent ecosystems.

Conclusion: Policy Cards provide a practical mechanism for verifiable compliance of autonomous agents, extending existing transparency artifacts with a normative layer that enables accountable autonomy.

Abstract: Policy Cards are introduced as a machine-readable, deployment-layer standard
for expressing operational, regulatory, and ethical constraints for AI agents.
The Policy Card sits with the agent and enables it to follow required
constraints at runtime. It tells the agent what it must and must not do. As
such, it becomes an integral part of the deployed agent. Policy Cards extend
existing transparency artifacts such as Model, Data, and System Cards by
defining a normative layer that encodes allow/deny rules, obligations,
evidentiary requirements, and crosswalk mappings to assurance frameworks
including NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 42001, and the EU AI Act. Each Policy Card can
be validated automatically, version-controlled, and linked to runtime
enforcement or continuous-audit pipelines. The framework enables verifiable
compliance for autonomous agents, forming a foundation for distributed
assurance in multi-agent ecosystems. Policy Cards provide a practical mechanism
for integrating high-level governance with hands-on engineering practice and
enabling accountable autonomy at scale.

### [254] [Improving LLM Reasoning via Dependency-Aware Query Decomposition and Logic-Parallel Content Expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24390)
*Xianjun Gao,Jianchun Liu,Hongli Xu,Liusheng Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Orion is an efficient LLM reasoning framework that uses dependency-aware query decomposition and parallel content expansion to improve both efficiency and quality for real-time web applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM reasoning creates bottlenecks for web services due to inefficient sequential generation and rigid reasoning strategies, failing to meet both low-latency and high-quality requirements.

Method: Orion decomposes queries into two phases: key point generation (retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting) and content parallel expansion (concurrent elaboration based on dependency graphs), with pipeline scheduling for cross-query parallelism.

Result: Experiments show Orion achieves 4.33x higher token generation speed, 3.42x lower answer latency, and 18.75% improvement in reasoning quality compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Orion successfully addresses the dual requirements of efficiency and quality in LLM reasoning for real-time web applications through its novel decomposition and parallelization approach.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into real-time Web
applications, such as AI-powered search and conversational agents, presents a
fundamental Web infrastructure challenge: reconciling the demand for
high-quality, complex reasoning with the stringent low-latency and
high-throughput requirements of interactive services. Current LLM reasoning,
hindered by computationally inefficient sequential generation and rigid
reasoning strategies, creates a critical bottleneck for the Web services.
Existing approaches typically optimize the LLM reasoning for either efficiency
or quality but struggle to achieve both, and thus fail to meet the dual
requirements of modern Web platforms. To overcome these limitations, we propose
Orion, a novel and efficient reasoning framework that enables dependency-aware
query decomposition and logic-parallel content expansion. Concretely, Orion
decomposes a single query reasoning process into two synergistic phases: (1)
\textit{key point generation}, which distills logically structured key points
through retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting, and (2) \textit{content
parallel expansion}, which concurrently elaborates on these points based on a
dependency graph to ensure logical consistency. Furthermore, Orion introduces a
pipeline scheduling mechanism that exploits the complementary computational
characteristics of the two phases (generation imposes pressure on GPU computing
and expansion stresses on GPU memory) across multiple queries, enabling
cross-query parallelism and dramatically improving reasoning performance (\ie,
efficiency and quality). Experiments on diverse benchmarks show that Orion not
only delivers up to 4.33x higher token generation speed and 3.42x lower answer
latency over the baselines but also improves reasoning quality by up to 18.75%
through explicitly modeling inter-point dependencies.

*Jiarui Qin,Yunjia Xi,Junjie Huang,Renting Rui,Di Yin,Weiwen Liu,Yong Yu,Weinan Zhang,Xing Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: APTBench is a new benchmark framework that converts real-world agent tasks into multiple-choice/text completion questions to evaluate agentic capabilities during LLM pre-training, addressing the gap between current pre-training benchmarks and post-training agent evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pre-training benchmarks focus on isolated static skills and fail to assess agentic capabilities, while agent benchmarks require multi-turn execution abilities that base models lack. There's a need for benchmarks that can evaluate agentic potential during pre-training to guide model training more effectively.

Method: APTBench converts real-world agent tasks and successful trajectories into multiple-choice or text completion questions tailored for base models. It focuses on core agentic abilities like planning and action, covering key scenarios in software engineering and deep research.

Result: APTBench provides a more predictive signal of a model's downstream agent performance compared to general-purpose benchmarks, while being significantly more lightweight and cost-effective than full-scale end-to-end agent evaluations after post-training.

Conclusion: APTBench fills a critical gap by enabling evaluation of agentic capabilities during pre-training, offering a practical and efficient alternative to traditional agent benchmarks that require post-trained models.

Abstract: With the rapid development of LLM-based agents, there is a growing trend to
incorporate agent-specific data into the pre-training stage of LLMs, aiming to
better align LLMs with real-world autonomous task execution. However, current
pre-training benchmarks primarily focus on isolated and static skills, e.g.,
common knowledge or mathematical/code reasoning, and fail to reflect model's
agentic capabilities. On the other hand, agent benchmarks are typically
designed for post-trained models, requiring multi-turn task execution abilities
that base models struggle to support. Thus, there is a compelling need for a
benchmark that can evaluate agentic potentials during pre-training and guide
the model training more effectively. To address this gap, we propose APTBench,
a framework that converts real-world agent tasks and successful trajectories
into multiple-choice or text completion questions tailored for base models. It
focuses on core agentic abilities, e.g., planning and action, and covers key
agent scenarios, software engineering and deep research. Compared to existing
general-purpose benchmarks, APTBench offers a more predictive signal of a
model's downstream performance as an agent, while remaining significantly more
lightweight and cost-effective than full-scale, end-to-end agent evaluations
after post-training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Model (VLM) agents show promise for digital automation but pose safety risks like system compromise and privacy leakage. Current methods struggle to detect these risks across complex mobile environments, creating an underexplored research gap.

Method: Proposed OS-Sentinel framework with hybrid approach: Formal Verifier for explicit system-level violations and VLM-based Contextual Judge for contextual risks and agent actions. Built on MobileRisk-Live benchmark with realistic trajectories and fine-grained annotations.

Result: OS-Sentinel achieves 10%-30% improvements over existing approaches across multiple metrics. The framework effectively detects safety concerns in mobile agent operations.

Conclusion: The research establishes foundation for mobile agent safety and provides critical insights for developing safer, more reliable autonomous mobile agents through the proposed hybrid detection framework.

Abstract: Computer-using agents powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have
demonstrated human-like capabilities in operating digital environments like
mobile platforms. While these agents hold great promise for advancing digital
automation, their potential for unsafe operations, such as system compromise
and privacy leakage, is raising significant concerns. Detecting these safety
concerns across the vast and complex operational space of mobile environments
presents a formidable challenge that remains critically underexplored. To
establish a foundation for mobile agent safety research, we introduce
MobileRisk-Live, a dynamic sandbox environment accompanied by a safety
detection benchmark comprising realistic trajectories with fine-grained
annotations. Built upon this, we propose OS-Sentinel, a novel hybrid safety
detection framework that synergistically combines a Formal Verifier for
detecting explicit system-level violations with a VLM-based Contextual Judge
for assessing contextual risks and agent actions. Experiments show that
OS-Sentinel achieves 10%-30% improvements over existing approaches across
multiple metrics. Further analysis provides critical insights that foster the
development of safer and more reliable autonomous mobile agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world legal experiments are costly or infeasible, so simulating legal societies with AI provides an effective alternative for verifying legal theory and supporting legal administration. LLMs with world knowledge and role-playing capabilities are strong candidates for legal system simulation.

Method: Introduces Law in Silico, an LLM-based agent framework for simulating legal scenarios with individual decision-making and institutional mechanisms of legislation, adjudication, and enforcement.

Result: Experiments comparing simulated crime rates with real-world data show LLM-based agents can largely reproduce macro-level crime trends and provide insights aligning with real-world observations. Micro-level simulations reveal that well-functioning, transparent, and adaptive legal systems better protect vulnerable individuals' rights.

Conclusion: LLM-based agents can effectively simulate legal societies, reproducing crime trends and demonstrating that transparent, adaptive legal systems provide better protection for vulnerable individuals.

Abstract: Since real-world legal experiments are often costly or infeasible, simulating
legal societies with Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems provides an effective
alternative for verifying and developing legal theory, as well as supporting
legal administration. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their world knowledge
and role-playing capabilities, are strong candidates to serve as the foundation
for legal society simulation. However, the application of LLMs to simulate
legal systems remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Law in Silico,
an LLM-based agent framework for simulating legal scenarios with individual
decision-making and institutional mechanisms of legislation, adjudication, and
enforcement. Our experiments, which compare simulated crime rates with
real-world data, demonstrate that LLM-based agents can largely reproduce
macro-level crime trends and provide insights that align with real-world
observations. At the same time, micro-level simulations reveal that a
well-functioning, transparent, and adaptive legal system offers better
protection of the rights of vulnerable individuals.

*Habtom Kahsay Gidey,Niklas Huber,Alexander Lenz,Alois Knoll*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A pattern language for constructing actionable world models from structured data, addressing web page complexity and dynamic service integration through DOM transduction and hypermedia affordances recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Software agents need actionable world models from structured data like DOM and web services, but face challenges with HTML verbosity and static API integrations that prevent adaptation to evolving services.

Method: Two architectural patterns: DOM Transduction Pattern distills verbose DOM into compact task-relevant representations, and Hypermedia Affordances Recognition Pattern enables dynamic discovery and integration of unknown web services at runtime.

Result: Provides a robust framework for engineering agents that can efficiently construct and maintain accurate world models from structured data.

Conclusion: These patterns enable scalable, adaptive, and interoperable automation across the web and its extended resources by allowing agents to build actionable world models from complex structured data.

Abstract: The autonomy of software agents is fundamentally dependent on their ability
to construct an actionable internal world model from the structured data that
defines their digital environment, such as the Document Object Model (DOM) of
web pages and the semantic descriptions of web services. However, constructing
this world model from raw structured data presents two critical challenges: the
verbosity of raw HTML makes it computationally intractable for direct use by
foundation models, while the static nature of hardcoded API integrations
prevents agents from adapting to evolving services.
  This paper introduces a pattern language for world modeling from structured
data, presenting two complementary architectural patterns. The DOM Transduction
Pattern addresses the challenge of web page complexity by distilling} a
verbose, raw DOM into a compact, task-relevant representation or world model
optimized for an agent's reasoning core. Concurrently, the Hypermedia
Affordances Recognition Pattern enables the agent to dynamically enrich its
world model by parsing standardized semantic descriptions to discover and
integrate the capabilities of unknown web services at runtime. Together, these
patterns provide a robust framework for engineering agents that can efficiently
construct and maintain an accurate world model, enabling scalable, adaptive,
and interoperable automation across the web and its extended resources.

*Korneel Van den Berghe,Stein Stroobants,Vijay Janapa Reddi,G. C. H. E. de Croon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in training Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for neuromorphic robotic control by analyzing surrogate gradient slopes and proposing a novel training approach with privileged guidance, achieving significant performance improvements in real-world drone control tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNNs offer energy efficiency for robotics but face challenges with non-differentiable spiking neurons requiring surrogate gradients, and stateful dynamics that hinder reinforcement learning due to limited sequence lengths during early training.

Method: Systematically analyzed surrogate gradient slope settings and proposed a novel training approach using a privileged guiding policy to bootstrap learning while maintaining online environment interactions with the spiking policy.

Result: Shallower surrogate gradient slopes or scheduled slopes led to 2.1x improvement in RL performance. Combined with adaptive slope scheduling for drone position control, achieved average return of 400 points, substantially outperforming prior methods like Behavioral Cloning and TD3BC.

Conclusion: The work advances theoretical understanding of surrogate gradient learning in SNNs and provides practical training methodologies for neuromorphic controllers, demonstrating significant improvements in real-world robotic systems.

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing systems are set to revolutionize energy-constrained
robotics by achieving orders-of-magnitude efficiency gains, while enabling
native temporal processing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent a
promising algorithmic approach for these systems, yet their application to
complex control tasks faces two critical challenges: (1) the non-differentiable
nature of spiking neurons necessitates surrogate gradients with unclear
optimization properties, and (2) the stateful dynamics of SNNs require training
on sequences, which in reinforcement learning (RL) is hindered by limited
sequence lengths during early training, preventing the network from bridging
its warm-up period.
  We address these challenges by systematically analyzing surrogate gradient
slope settings, showing that shallower slopes increase gradient magnitude in
deeper layers but reduce alignment with true gradients. In supervised learning,
we find no clear preference for fixed or scheduled slopes. The effect is much
more pronounced in RL settings, where shallower slopes or scheduled slopes lead
to a 2.1x improvement in both training and final deployed performance. Next, we
propose a novel training approach that leverages a privileged guiding policy to
bootstrap the learning process, while still exploiting online environment
interactions with the spiking policy. Combining our method with an adaptive
slope schedule for a real-world drone position control task, we achieve an
average return of 400 points, substantially outperforming prior techniques,
including Behavioral Cloning and TD3BC, which achieve at most --200 points
under the same conditions. This work advances both the theoretical
understanding of surrogate gradient learning in SNNs and practical training
methodologies for neuromorphic controllers demonstrated in real-world robotic
systems.

TL;DR: A cost-efficient pipeline for in-context learning that uses cross-task examples to pseudo-label data via LLMs, then propagates labels through graph-based methods without additional LLM queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting high-quality examples for new or challenging tasks is costly and labor-intensive, creating a need for more efficient labeling methods for in-context learning.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) Use cross-task examples to prompt LLM for pseudo-labeling small target dataset, 2) Graph-based label propagation to spread labels to remaining examples without LLM queries.

Result: Experiments across five tasks show strong performance while significantly reducing labeling costs compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively combines cross-task supervision flexibility with scalable LLM-free propagation, enabling cost-efficient in-context learning for new tasks.

Abstract: The capability of in-context learning (ICL) enables large language models
(LLMs) to perform novel tasks without parameter updates by conditioning on a
few input-output examples. However, collecting high-quality examples for new or
challenging tasks can be costly and labor-intensive. In this work, we propose a
cost-efficient two-stage pipeline that reduces reliance on LLMs for data
labeling. Our approach first leverages readily available cross-task examples to
prompt an LLM and pseudo-label a small set of target task instances. We then
introduce a graph-based label propagation method that spreads label information
to the remaining target examples without additional LLM queries. The resulting
fully pseudo-labeled dataset is used to construct in-task demonstrations for
ICL. This pipeline combines the flexibility of cross-task supervision with the
scalability of LLM-free propagation. Experiments across five tasks demonstrate
that our method achieves strong performance while lowering labeling costs.

Motivation: Generative AI promises transformative opportunities in healthcare but requires deep understanding of healthcare tasks and limitations. Current approaches need better integration of medical data ecosystems to support effective GenAI deployment.

Method: The paper proposes repositioning the data life cycle by making the medical data ecosystem the foundational substrate. This includes semantic vector search, contextual querying, and efficient data processing pipelines to support both upstream model training and downstream clinical applications.

Result: The proposed ecosystem enables sustainable integration of diverse medical data, supports foundation models with high-quality multimodal data for pretraining and fine-tuning, and serves as a knowledge retrieval backend for task-specific inference via agentic layers.

Conclusion: A data-centric paradigm with the medical data ecosystem as the foundation enables effective deployment of GenAI for high-quality healthcare delivery, addressing both model training needs and clinical application requirements.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is taking the world by storm. It
promises transformative opportunities for advancing and disrupting existing
practices, including healthcare. From large language models (LLMs) for clinical
note synthesis and conversational assistance to multimodal systems that
integrate medical imaging, electronic health records, and genomic data for
decision support, GenAI is transforming the practice of medicine and the
delivery of healthcare, such as diagnosis and personalized treatments, with
great potential in reducing the cognitive burden on clinicians, thereby
improving overall healthcare delivery. However, GenAI deployment in healthcare
requires an in-depth understanding of healthcare tasks and what can and cannot
be achieved. In this paper, we propose a data-centric paradigm in the design
and deployment of GenAI systems for healthcare. Specifically, we reposition the
data life cycle by making the medical data ecosystem as the foundational
substrate for generative healthcare systems. This ecosystem is designed to
sustainably support the integration, representation, and retrieval of diverse
medical data and knowledge. With effective and efficient data processing
pipelines, such as semantic vector search and contextual querying, it enables
GenAI-powered operations for upstream model components and downstream clinical
applications. Ultimately, it not only supplies foundation models with
high-quality, multimodal data for large-scale pretraining and domain-specific
fine-tuning, but also serves as a knowledge retrieval backend to support
task-specific inference via the agentic layer. The ecosystem enables the
deployment of GenAI for high-quality and effective healthcare delivery.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FunReason-MT is a novel data synthesis framework that generates high-quality multi-turn function calling training data for LLMs, addressing challenges in real-world environments through environment-API graph interactions, advanced tool-query synthesis, and guided iterative chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data synthesis methods are insufficient for generating high-quality multi-turn function calling data needed for training advanced AI systems to solve complex real-world problems, particularly due to challenges in targeted model training, tool architecture isolation, and multi-turn logical dependencies.

Method: FunReason-MT employs three key techniques: 1) Environment-API Graph Interactions for gathering varied trajectories, 2) Advanced Tool-Query Synthesis to simplify query construction, and 3) Guided Iterative Chain for sophisticated Chain-of-Thought generation.

Result: A 4B model trained on FunReason-MT generated data achieves state-of-the-art performance on Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCLv3), outperforming most comparable-sized models and even closed-source models. Further improvements on BFCLv4 confirm the framework's reliability.

Conclusion: FunReason-MT provides a robust and reliable framework for generating high-quality multi-turn function calling training data, enabling significant performance improvements in agentic learning systems and addressing the structural deficiencies in existing data synthesis approaches.

Abstract: Function calling (FC) empowers large language models (LLMs) and autonomous
agents to interface with external tools, a critical capability for solving
complex, real-world problems. As this ability becomes increasingly central to
advanced AI systems, the need for high-quality, multi-turn training data to
develop and refine it cannot be overstated. Existing data synthesis methods,
such as random environment sampling or multi-agent role-playing, are not
powerful enough to generate high-quality data in real-world environments.
Practical challenges come in three folds: targeted model training, isolation of
tool architecture, and multi-turn logical dependency. To address these
structural deficiencies, we present FunReason-MT, a novel data synthesis
framework for real-world multi-turn tool use. FunReason-MT resolves the
complexity barrier in multi-turn FC data by employing 1) Environment-API Graph
Interactions to gather varied high-quality trajectories, 2) Advanced Tool-Query
Synthesis to simplify hard query construction, and 3) Guided Iterative Chain
for sophisticated CoT generation. Evaluations on Berkeley Function-Calling
Leaderboard (BFCLv3) demonstrate the power of our framework: a 4B model built
upon FunReason-MT generated data achieves state-of-the-art performance among
comparable-sized models, outperforming most close-source models. Further
performance improvements on BFCLv4 confirm that FunReason-MT provides a
reliable and robust source for agentic learning.

Result: Key findings include: FMs gaining significant traction in 2023-24; VLMs outpacing LLMs with 5-10x publication increase; RL and AL still nascent for smart spraying; digital twins enabling virtual simulation of targeted spraying; sim-to-real gap as critical challenge; limited human-robot collaboration; multi-modal FMs with real-time feedback as future direction.

Conclusion: Foundation models represent a paradigm shift in agricultural disease management, with vision-language models leading adoption and multi-modal approaches with real-time feedback poised to drive next-generation site-specific disease management systems, though challenges like sim-to-real transfer and human-robot collaboration need addressing.

Abstract: Site-specific disease management (SSDM) in crops has advanced rapidly through
machine and deep learning (ML and DL) for real-time computer vision. Research
evolved from handcrafted feature extraction to large-scale automated feature
learning. With foundation models (FMs), crop disease datasets are now processed
in fundamentally new ways. Unlike traditional neural networks, FMs integrate
visual and textual data, interpret symptoms in text, reason about
symptom-management relationships, and support interactive QA for growers and
educators. Adaptive and imitation learning in robotics further enables
field-based disease management. This review screened approx. 40 articles on FM
applications for SSDM, focusing on large-language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), and discussing their role in adaptive learning
(AL), reinforcement learning (RL), and digital twin frameworks for targeted
spraying. Key findings: (a) FMs are gaining traction with surging literature in
2023-24; (b) VLMs outpace LLMs, with a 5-10x increase in publications; (c) RL
and AL are still nascent for smart spraying; (d) digital twins with RL can
simulate targeted spraying virtually; (e) addressing the sim-to-real gap is
critical for real-world deployment; (f) human-robot collaboration remains
limited, especially in human-in-the-loop approaches where robots detect early
symptoms and humans validate uncertain cases; (g) multi-modal FMs with
real-time feedback will drive next-gen SSDM. For updates, resources, and

*Shengjie Liu,Li Dong,Zhenyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework that combines tool and document knowledge graphs to improve exemplar artifact generation through deep-sparse integration of structural dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance exemplar artifact generation by uncovering and exploiting dependencies among tools and documents, addressing the need for better integration of tool interactions with procedural knowledge.

Method: Constructs tool knowledge graph from schemas (descriptions, arguments, outputs) using DeepResearch-inspired analysis, creates complementary document knowledge graph from internal docs/SOPs, fuses both graphs, and uses deep-sparse integration to align structural tool dependencies with procedural knowledge for plan generation.

Result: Experiments show the unified framework effectively models tool interactions and improves plan generation performance.

Conclusion: Linking tool graphs with domain knowledge graphs provides significant benefits for tool-augmented reasoning and planning tasks.

Abstract: We present a framework for uncovering and exploiting dependencies among tools
and documents to enhance exemplar artifact generation. Our method begins by
constructing a tool knowledge graph from tool schemas,including descriptions,
arguments, and output payloads, using a DeepResearch-inspired analysis. In
parallel, we derive a complementary knowledge graph from internal documents and
SOPs, which is then fused with the tool graph. To generate exemplar plans, we
adopt a deep-sparse integration strategy that aligns structural tool
dependencies with procedural knowledge. Experiments demonstrate that this
unified framework effectively models tool interactions and improves plan
generation, underscoring the benefits of linking tool graphs with domain
knowledge graphs for tool-augmented reasoning and planning.

### [267] [High-Quality and Large-Scale Image Downscaling for Modern Display Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24334)
*Suvrojit Mitra,G B Kevin Arjun,Sanjay Ghosh*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposed LSID method for large-scale image downscaling using co-occurrence learning to preserve structural and perceptual information while reducing resolution by 8x-16x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern display technology requires high-quality image downscaling that maintains visual authenticity and structural integrity while fitting images to display device dimensions, especially for large-scale resizing scenarios.

Method: Uses co-occurrence learning to create data-driven co-occurrence profiles capturing intensity correlations in nearby neighborhoods, which guides a refined filtering process as content-adaptive range kernel based on pixel similarity with neighbors.

Result: Achieved up to 39.22 dB PSNR on DIV2K dataset and PIQE up to 26.35 when downscaling by 8x and 16x respectively, outperforming contemporary approaches in visual quality and performance metrics on DIV2K, BSD100, Urban100, and RealSR datasets.

Conclusion: LSID method successfully preserves high-frequency structures like edges, textures, and repeating patterns while reducing aliasing and blurring artifacts, achieving high-quality downscaled images without texture loss or edge blurring in large-scale resizing scenarios.

Abstract: In modern display technology and visualization tools, downscaling images is
one of the most important activities. This procedure aims to maintain both
visual authenticity and structural integrity while reducing the dimensions of
an image at a large scale to fit the dimension of the display devices. In this
study, we proposed a new technique for downscaling images that uses
co-occurrence learning to maintain structural and perceptual information while
reducing resolution. The technique uses the input image to create a data-driven
co-occurrence profile that captures the frequency of intensity correlations in
nearby neighborhoods. A refined filtering process is guided by this profile,
which acts as a content-adaptive range kernel. The contribution of each input
pixel is based on how closely it resembles pair-wise intensity values with it's
neighbors. We validate our proposed technique on four datasets: DIV2K, BSD100,
Urban100, and RealSR to show its effective downscaling capacity. Our technique
could obtain up to 39.22 dB PSNR on the DIV2K dataset and PIQE up to 26.35 on
the same dataset when downscaling by 8x and 16x, respectively. Numerous
experimental findings attest to the ability of the suggested picture
downscaling method to outperform more contemporary approaches in terms of both
visual quality and performance measures. Unlike most existing methods, which
did not focus on the large-scale image resizing scenario, we achieve
high-quality downscaled images without texture loss or edge blurring. Our
method, LSID (large scale image downscaling), successfully preserves
high-frequency structures like edges, textures, and repeating patterns by
focusing on statistically consistent pixels while reducing aliasing and
blurring artifacts that are typical of traditional downscaling techniques.

### [268] [Fast algorithms enabling optimization and deep learning for photoacoustic tomography in a circular detection geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24687)
*Andreas Hauptmann,Leonid Kunyansky,Jenni Poimala*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: New fast algorithms for forward and adjoint operators in photoacoustic tomography with circular geometry, achieving O(n² log n) complexity for n×n images, used in iterative reconstruction methods including variational approaches and deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Iterative algorithms in photoacoustic tomography require multiple applications of forward and adjoint operators, which are computationally expensive. Current methods need faster evaluation to improve optimization approaches.

Method: Developed asymptotically fast algorithms for numerical evaluation of forward and adjoint operators in circular acquisition geometry using efficient computational techniques.

Result: Algorithms compute forward and adjoint operators in O(n² log n) floating point operations for (n×n) images, significantly faster than previous methods. Demonstrated effectiveness in various iterative reconstruction techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed fast algorithms enable efficient computation for iterative image reconstruction in photoacoustic tomography, benefiting both classic variational methods and modern deep learning approaches. Python implementation is publicly available.

Abstract: The inverse source problem arising in photoacoustic tomography and in several
other coupled-physics modalities is frequently solved by iterative algorithms.
Such algorithms are based on the minimization of a certain cost functional. In
addition, novel deep learning techniques are currently being investigated to
further improve such optimization approaches. All such methods require multiple
applications of the operator defining the forward problem, and of its adjoint.
In this paper, we present new asymptotically fast algorithms for numerical
evaluation of the forward and adjoint operators, applicable in the circular
acquisition geometry. For an $(n \times n)$ image, our algorithms compute these
operators in $\mathcal{O}(n^2 \log n)$ floating point operations. We
demonstrate the performance of our algorithms in numerical simulations, where
they are used as an integral part of several iterative image reconstruction
techniques: classic variational methods, such as non-negative least squares and
total variation regularized least squares, as well as deep learning methods,
such as learned primal dual. A Python implementation of our algorithms and
computational examples is available to the general public.

### [269] [Dipole-lets: a new multiscale decomposition for MR phase and quantitative susceptibility mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24705)
*Ignacio Contreras-Zúñiga,Mathias Lambert,Benjamín Palacios,Cristian Tejos,Carlos Milovic*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A multiscale transform called Dipole-lets is introduced to identify and suppress streaking artifacts in quantitative susceptibility mapping by detecting dipole incompatibilities in measured field data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Streaking artifacts in quantitative susceptibility mapping are challenging due to extreme noise and non-dipolar phase contributions that get amplified by the dipole kernel, creating characteristic streaking patterns.

Method: Developed Dipole-lets, a multiscale transform that decomposes field data to identify dipole incompatibilities by extracting features of different sizes and orientations relative to the dipole kernel's zero-valued double-cone surface (magic cone). Implemented as optimization functional regularizers using Tikhonov and infinity norm approaches.

Result: Experiments show that non-dipolar content can be extracted from phase data through artifact localization using Dipole-lets.

Conclusion: Dipole-lets provides an effective decomposition method for identifying and suppressing streaking artifacts in quantitative susceptibility mapping by targeting dipole incompatibilities in the measured field data.

Abstract: Identifying and suppressing streaking artifacts is one of the most
challenging problems in quantitative susceptibility mapping. The measured phase
from tissue magnetization is assumed to be the convolution by the magnetic
dipole kernel; direct inversion or standard regularization methods tend to
create streaking artifacts in the estimated susceptibility. This is caused by
extreme noise and by the presence of non-dipolar phase contributions, which are
amplified by the dipole kernel following the streaking pattern. In this work,
we introduce a multiscale transform, called Dipole-lets, as an optimal
decomposition method for identifying dipole incompatibilities in measured field
data by extracting features of different characteristic size and orientation
with respect to the dipole kernel's zero-valued double-cone surface (the magic
cone). We provide experiments that showcase that non-dipolar content can be
extracted by Dipole-lets from phase data through artifact localization. We also
present implementations of Dipole-lets as a optimization functional
regularizator, through simple Tikhonov and infinity norm.
