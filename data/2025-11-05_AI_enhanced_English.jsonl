At the core of our analysis is an extension of the\ndecoupling coefficient, a technique commonly used in the analysis of Feel-good\nThompson sampling (FGTS) that reflects the complexity of the model space. With\nthe new decoupling coefficient denoted by $\\mathrm{dc}$, FGTS-VA achieves the\nregret of\n$\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{\\mathrm{dc}\\cdot\\log|\\mathcal{F}|\\sum_{t=1}^T\\sigma_t^2}+\\mathrm{dc})$,\nwhere $|\\mathcal{F}|$ is the size of the model space, $T$ is the total number\nof rounds, and $\\sigma_t^2$ is the subgaussian norm of the noise (e.g.,\nvariance when the noise is Gaussian) at round $t$.
