### [1] [Self-Supervised Masked Autoencoders with Dense-Unet for Coronary Calcium Removal in limited CT Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02392)
*Mo Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dense-MAE: A self-supervised MAE framework for 3D medical data that improves coronary calcium artifact removal and stenosis estimation in few-shot scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coronary calcification creates blooming artifacts in CTA that hinder stenosis diagnosis. While DCNNs like Dense-Unet can remove artifacts, they require large labeled datasets which are scarce in medical imaging.

Method: Proposed Dense-MAE, a self-supervised learning framework inspired by Masked Autoencoders for 3D point clouds. Uses random masking of 3D patches of vessel lumen and trains Dense-Unet to reconstruct missing geometry, forcing encoder to learn arterial topology features without human annotation.

Result: Experimental results on clinical CTA datasets show that initializing calcium removal networks with MAE-based weights significantly improves inpainting accuracy and stenosis estimation compared to training from scratch, especially in few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: Dense-MAE provides an effective self-supervised pre-training strategy for volumetric medical data that reduces dependency on large labeled datasets and improves performance in calcium artifact removal tasks.

Abstract: Coronary calcification creates blooming artifacts in Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA), severely hampering the diagnosis of lumen stenosis. While Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) like Dense-Unet have shown promise in removing these artifacts via inpainting, they often require large labeled datasets which are scarce in the medical domain. Inspired by recent advancements in Masked Autoencoders (MAE) for 3D point clouds, we propose \textbf{Dense-MAE}, a novel self-supervised learning framework for volumetric medical data. We introduce a pre-training strategy that randomly masks 3D patches of the vessel lumen and trains the Dense-Unet to reconstruct the missing geometry. This forces the encoder to learn high-level latent features of arterial topology without human annotation. Experimental results on clinical CTA datasets demonstrate that initializing the Calcium Removal network with our MAE-based weights significantly improves inpainting accuracy and stenosis estimation compared to training from scratch, specifically in few-shot scenarios.

### [2] [Expert-Guided Explainable Few-Shot Learning with Active Sample Selection for Medical Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02409)
*Longwei Wang,Ifrat Ikhtear Uddin,KC Santosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-framework solution combining explainable few-shot learning and active learning for medical image analysis, addressing data scarcity and interpretability challenges in clinical AI deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image analysis faces two critical challenges: scarcity of labeled data and lack of model interpretability, both hindering clinical AI deployment. Few-shot learning addresses data limitations but lacks transparency, while active learning optimizes data acquisition but overlooks interpretability of acquired samples.

Method: Proposes two frameworks: 1) Expert-Guided Explainable Few-Shot Learning (EGxFSL) integrates radiologist-defined regions-of-interest as spatial supervision via Grad-CAM-based Dice loss, jointly optimized with prototypical classification. 2) Explainability-Guided Active Learning (xGAL) introduces iterative sample acquisition prioritizing both predictive uncertainty and attention misalignment, creating a closed-loop framework where explainability guides training and sample selection synergistically.

Result: Achieved accuracies of 92% on BraTS (MRI), 76% on VinDr-CXR (chest X-ray), and 62% on SIIM-COVID-19 (chest X-ray), consistently outperforming non-guided baselines. Under severe data constraints, xGAL achieved 76% accuracy with only 680 samples versus 57% for random sampling. Grad-CAM visualizations show guided models focus on diagnostically relevant regions, with cross-modality generalization validated on breast ultrasound.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-framework solution successfully addresses both data scarcity and interpretability challenges in medical image analysis, demonstrating superior performance across multiple datasets and modalities while providing clinically meaningful attention maps that enhance trust and deployment potential.

Abstract: Medical image analysis faces two critical challenges: scarcity of labeled data and lack of model interpretability, both hindering clinical AI deployment. Few-shot learning (FSL) addresses data limitations but lacks transparency in predictions. Active learning (AL) methods optimize data acquisition but overlook interpretability of acquired samples. We propose a dual-framework solution: Expert-Guided Explainable Few-Shot Learning (EGxFSL) and Explainability-Guided AL (xGAL). EGxFSL integrates radiologist-defined regions-of-interest as spatial supervision via Grad-CAM-based Dice loss, jointly optimized with prototypical classification for interpretable few-shot learning. xGAL introduces iterative sample acquisition prioritizing both predictive uncertainty and attention misalignment, creating a closed-loop framework where explainability guides training and sample selection synergistically. On the BraTS (MRI), VinDr-CXR (chest X-ray), and SIIM-COVID-19 (chest X-ray) datasets, we achieve accuracies of 92\%, 76\%, and 62\%, respectively, consistently outperforming non-guided baselines across all datasets. Under severe data constraints, xGAL achieves 76\% accuracy with only 680 samples versus 57\% for random sampling. Grad-CAM visualizations demonstrate guided models focus on diagnostically relevant regions, with generalization validated on breast ultrasound confirming cross-modality applicability.

### [3] [MIAR: Modality Interaction and Alignment Representation Fuison for Multimodal Emotion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02414)
*Jichao Zhu,Jun Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIAR proposes a novel multimodal emotion recognition network that addresses modality distribution differences and varying contributions through feature interaction tokens and contrastive learning alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous MER methods inadequately address significant distributional differences among modalities and their varying task contributions, while lacking robust generalization across diverse textual model features, limiting multimodal performance.

Method: Modality Interaction and Alignment Representation (MIAR) integrates contextual features across modalities using feature interaction to generate tokens representing how each modality extracts information from others, then aligns modalities using contrastive learning and normalization strategies.

Result: MIAR outperforms state-of-the-art MER methods on CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed MIAR approach effectively addresses modality distribution differences and varying contributions through interaction tokens and alignment strategies, achieving superior performance in multimodal emotion recognition.

Abstract: Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) aims to perceive human emotions through three modes: language, vision, and audio. Previous methods primarily focused on modal fusion without adequately addressing significant distributional differences among modalities or considering their varying contributions to the task. They also lacked robust generalization capabilities across diverse textual model features, thus limiting performance in multimodal scenarios. Therefore, we propose a novel approach called Modality Interaction and Alignment Representation (MIAR). This network integrates contextual features across different modalities using a feature interaction to generate feature tokens to represent global representations of this modality extracting information from other modalities. These four tokens represent global representations of how each modality extracts information from others. MIAR aligns different modalities using contrastive learning and normalization strategies. We conduct experiments on two benchmarks: CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI datasets, experimental results demonstrate the MIAR outperforms state-of-the-art MER methods.

### [4] [Multimodal Sentiment Analysis based on Multi-channel and Symmetric Mutual Promotion Feature Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02415)
*Wangyuan Zhu,Jun Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a multimodal sentiment analysis method with multi-channel feature extraction and symmetric mutual promotion fusion to address limited single-modality features and inadequate inter-modal fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal sentiment analysis is crucial for human-computer interaction but faces challenges: limited features from single modalities and inadequate fusion that only focuses on consistency while ignoring differences between modalities.

Method: 1) Extract multi-channel features using dual-channel features in visual and auditory modalities for better intra-modal representation. 2) Propose symmetric mutual promotion (SMP) inter-modal fusion combining symmetric cross-modal attention (captures useful info from other modalities) and self-attention (models contextual info). 3) Integrate intra-modal and inter-modal fused features to leverage complementarity while considering differences.

Result: Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.

Conclusion: The proposed approach with multi-channel feature extraction and symmetric mutual promotion fusion effectively addresses limitations in multimodal sentiment analysis by enhancing both intra-modal representation and inter-modal interaction while considering feature complementarity and differences.

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis is a key technology in the fields of human-computer interaction and affective computing. Accurately recognizing human emotional states is crucial for facilitating smooth communication between humans and machines. Despite some progress in multimodal sentiment analysis research, numerous challenges remain. The first challenge is the limited and insufficiently rich features extracted from single modality data. Secondly, most studies focus only on the consistency of inter-modal feature information, neglecting the differences between features, resulting in inadequate feature information fusion. In this paper, we first extract multi-channel features to obtain more comprehensive feature information. We employ dual-channel features in both the visual and auditory modalities to enhance intra-modal feature representation. Secondly, we propose a symmetric mutual promotion (SMP) inter-modal feature fusion method. This method combines symmetric cross-modal attention mechanisms and self-attention mechanisms, where the cross-modal attention mechanism captures useful information from other modalities, and the self-attention mechanism models contextual information. This approach promotes the exchange of useful information between modalities, thereby strengthening inter-modal interactions. Furthermore, we integrate intra-modal features and inter-modal fused features, fully leveraging the complementarity of inter-modal feature information while considering feature information differences. Experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.

*Wenting Lu,Didi Zhu,Tao Shen,Donglin Zhu,Ayong Ye,Chao Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoCoT framework improves multi-modal reasoning by addressing limitations of existing Chain-of-Thought methods through dynamic multi-region grounding and relation-aware reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Chain-of-Thought methods for multi-modal reasoning suffer from over-reliance on single coarse-grained image regions and semantic fragmentation between reasoning steps, limiting their effectiveness in cross-modal scenarios.

Method: Proposes CoCoT (Collaborative Cross-modal Thought) framework with two key innovations: 1) Dynamic Multi-Region Grounding to adaptively detect relevant image regions based on questions, and 2) Relation-Aware Reasoning to enable multi-region collaboration by iteratively aligning visual cues into coherent reasoning chains.

Result: Created CoCoT-70K dataset with 74,691 high-quality samples featuring multi-region annotations and structured reasoning chains. Achieved average accuracy improvements of 15.4% on LLaVA-1.5 and 4.0% on Qwen2-VL across six challenging benchmarks.

Conclusion: CoCoT significantly enhances complex visual reasoning by addressing key limitations of existing methods through collaborative cross-modal thought processes, with publicly available data and code.

Abstract: Multi-modal reasoning requires the seamless integration of visual and linguistic cues, yet existing Chain-of-Thought methods suffer from two critical limitations in cross-modal scenarios: (1) over-reliance on single coarse-grained image regions, and (2) semantic fragmentation between successive reasoning steps. To address these issues, we propose the CoCoT (Collaborative Coross-modal Thought) frame- work, built upon two key innovations: a) Dynamic Multi-Region Grounding to adaptively detect the most relevant image regions based on the question, and b) Relation-Aware Reasoning to enable multi-region collaboration by iteratively align- ing visual cues to form a coherent and logical chain of thought. Through this approach, we construct the CoCoT-70K dataset, comprising 74,691 high-quality samples with multi-region annotations and structured reasoning chains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoCoT significantly enhances complex visual rea- soning, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 15.4% on LLaVA-1.5 and 4.0% on Qwen2-VL across six challenging benchmarks.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of vision tasks, yet their substantial computational and memory demands hinder efficient deployment on resource-constrained mobile and edge devices. Pruning has emerged as a promising direction for reducing ViT complexity. However, existing approaches either (i) produce a single pruned model shared across all devices, ignoring device heterogeneity, or (ii) rely on fine-tuning with device-local data, which is often infeasible due to limited on-device resources and strict privacy constraints. As a result, current methods fall short of enabling task-customized ViT pruning in privacy-preserving mobile computing settings. This paper introduces TAP-ViTs, a novel task-adaptive pruning framework that generates device-specific pruned ViT models without requiring access to any raw local data. Specifically, to infer device-level task characteristics under privacy constraints, we propose a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based metric dataset construction mechanism. Each device fits a lightweight GMM to approximate its private data distribution and uploads only the GMM parameters. Using these parameters, the cloud selects distribution-consistent samples from public data to construct a task-representative metric dataset for each device. Based on this proxy dataset, we further develop a dual-granularity importance evaluation-based pruning strategy that jointly measures composite neuron importance and adaptive layer importance, enabling fine-grained, task-aware pruning tailored to each device's computational budget. Extensive experiments across multiple ViT backbones and datasets demonstrate that TAP-ViTs consistently outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods under comparable compression ratios.

### [8] [Evaluating the Diagnostic Classification Ability of Multimodal Large Language Models: Insights from the Osteoarthritis Initiative](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02443)
*Li Wang,Xi Chen,XiangWen Deng,HuaHui Yi,ZeKun Jiang,Kang Li,Jian Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs underperform in knee OA classification compared to vision-only models, with LLMs better suited for interpretation than classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate MLLM architectures on knee osteoarthritis radiograph classification, which is underrepresented in medical MLLM benchmarks despite affecting 300-400 million people worldwide.

Method: Systematic ablation studies manipulating vision encoder, connector, and LLM components across diverse training strategies, comparing performance on balanced (500 images) vs. imbalanced (5,778 images) datasets.

Result: Vision encoder alone outperformed full MLLM pipelines; LLM fine-tuning provided no improvement over prompt-based guidance; LoRA fine-tuning on small balanced dataset gave better results than larger imbalanced dataset.

Conclusion: For domain-specific medical classification, LLMs are more effective as interpreters/report generators than primary classifiers; MLLM architecture is less suitable for high-certainty diagnostic tasks; prioritize vision encoder optimization and careful dataset curation.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promising performance on medical visual question answering (VQA) and report generation, but these generation and explanation abilities do not reliably transfer to disease-specific classification. We evaluated MLLM architectures on knee osteoarthritis (OA) radiograph classification, which remains underrepresented in existing medical MLLM benchmarks, even though knee OA affects an estimated 300 to 400 million people worldwide. Through systematic ablation studies manipulating the vision encoder, the connector, and the large language model (LLM) across diverse training strategies, we measured each component's contribution to diagnostic accuracy. In our classification task, a trained vision encoder alone could outperform full MLLM pipelines in classification accuracy and fine-tuning the LLM provided no meaningful improvement over prompt-based guidance. And LoRA fine-tuning on a small, class-balanced dataset (500 images) gave better results than training on a much larger but class-imbalanced set (5,778 images), indicating that data balance and quality can matter more than raw scale for this task. These findings suggest that for domain-specific medical classification, LLMs are more effective as interpreters and report generators rather than as primary classifiers. Therefore, the MLLM architecture appears less suitable for medical image diagnostic classification tasks that demand high certainty. We recommend prioritizing vision encoder optimization and careful dataset curation when developing clinically applicable systems.

### [9] [Understanding Pure Textual Reasoning for Blind Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02441)
*Yuan Li,Shin'ya Nishida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Textual reasoning in BIQA has unclear contributions; three paradigms (Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, Autoencoder) were compared to understand image-text-score relationships, revealing Self-Consistency most effectively bridges image-text prediction gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how textual information contributes to quality prediction in Blind Image Quality Assessment (BIQA) and determine to what extent text can represent score-related image contents, as current textual reasoning approaches have unclear mechanisms.

Method: Analyzed from an information-flow perspective by comparing existing BIQA models with three paradigms: Chain-of-Thought (step-by-step reasoning), Self-Consistency (ensuring consistent predictions), and Autoencoder (reconstructing image information from text).

Result: Existing models' performance drops significantly when using only text for prediction. Chain-of-Thought provides little improvement, Self-Consistency dramatically reduces image-text prediction gap (PLCC/SRCC difference to 0.02/0.03), while Autoencoder is less effective but reveals optimization directions.

Conclusion: Self-Consistency paradigm most effectively bridges the gap between image- and text-conditioned predictions in BIQA, providing insights for improving textual reasoning in BIQA and high-level vision tasks.

Abstract: Textual reasoning has recently been widely adopted in Blind Image Quality Assessment (BIQA). However, it remains unclear how textual information contributes to quality prediction and to what extent text can represent the score-related image contents. This work addresses these questions from an information-flow perspective by comparing existing BIQA models with three paradigms designed to learn the image-text-score relationship: Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, and Autoencoder. Our experiments show that the score prediction performance of the existing model significantly drops when only textual information is used for prediction. Whereas the Chain-of-Thought paradigm introduces little improvement in BIQA performance, the Self-Consistency paradigm significantly reduces the gap between image- and text-conditioned predictions, narrowing the PLCC/SRCC difference to 0.02/0.03. The Autoencoder-like paradigm is less effective in closing the image-text gap, yet it reveals a direction for further optimization. These findings provide insights into how to improve the textual reasoning for BIQA and high-level vision tasks.

### [10] [A Spatio-Temporal Deep Learning Approach For High-Resolution Gridded Monsoon Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02445)
*Parashjyoti Borah,Sanghamitra Sarkar,Ranjan Phukan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning framework treats monsoon prediction as spatio-temporal computer vision task, using CNN to map pre-monsoon atmospheric/oceanic fields to high-resolution gridded rainfall patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional monsoon forecasting provides only spatially-averaged seasonal values, lacking spatial detail needed for regional resource management. There's a need for high-resolution gridded predictions to better support agriculture, economy, and water security for over a billion people in India.

Method: Treats multi-variable pre-monsoon atmospheric and oceanic fields as sequence of multi-channel images (video-like input tensor). Uses CNN-based architecture to learn mapping from five-month pre-monsoon period (Jan-May) to high-resolution gridded rainfall patterns. Trained on 85 years of ERA5 reanalysis data for predictors and IMD rainfall data for targets.

Result: Successfully produces distinct forecasts for each of the four monsoon months (June-September) as well as total seasonal average. Demonstrates utility for both intra-seasonal and seasonal outlooks with high spatial resolution.

Conclusion: The deep learning framework effectively addresses the spatial detail gap in traditional monsoon forecasting, providing valuable high-resolution gridded predictions that can support regional-level resource management and decision-making for the critical Indian Summer Monsoon system.

Abstract: The Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) is a critical climate phenomenon, fundamentally impacting the agriculture, economy, and water security of over a billion people. Traditional long-range forecasting, whether statistical or dynamical, has predominantly focused on predicting a single, spatially-averaged seasonal value, lacking the spatial detail essential for regional-level resource management. To address this gap, we introduce a novel deep learning framework that reframes gridded monsoon prediction as a spatio-temporal computer vision task. We treat multi-variable, pre-monsoon atmospheric and oceanic fields as a sequence of multi-channel images, effectively creating a video-like input tensor. Using 85 years of ERA5 reanalysis data for predictors and IMD rainfall data for targets, we employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based architecture to learn the complex mapping from the five-month pre-monsoon period (January-May) to a high-resolution gridded rainfall pattern for the subsequent monsoon season. Our framework successfully produces distinct forecasts for each of the four monsoon months (June-September) as well as the total seasonal average, demonstrating its utility for both intra-seasonal and seasonal outlooks.

### [11] [Don't Mind the Gaps: Implicit Neural Representations for Resolution-Agnostic Retinal OCT Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02447)
*Bennet Kahrs,Julia Andresen,Fenja Falta,Monty Santarossa,Heinz Handels,Timo Kepp*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: INR-based frameworks for dense 3D analysis of anisotropic retinal OCT volumes using resolution-agnostic implicit neural representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical OCT imaging has large slice spacing (anisotropic), forcing most methods to use 2D approaches that risk inconsistent results for neighboring B-scans and cannot handle different imaging protocols. INRs offer resolution-agnostic continuous representations.

Method: Two INR-based frameworks: 1) Inter-B-scan interpolation incorporating en-face modality information to retain structures between B-scans, 2) Resolution-agnostic retinal atlas using population-based training for general analysis without strict data requirements.

Result: Generalizable INRs improve retinal shape representation through population-based training, enabling predictions for unseen cases and resolution-independent analysis of OCT images with large B-scan distances.

Conclusion: The resolution-independent frameworks facilitate volumetric evaluation of retinal structures and pathologies in anisotropic OCT data, overcoming limitations of traditional 2D approaches.

Abstract: Routine clinical imaging of the retina using optical coherence tomography (OCT) is performed with large slice spacing, resulting in highly anisotropic images and a sparsely scanned retina. Most learning-based methods circumvent the problems arising from the anisotropy by using 2D approaches rather than performing volumetric analyses. These approaches inherently bear the risk of generating inconsistent results for neighboring B-scans. For example, 2D retinal layer segmentations can have irregular surfaces in 3D. Furthermore, the typically used convolutional neural networks are bound to the resolution of the training data, which prevents their usage for images acquired with a different imaging protocol. Implicit neural representations (INRs) have recently emerged as a tool to store voxelized data as a continuous representation. Using coordinates as input, INRs are resolution-agnostic, which allows them to be applied to anisotropic data. In this paper, we propose two frameworks that make use of this characteristic of INRs for dense 3D analyses of retinal OCT volumes. 1) We perform inter-B-scan interpolation by incorporating additional information from en-face modalities, that help retain relevant structures between B-scans. 2) We create a resolution-agnostic retinal atlas that enables general analysis without strict requirements for the data. Both methods leverage generalizable INRs, improving retinal shape representation through population-based training and allowing predictions for unseen cases. Our resolution-independent frameworks facilitate the analysis of OCT images with large B-scan distances, opening up possibilities for the volumetric evaluation of retinal structures and pathologies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 3D encoder model that produces language-aligned patch-level features directly from point clouds, enabling zero-shot 3D part segmentation without expensive multi-view rendering or LLM prompt engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D foundation models transfer poorly to local part-level reasoning, while existing approaches require expensive multi-view rendering, depend on LLM prompt engineering, and fail to exploit inherent 3D geometry.

Method: Two-stage pre-training: (1) distill dense 2D features from visual encoders (DINOv2) into 3D patches, and (2) align patch embeddings with part-level text embeddings using multi-positive contrastive objective.

Result: Achieves zero-shot 3D part segmentation with fast single-pass inference, significantly outperforming previous rendering-based and feed-forward approaches across several benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed encoder-only 3D model effectively addresses the gap in local part-level reasoning by directly processing point clouds and aligning with language, eliminating the need for expensive multi-view rendering.

Abstract: Current foundation models for 3D shapes excel at global tasks (retrieval, classification) but transfer poorly to local part-level reasoning. Recent approaches leverage vision and language foundation models to directly solve dense tasks through multi-view renderings and text queries. While promising, these pipelines require expensive inference over multiple renderings, depend heavily on large language-model (LLM) prompt engineering for captions, and fail to exploit the inherent 3D geometry of shapes. We address this gap by introducing an encoder-only 3D model that produces language-aligned patch-level features directly from point clouds. Our pre-training approach builds on existing data engines that generate part-annotated 3D shapes by pairing multi-view SAM regions with VLM captioning. Using this data, we train a point cloud transformer encoder in two stages: (1) distillation of dense 2D features from visual encoders such as DINOv2 into 3D patches, and (2) alignment of these patch embeddings with part-level text embeddings through a multi-positive contrastive objective. Our 3D encoder achieves zero-shot 3D part segmentation with fast single-pass inference without any test-time multi-view rendering, while significantly outperforming previous rendering-based and feed-forward approaches across several 3D part segmentation benchmarks.

*Amirreza Parvahan,Mohammad Hoseyni,Javad Khoramdel,Amirhossein Nikoofard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lightweight 3D medical imaging framework that treats CT scans as video streams for efficient intracranial hemorrhage detection on edge devices, using YOLO for slice-level detection and ByteTrack for temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Volumetric medical imaging analysis on edge devices is limited by high memory/computational demands of 3D CNNs. Need efficient solutions for time-sensitive tasks like intracranial hemorrhage detection in resource-constrained environments (mobile stroke units, remote clinics).

Method: Reformulate volumetric CT data as sequential video streams. Benchmark YOLO architectures (v8, v10, v11, v12 Nano) for slice-level detection, select best performing version. Use ByteTrack algorithm for anatomical consistency across z-axis. Propose hybrid inference strategy and spatiotemporal consistency filter to address tracker initialization lag and reduce prediction noise.

Result: Framework increases detection precision from 0.703 to 0.779 compared to baseline 2D detector while maintaining high sensitivity. Provides scalable solution for real-time patient prioritization at fraction of computational cost of 3D CNNs.

Conclusion: Video-viewpoint paradigm effectively approximates 3D contextual reasoning for medical imaging, enabling efficient edge deployment for time-sensitive applications like intracranial hemorrhage detection in resource-constrained healthcare settings.

Abstract: Automated analysis of volumetric medical imaging on edge devices is severely constrained by the high memory and computational demands of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This paper develops a lightweight computer vision framework that reconciles the efficiency of 2D detection with the necessity of 3D context by reformulating volumetric Computer Tomography (CT) data as sequential video streams. This video-viewpoint paradigm is applied to the time-sensitive task of Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH) detection using the Hemorica dataset. To ensure operational efficiency, we benchmarked multiple generations of the YOLO architecture (v8, v10, v11 and v12) in their Nano configurations, selecting the version with the highest mAP@50 to serve as the slice-level backbone. A ByteTrack algorithm is then introduced to enforce anatomical consistency across the $z$-axis. To address the initialization lag inherent in video trackers, a hybrid inference strategy and a spatiotemporal consistency filter are proposed to distinguish true pathology from transient prediction noise. Experimental results on independent test data demonstrate that the proposed framework serves as a rigorous temporal validator, increasing detection Precision from 0.703 to 0.779 compared to the baseline 2D detector, while maintaining high sensitivity. By approximating 3D contextual reasoning at a fraction of the computational cost, this method provides a scalable solution for real-time patient prioritization in resource-constrained environments, such as mobile stroke units and IoT-enabled remote clinics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VideoQA benchmarks struggle to capture complex multimodal reasoning needed for understanding real-world videos like movies, and are largely not open-ended due to difficulties in evaluating free-form answers.

Method: Created benchmark using movie recap videos from YouTube that summarize films through synchronized visual and textual modalities. Generated QA pairs from recap summaries aligned with movie subtitles, providing explicit textual context for reference-free evaluation. Includes videos of multiple lengths and categorizes questions by modality and type.

Result: Evaluation of seven state-of-the-art MLLMs revealed: 1) visual-only questions remain most challenging, 2) models default to textual inputs when available, 3) extracting factually accurate information from video content is difficult for all models, and 4) proprietary and open-source models perform comparably on video-dependent questions.

Conclusion: MovieRecapsQA is the first open-ended VideoQA benchmark that supplies explicit textual context for evaluation, enabling fine-grained analysis of multimodal reasoning capabilities and revealing significant challenges in visual understanding and factual extraction from video content.

Abstract: Understanding real-world videos such as movies requires integrating visual and dialogue cues to answer complex questions. Yet existing VideoQA benchmarks struggle to capture this multimodal reasoning and are largely not open-ended, given the difficulty of evaluating free-form answers. In this paper, we introduce a novel open-ended multi-modal VideoQA benchmark, MovieRecapsQA created using movie recap videos--a distinctive type of YouTube content that summarizes a film by presenting its key events through synchronized visual (recap video) and textual (recap summary) modalities. Using the recap summary, we generate $\approx 8.2$ K question-answer (QA) pairs (aligned with movie-subtitles) and provide the necessary "facts" needed to verify an answer in a reference-free manner. To our knowledge, this is the first open-ended VideoQA benchmark that supplies explicit textual context of the input (video and/or text); which we use for evaluation. Our benchmark provides videos of multiple lengths (i.e., recap-segments, movie-segments) and categorizations of questions (by modality and type) to enable fine-grained analysis. We evaluate the performance of seven state-of-the-art MLLMs using our benchmark and observe that: 1) visual-only questions remain the most challenging; 2) models default to textual inputs whenever available; 3) extracting factually accurate information from video content is still difficult for all models; and 4) proprietary and open-source models perform comparably on video-dependent questions.

*Junbin Zhang,Hamid Reza Tohidypour,Yixiao Wang,Panos Nasiopoulos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified deep learning approach for localizing both shallowfake and deepfake image manipulations using Vision Mamba networks and a novel Guided Graph Neural Network module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image manipulation localization is critical due to the societal impact of forged images, but existing approaches typically focus on either shallowfakes (traditional editing) or deepfakes (AI-generated), not both. There's a need for a unified solution that can handle both types of manipulations.

Method: The method uses Vision Mamba networks to extract feature maps that clearly delineate boundaries between tampered and authentic regions. It further enhances this separation with a novel Guided Graph Neural Network (G-GNN) module that amplifies the distinction between manipulated and authentic pixels.

Result: The proposed method achieved higher inference accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art methods in localizing both shallowfake and deepfake image manipulations.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the feasibility of using a unified deep learning approach for localizing both shallowfake and deepfake image manipulations, with the proposed Vision Mamba + G-GNN architecture outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Image manipulation localization is a critical research task, given that forged images may have a significant societal impact of various aspects. Such image manipulations can be produced using traditional image editing tools (known as "shallowfakes") or advanced artificial intelligence techniques ("deepfakes"). While numerous studies have focused on image manipulation localization on either shallowfake images or deepfake videos, few approaches address both cases. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using a deep learning network to localize manipulations in both shallow- and deep-fake images, and proposed a solution for such purpose. To precisely differentiate between authentic and manipulated pixels, we leverage the Vision Mamba network to extract feature maps that clearly describe the boundaries between tampered and untouched regions. To further enhance this separation, we propose a novel Guided Graph Neural Network (G-GNN) module that amplifies the distinction between manipulated and authentic pixels. Our evaluation results show that our proposed method achieved higher inference accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

*Aniruddha Mahapatra,Long Mai,Cusuh Ham,Feng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DreamLoop is a controllable video synthesis framework that generates cinemagraphs (static photos with selective looping motion) from single photos without requiring cinemagraph training data, using adapted video diffusion models with temporal bridging and motion conditioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for generating cinemagraphs are limited to simple motions and narrow domains (like water/smoke), while general video diffusion models aren't designed for cinemagraph constraints and lack specialized data for seamless loops.

Method: Adapts a general video diffusion model by training on two objectives: temporal bridging and motion conditioning. During inference, uses input image as both first- and last-frame to enforce seamless loops, conditions on static tracks to maintain background, and uses user-specified motion paths for intuitive control.

Result: Produces high-quality, complex cinemagraphs that align with user intent, outperforming existing approaches. First method to enable cinemagraph generation for general scenes with flexible and intuitive controls.

Conclusion: DreamLoop successfully generates controllable cinemagraphs from single photos without specialized training data, addressing limitations of existing methods by adapting video diffusion models with novel training objectives and inference techniques.

Abstract: Cinemagraphs, which combine static photographs with selective, looping motion, offer unique artistic appeal. Generating them from a single photograph in a controllable manner is particularly challenging. Existing image-animation techniques are restricted to simple, low-frequency motions and operate only in narrow domains with repetitive textures like water and smoke. In contrast, large-scale video diffusion models are not tailored for cinemagraph constraints and lack the specialized data required to generate seamless, controlled loops. We present DreamLoop, a controllable video synthesis framework dedicated to generating cinemagraphs from a single photo without requiring any cinemagraph training data. Our key idea is to adapt a general video diffusion model by training it on two objectives: temporal bridging and motion conditioning. This strategy enables flexible cinemagraph generation. During inference, by using the input image as both the first- and last- frame condition, we enforce a seamless loop. By conditioning on static tracks, we maintain a static background. Finally, by providing a user-specified motion path for a target object, our method provides intuitive control over the animation's trajectory and timing. To our knowledge, DreamLoop is the first method to enable cinemagraph generation for general scenes with flexible and intuitive controls. We demonstrate that our method produces high-quality, complex cinemagraphs that align with user intent, outperforming existing approaches.

*Shuman He,Xiehua Li,Xioaju Yang,Yang Xiong,Keqin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRRE is a novel AI-generated image detection method that removes and reconstructs the green channel, exploiting differences in reconstruction errors between real and synthetic images for robust cross-model generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-generated image detection methods struggle with generalization to unseen generative models, as rapid advances in diffusion models and GANs make synthetic images increasingly indistinguishable from real ones.

Method: Proposes G-channel Removed Reconstruction Error (GRRE) - a detection paradigm based on removing the green channel from images and analyzing reconstruction errors. Real images show significantly different reconstruction error patterns compared to AI-generated images when their green channel is removed and reconstructed.

Result: GRRE achieves high detection accuracy across multiple generative models, including unseen ones. It maintains robustness against perturbations and post-processing operations while demonstrating superior cross-model generalization compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: Channel-removal-based reconstruction, particularly GRRE, shows strong potential as a forensic tool for detecting AI-generated images, offering robust generalization capabilities that address the challenge of rapidly evolving generative models.

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models, particularly diffusion models and GANs, has greatly increased the difficulty of distinguishing synthetic images from real ones. Although numerous detection methods have been proposed, their accuracy often degrades when applied to images generated by novel or unseen generative models, highlighting the challenge of achieving strong generalization. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel detection paradigm based on channel removal reconstruction. Specifically, we observe that when the green (G) channel is removed from real images and reconstructed, the resulting reconstruction errors differ significantly from those of AI-generated images. Building upon this insight, we propose G-channel Removed Reconstruction Error (GRRE), a simple yet effective method that exploits this discrepancy for robust AI-generated image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRRE consistently achieves high detection accuracy across multiple generative models, including those unseen during training. Compared with existing approaches, GRRE not only maintains strong robustness against various perturbations and post-processing operations but also exhibits superior cross-model generalization. These results highlight the potential of channel-removal-based reconstruction as a powerful forensic tool for safeguarding image authenticity in the era of generative AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion transfer from 2D videos to 3D assets is challenging due to pose ambiguities and diverse object shapes, typically requiring category-specific parametric templates which limit generalization.

Method: Uses morphology-parameterized articulated 3D Gaussian splatting model with dense semantic correspondences to jointly optimize shape and pose, alleviating shape-pose ambiguities.

Result: Superior motion accuracy, efficiency, and visual coherence compared to existing methods, enabling faithful motion transfer across diverse categories and casual video scenarios.

Conclusion: CAMO advances motion transfer by eliminating need for predefined templates or explicit 3D supervision, enabling category-agnostic motion transfer from monocular 2D videos.

Abstract: Motion transfer from 2D videos to 3D assets is a challenging problem, due to inherent pose ambiguities and diverse object shapes, often requiring category-specific parametric templates. We propose CAMO, a category-agnostic framework that transfers motion to diverse target meshes directly from monocular 2D videos without relying on predefined templates or explicit 3D supervision. The core of CAMO is a morphology-parameterized articulated 3D Gaussian splatting model combined with dense semantic correspondences to jointly adapt shape and pose through optimization. This approach effectively alleviates shape-pose ambiguities, enabling visually faithful motion transfer for diverse categories. Experimental results demonstrate superior motion accuracy, efficiency, and visual coherence compared to existing methods, significantly advancing motion transfer in varied object categories and casual video scenarios.

TL;DR: Proposes a robust framework for 3D mesh saliency ground truth acquisition using view cone sampling and hybrid manifold-Euclidean constrained diffusion to address limitations of current VR eye-tracking methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D mesh saliency ground truth acquisition methods ignore differences between 3D geometry topology and 2D image arrays. VR eye-tracking pipelines rely on single ray sampling and Euclidean smoothing, causing texture attention bias and signal leakage across gaps.

Method: 1) View cone sampling (VCS) strategy using Gaussian-distributed ray bundles to simulate human foveal receptive field for robust sampling of complex topologies. 2) Hybrid Manifold-Euclidean constrained diffusion (HCD) algorithm that fuses manifold geodesic constraints with Euclidean scales for topologically-consistent saliency propagation.

Result: The framework mitigates "topological short-circuits" and aliasing, providing high-fidelity 3D attention acquisition that aligns with natural human perception, offering more accurate and robust baseline for 3D mesh saliency research.

Conclusion: Proposed framework addresses limitations of current methods by better simulating human visual perception in 3D environments, providing more reliable ground truth for human-centric visual modeling in virtual reality applications.

Abstract: Reliable 3D mesh saliency ground truth (GT) is essential for human-centric visual modeling in virtual reality (VR). However, current 3D mesh saliency GT acquisition methods are generally consistent with 2D image methods, ignoring the differences between 3D geometry topology and 2D image array. Current VR eye-tracking pipelines rely on single ray sampling and Euclidean smoothing, triggering texture attention and signal leakage across gaps. This paper proposes a robust framework to address these limitations. We first introduce a view cone sampling (VCS) strategy, which simulates the human foveal receptive field via Gaussian-distributed ray bundles to improve sampling robustness for complex topologies. Furthermore, a hybrid Manifold-Euclidean constrained diffusion (HCD) algorithm is developed, fusing manifold geodesic constraints with Euclidean scales to ensure topologically-consistent saliency propagation. By mitigating "topological short-circuits" and aliasing, our framework provides a high-fidelity 3D attention acquisition paradigm that aligns with natural human perception, offering a more accurate and robust baseline for 3D mesh saliency research.

*Longzhen Li,Guang Li,Ren Togo,Keisuke Maeda,Takahiro Ogawa,Miki Haseyama*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a foreground-aware dataset distillation method using Grounded SAM2 for object detection and dynamic patch selection to preserve key object information while reducing background redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional dataset distillation methods have issues: optimization-based approaches are computationally expensive and generate unrealistic images, while non-optimization methods using rigid patch selection discard critical object information. Need to preserve more key information about main objects while reducing background content.

Method: Uses Grounded SAM2 to identify foreground objects and compute per-image foreground occupancy. Derives category-wise patch decision thresholds. Implements dynamic patch selection: either selects most informative patch from multiple candidates or resizes full image when foreground dominates. Dual-path mechanism preserves key object information while reducing background redundancy.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show consistent improvement over existing approaches. Produces more informative and representative distilled datasets with enhanced robustness across different architectures and image compositions.

Conclusion: The proposed foreground-aware dataset distillation method effectively addresses limitations of previous approaches by preserving critical object information through content-adaptive patch selection, resulting in better performance and generalization.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a foreground-aware dataset distillation method that enhances patch selection in a content-adaptive manner. With the rising computational cost of training large-scale deep models, dataset distillation has emerged as a promising approach for constructing compact synthetic datasets that retain the knowledge of their large original counterparts. However, traditional optimization-based methods often suffer from high computational overhead, memory constraints, and the generation of unrealistic, noise-like images with limited architectural generalization. Recent non-optimization methods alleviate some of these issues by constructing distilled data from real image patches, but the used rigid patch selection strategies can still discard critical information about the main objects. To solve this problem, we first leverage Grounded SAM2 to identify foreground objects and compute per-image foreground occupancy, from which we derive a category-wise patch decision threshold. Guided by these thresholds, we design a dynamic patch selection strategy that, for each image, either selects the most informative patch from multiple candidates or directly resizes the full image when the foreground dominates. This dual-path mechanism preserves more key information about the main objects while reducing redundant background content. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed method consistently improves distillation performance over existing approaches, producing more informative and representative distilled datasets and enhancing robustness across different architectures and image compositions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel homography-guided pose estimator network for visual localization between multi-view images and SD maps that uses homography constraints to improve training efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing regression-based visual localization methods on SD maps overlook geometric priors, leading to suboptimal training efficiency and limited localization accuracy. There's a need to better leverage inherent geometric relationships for more efficient and accurate image-to-map localization.

Method: Proposes a homography-guided pose estimator network that: 1) constructs input pairs satisfying homography constraints by projecting ground-view features into BEV domain, 2) enforces semantic alignment with map features, 3) uses homography relationships to guide feature fusion, and 4) restricts pose outputs to valid feasible regions. Unifies BEV semantic reasoning with homography learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on nuScenes dataset show the approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art visual localization methods. The framework also naturally supports cross-resolution inputs due to explicit homography modeling.

Conclusion: The proposed homography-guided framework provides a more efficient and accurate solution for visual localization on SD maps by leveraging geometric priors, outperforming attention-based fusion and direct pose regression methods while offering better flexibility.

Abstract: Visual localization on standard-definition (SD) maps has emerged as a promising low-cost and scalable solution for autonomous driving. However, existing regression-based approaches often overlook inherent geometric priors, resulting in suboptimal training efficiency and limited localization accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel homography-guided pose estimator network for fine-grained visual localization between multi-view images and standard-definition (SD) maps. We construct input pairs that satisfy a homography constraint by projecting ground-view features into the BEV domain and enforcing semantic alignment with map features. Then we leverage homography relationships to guide feature fusion and restrict the pose outputs to a valid feasible region, which significantly improves training efficiency and localization accuracy compared to prior methods relying on attention-based fusion and direct 3-DoF pose regression. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to unify BEV semantic reasoning with homography learning for image-to-map localization. Furthermore, by explicitly modeling homography transformations, the proposed framework naturally supports cross-resolution inputs, enhancing model flexibility. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art visual localization methods. Code and pretrained models will be publicly released to foster future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs struggle with functional imaging like PET scans due to a "functional perception gap" where they can't decode tracer biodistribution without morphological priors. The paper introduces PET-Bench benchmark, identifies "CoT hallucination trap," and proposes AVA fine-tuning to fix it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs excel at anatomical imaging tasks but have unexplored limitations in functional imaging like PET scans. There's a fundamental gap in their ability to perceive functional tracer biodistribution independent of anatomical structure.

Method: 1) Created PET-Bench: large-scale functional imaging benchmark with 52,308 QA pairs from 9,732 multi-site PET studies. 2) Evaluated 19 SOTA MLLMs, identifying "CoT hallucination trap." 3) Proposed Atomic Visual Alignment (AVA): fine-tuning strategy that enforces mastery of low-level functional perception before high-level reasoning.

Result: Standard CoT prompting paradoxically decouples linguistic generation from visual evidence in PET, producing fluent but ungrounded diagnoses. AVA effectively bridges the perception gap, transforms CoT from hallucination source to robust inference tool, and improves diagnostic accuracy by up to 14.83%.

Conclusion: Functional imaging requires different perception capabilities than anatomical imaging. AVA fine-tuning addresses the fundamental perception gap in MLLMs for PET analysis, making CoT reasoning reliable and significantly improving diagnostic accuracy in functional imaging tasks.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in tasks such as abnormality detection and report generation for anatomical modalities, their capability in functional imaging remains largely unexplored. In this work, we identify and quantify a fundamental functional perception gap: the inability of current vision encoders to decode functional tracer biodistribution independent of morphological priors. Identifying Positron Emission Tomography (PET) as the quintessential modality to investigate this disconnect, we introduce PET-Bench, the first large-scale functional imaging benchmark comprising 52,308 hierarchical QA pairs from 9,732 multi-site, multi-tracer PET studies. Extensive evaluation of 19 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals a critical safety hazard termed the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) hallucination trap. We observe that standard CoT prompting, widely considered to enhance reasoning, paradoxically decouples linguistic generation from visual evidence in PET, producing clinically fluent but factually ungrounded diagnoses. To resolve this, we propose Atomic Visual Alignment (AVA), a simple fine-tuning strategy that enforces the mastery of low-level functional perception prior to high-level diagnostic reasoning. Our results demonstrate that AVA effectively bridges the perception gap, transforming CoT from a source of hallucination into a robust inference tool and improving diagnostic accuracy by up to 14.83%.

Conclusion: The proposed D³R-DETR with Dual-Domain Density Refinement effectively addresses challenges in tiny object detection by leveraging spatial-frequency fusion for improved feature refinement and density prediction.

Abstract: Detecting tiny objects plays a vital role in remote sensing intelligent interpretation, as these objects often carry critical information for downstream applications.

TL;DR: BUFFER-X is a training-free point cloud registration framework that achieves zero-shot generalization across diverse environments without dataset-specific tuning or retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning-based point cloud registration methods struggle with zero-shot generalization, requiring dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning or retraining for new environments. Three key limitations are identified: fixed user-defined parameters that don't generalize across scales, poor cross-domain transferability of learned keypoint detectors, and scale mismatches from absolute coordinates.

Method: BUFFER-X addresses three core issues: (1) geometric bootstrapping for automatic hyperparameter estimation, (2) distribution-aware farthest point sampling to replace learned detectors, and (3) patch-level coordinate normalization for scale consistency. It uses hierarchical multi-scale matching across local, middle, and global receptive fields. BUFFER-X-Lite adds early exit strategies and fast pose solvers for efficiency.

Result: Evaluated on 12 datasets spanning object-scale, indoor, and outdoor scenes, including cross-sensor registration between heterogeneous LiDAR configurations. The approach generalizes effectively without manual tuning or prior knowledge of test domains. BUFFER-X-Lite reduces total computation time by 43% relative to BUFFER-X while preserving accuracy.

Conclusion: BUFFER-X provides a robust, training-free solution for point cloud registration that achieves zero-shot generalization across diverse environments, addressing key limitations of existing deep learning methods through geometric bootstrapping, distribution-aware sampling, and coordinate normalization.

Abstract: Some deep learning-based point cloud registration methods struggle with zero-shot generalization, often requiring dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning or retraining for new environments. We identify three critical limitations: (a) fixed user-defined parameters (e.g., voxel size, search radius) that fail to generalize across varying scales, (b) learned keypoint detectors exhibit poor cross-domain transferability, and (c) absolute coordinates amplify scale mismatches between datasets. To address these three issues, we present BUFFER-X, a training-free registration framework that achieves zero-shot generalization through: (a) geometric bootstrapping for automatic hyperparameter estimation, (b) distribution-aware farthest point sampling to replace learned detectors, and (c) patch-level coordinate normalization to ensure scale consistency. Our approach employs hierarchical multi-scale matching to extract correspondences across local, middle, and global receptive fields, enabling robust registration in diverse environments. For efficiency-critical applications, we introduce BUFFER-X-Lite, which reduces total computation time by 43% (relative to BUFFER-X) through early exit strategies and fast pose solvers while preserving accuracy. We evaluate on a comprehensive benchmark comprising 12 datasets spanning object-scale, indoor, and outdoor scenes, including cross-sensor registration between heterogeneous LiDAR configurations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current monocular depth estimation methods rely on large-scale datasets and complex decoders, limiting efficiency and generalization. Need for lightweight, data-centric approach for zero-shot depth estimation.

Method: 1) Use DINOv3 as visual encoder for high-quality dense features. 2) Design Simple Depth Transformer (SDT) decoder with single-path feature fusion and upsampling to reduce computational overhead. 3) Implement quality-based filtering strategy to remove harmful training samples.

Result: SDT reduces parameters by 85-89% compared to DPT while achieving higher accuracy. Quality filtering reduces dataset size while improving training quality. Framework outperforms DPT on five benchmarks.

Conclusion: Balancing model design and data quality is crucial for efficient and generalizable zero-shot depth estimation. The proposed lightweight framework demonstrates superior performance with significantly reduced complexity.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation aims to recover the depth information of 3D scenes from 2D images. Recent work has made significant progress, but its reliance on large-scale datasets and complex decoders has limited its efficiency and generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and data-centric framework for zero-shot monocular depth estimation. We first adopt DINOv3 as the visual encoder to obtain high-quality dense features. Secondly, to address the inherent drawbacks of the complex structure of the DPT, we design the Simple Depth Transformer (SDT), a compact transformer-based decoder. Compared to the DPT, it uses a single-path feature fusion and upsampling process to reduce the computational overhead of cross-scale feature fusion, achieving higher accuracy while reducing the number of parameters by approximately 85%-89%. Furthermore, we propose a quality-based filtering strategy to filter out harmful samples, thereby reducing dataset size while improving overall training quality. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that our framework surpasses the DPT in accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AiOIR approaches rely heavily on degradation-specific representations, which often lead to oversmoothing and artifacts. The paper aims to address these limitations by developing a more robust framework that can handle complex real-world degradations more effectively.

Method: ClearAIR uses a hierarchical coarse-to-fine restoration strategy: 1) MLLM-based Image Quality Assessment for overall evaluation with cross-modal understanding, 2) Region awareness and task recognition pipeline with semantic cross-attention and degradation-aware modules, and 3) Internal clue reuse mechanism that operates self-supervised to mine intrinsic image information for detail restoration.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that ClearAIR achieves superior performance across diverse synthetic and real-world datasets compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed ClearAIR framework effectively addresses limitations of existing AiOIR methods by incorporating Human Visual Perception principles and a hierarchical restoration strategy, resulting in improved handling of complex degradations with better detail preservation.

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) has advanced significantly, offering promising solutions for complex real-world degradations. However, most existing approaches rely heavily on degradation-specific representations, often resulting in oversmoothing and artifacts. To address this, we propose ClearAIR, a novel AiOIR framework inspired by Human Visual Perception (HVP) and designed with a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine restoration strategy. First, leveraging the global priority of early HVP, we employ a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based Image Quality Assessment (IQA) model for overall evaluation. Unlike conventional IQA, our method integrates cross-modal understanding to more accurately characterize complex, composite degradations. Building upon this overall assessment, we then introduce a region awareness and task recognition pipeline. A semantic cross-attention, leveraging semantic guidance unit, first produces coarse semantic prompts. Guided by this regional context, a degradation-aware module implicitly captures region-specific degradation characteristics, enabling more precise local restoration. Finally, to recover fine details, we propose an internal clue reuse mechanism. It operates in a self-supervised manner to mine and leverage the intrinsic information of the image itself, substantially enhancing detail restoration. Experimental results show that ClearAIR achieves superior performance across diverse synthetic and real-world datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs have strong general multimodal reasoning but lack human-like abductive inference capabilities for incomplete visual observations. The paper aims to bridge this gap by mimicking human dual-mode cognition (verbal and pictorial abduction).

Method: Proposes AbductiveMLLM with two synergistic components: REASONER (verbal domain) that explores explanations using blind LLM, prunes visually incongruent hypotheses, and introduces targeted priors; and IMAGINER (pictorial domain) that uses text-to-image diffusion to "imagine" visual scenes corresponding to verbal explanations. Both components are trained end-to-end.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard VAR benchmarks, consistently outperforming traditional solutions and advanced MLLMs.

Conclusion: Mimicking human dual-mode cognition (verbal and pictorial abduction) effectively enhances MLLMs' abductive reasoning capabilities, bridging the gap between AI systems and human-level inference for incomplete visual observations.

Abstract: Visual abductive reasoning (VAR) is a challenging task that requires AI systems to infer the most likely explanation for incomplete visual observations. While recent MLLMs develop strong general-purpose multimodal reasoning capabilities, they fall short in abductive inference, as compared to human beings. To bridge this gap, we draw inspiration from the interplay between verbal and pictorial abduction in human cognition, and propose to strengthen abduction of MLLMs by mimicking such dual-mode behavior. Concretely, we introduce AbductiveMLLM comprising of two synergistic components: REASONER and IMAGINER. The REASONER operates in the verbal domain. It first explores a broad space of possible explanations using a blind LLM and then prunes visually incongruent hypotheses based on cross-modal causal alignment. The remaining hypotheses are introduced into the MLLM as targeted priors, steering its reasoning toward causally coherent explanations. The IMAGINER, on the other hand, further guides MLLMs by emulating human-like pictorial thinking. It conditions a text-to-image diffusion model on both the input video and the REASONER's output embeddings to "imagine" plausible visual scenes that correspond to verbal explanation, thereby enriching MLLMs' contextual grounding. The two components are trained jointly in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on standard VAR benchmarks show that AbductiveMLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming traditional solutions and advanced MLLMs.

TL;DR: EarthVLNet: A progressive Earth vision-language framework with EarthVLSet dataset for semantic segmentation and visual question answering in remote sensing, enabling object-relational reasoning for comprehensive scene understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Earth vision focuses on object recognition but lacks object-relational reasoning, limiting comprehensive scene understanding needed for applications like city planning.

Method: Progressive framework with EarthVLSet dataset (10.9k images, land-cover masks, 761.5k text pairs) and EarthVLNet network. Uses semantic segmentation to generate object semantics, then object-aware LLM for relational reasoning and VQA. Introduces numerical difference loss for optimization.

Result: Superior performance on three benchmarks: semantic segmentation, multiple-choice VQA, and open-ended VQA. Key findings: segmentation features enhance VQA even cross-dataset; multiple-choice tasks more sensitive to vision encoder; open-ended tasks need advanced vision and language models.

Conclusion: The dataset and method provide a benchmark connecting "image-mask-text" for advancing geographical applications in Earth vision, enabling comprehensive scene understanding through object-relational reasoning.

Abstract: Earth vision has achieved milestones in geospatial object recognition but lacks exploration in object-relational reasoning, limiting comprehensive scene understanding. To address this, a progressive Earth vision-language understanding and generation framework is proposed, including a multi-task dataset (EarthVLSet) and a semantic-guided network (EarthVLNet). Focusing on city planning applications, EarthVLSet includes 10.9k sub-meter resolution remote sensing images, land-cover masks, and 761.5k textual pairs involving both multiple-choice and open-ended visual question answering (VQA) tasks. In an object-centric way, EarthVLNet is proposed to progressively achieve semantic segmentation, relational reasoning, and comprehensive understanding. The first stage involves land-cover segmentation to generate object semantics for VQA guidance. Guided by pixel-wise semantics, the object awareness based large language model (LLM) performs relational reasoning and knowledge summarization to generate the required answers. As for optimization, the numerical difference loss is proposed to dynamically add difference penalties, addressing the various objects' statistics. Three benchmarks, including semantic segmentation, multiple-choice, and open-ended VQA demonstrated the superiorities of EarthVLNet, yielding three future directions: 1) segmentation features consistently enhance VQA performance even in cross-dataset scenarios; 2) multiple-choice tasks show greater sensitivity to the vision encoder than to the language decoder; and 3) open-ended tasks necessitate advanced vision encoders and language decoders for an optimal performance. We believe this dataset and method will provide a beneficial benchmark that connects ''image-mask-text'', advancing geographical applications for Earth vision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DreamStyle is a unified video stylization framework that supports text-guided, style-image-guided, and first-frame-guided stylization using a novel LoRA adaptation approach and high-quality curated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video stylization methods are limited to single style conditions (text, image, or first frame only), lack high-quality datasets, and suffer from style inconsistency and temporal flicker issues.

Method: Built on vanilla Image-to-Video (I2V) model with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) using token-specific up matrices to reduce confusion among different condition tokens, plus a well-designed data curation pipeline for high-quality paired video data.

Result: DreamStyle demonstrates competence in all three video stylization tasks and outperforms competitors in both style consistency and video quality through qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: DreamStyle provides a unified solution for video stylization that addresses the limitations of single-condition methods and dataset quality issues, enabling flexible and high-quality stylization across different input conditions.

Abstract: Video stylization, an important downstream task of video generation models, has not yet been thoroughly explored. Its input style conditions typically include text, style image, and stylized first frame. Each condition has a characteristic advantage: text is more flexible, style image provides a more accurate visual anchor, and stylized first frame makes long-video stylization feasible. However, existing methods are largely confined to a single type of style condition, which limits their scope of application. Additionally, their lack of high-quality datasets leads to style inconsistency and temporal flicker. To address these limitations, we introduce DreamStyle, a unified framework for video stylization, supporting (1) text-guided, (2) style-image-guided, and (3) first-frame-guided video stylization, accompanied by a well-designed data curation pipeline to acquire high-quality paired video data. DreamStyle is built on a vanilla Image-to-Video (I2V) model and trained using a Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with token-specific up matrices that reduces the confusion among different condition tokens. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that DreamStyle is competent in all three video stylization tasks, and outperforms the competitors in style consistency and video quality.

*Petteri Teikari,Neliana Fuenmayor*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Textile IR is a bidirectional intermediate representation that connects CAD, physics simulation, and lifecycle assessment for fashion design, enabling designers to navigate sustainability, manufacturability, and aesthetic tradeoffs simultaneously through a seven-layer Verification Ladder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fashion design tools are siloed - pattern software guarantees sewable outputs but doesn't understand drape, while physics simulation predicts behavior but can't automatically fix patterns. There's a need for integrated workflows that address compound uncertainty from measurement errors, simulation approximations, and LCA database gaps.

Method: Textile IR uses a seven-layer Verification Ladder from cheap syntactic checks (pattern closure, seam compatibility) to expensive physics validation (drape simulation, stress analysis). It formalizes fashion engineering as constraint satisfaction over three domains and uses a scene-graph representation that enables AI systems to manipulate garments as structured programs.

Result: The framework enables bidirectional feedback: simulation failures suggest pattern modifications; material substitutions update sustainability estimates in real time; uncertainty propagates across the pipeline with explicit confidence bounds. It makes engineering constraints perceptible, manipulable, and immediately consequential.

Conclusion: Textile IR provides a formal representation that enables designers to navigate sustainability, manufacturability, and aesthetic tradeoffs simultaneously rather than discovering conflicts after costly physical prototyping. The paper proposes six research priorities and discusses deployment considerations for fashion SMEs.

Abstract: We introduce Textile IR, a bidirectional intermediate representation that connects manufacturing-valid CAD, physics-based simulation, and lifecycle assessment for fashion design. Unlike existing siloed tools where pattern software guarantees sewable outputs but understands nothing about drape, and physics simulation predicts behaviour but cannot automatically fix patterns, Textile IR provides the semantic glue for integration through a seven-layer Verification Ladder -- from cheap syntactic checks (pattern closure, seam compatibility) to expensive physics validation (drape simulation, stress analysis). The architecture enables bidirectional feedback: simulation failures suggest pattern modifications; material substitutions update sustainability estimates in real time; uncertainty propagates across the pipeline with explicit confidence bounds. We formalise fashion engineering as constraint satisfaction over three domains and demonstrate how Textile IR's scene-graph representation enables AI systems to manipulate garments as structured programs rather than pixel arrays. The framework addresses the compound uncertainty problem: when measurement errors in material testing, simulation approximations, and LCA database gaps combine, sustainability claims become unreliable without explicit uncertainty tracking. We propose six research priorities and discuss deployment considerations for fashion SMEs where integrated workflows reduce specialised engineering requirements. Key contribution: a formal representation that makes engineering constraints perceptible, manipulable, and immediately consequential -- enabling designers to navigate sustainability, manufacturability, and aesthetic tradeoffs simultaneously rather than discovering conflicts after costly physical prototyping.

TL;DR: StableDPT adapts image-based depth estimation models for video by adding temporal layers with cross-attention to keyframes, improving temporal stability and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single image Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) models applied to videos suffer from temporal instability and flickering artifacts, creating a need for video-adapted solutions.

Method: Builds on Vision Transformer encoder and DPT head, adding temporal layers with efficient cross-attention to integrate information from keyframes across entire video sequences.

Result: Improved temporal consistency, competitive state-of-the-art performance, and 2x faster processing in real-world scenarios on multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: StableDPT effectively adapts image-based depth models for video with minimal training requirements, achieving stable, accurate, and efficient video depth estimation.

Abstract: Applying single image Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) models to video sequences introduces significant temporal instability and flickering artifacts. We propose a novel approach that adapts any state-of-the-art image-based (depth) estimation model for video processing by integrating a new temporal module - trainable on a single GPU in a few days. Our architecture StableDPT builds upon an off-the-shelf Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder and enhances the Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT) head. The core of our contribution lies in the temporal layers within the head, which use an efficient cross-attention mechanism to integrate information from keyframes sampled across the entire video sequence. This allows the model to capture global context and inter-frame relationships leading to more accurate and temporally stable depth predictions. Furthermore, we propose a novel inference strategy for processing videos of arbitrary length avoiding the scale misalignment and redundant computations associated with overlapping windows used in other methods. Evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate improved temporal consistency, competitive state-of-the-art performance and on top 2x faster processing in real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel topology-aware framework for virtual staining that converts H&E images to IHC images using graph contrastive learning and topological constraints to handle spatial misalignments in weakly-paired data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IHC staining is crucial for cancer diagnosis but is complex, time-consuming, and expensive compared to H&E staining. Virtual staining offers a cost-effective alternative, but existing methods struggle with weakly-paired data from adjacent slides that have spatial misalignments and local deformations.

Method: Proposes a topology-aware framework with two key mechanisms: 1) Topology-aware Consistency Matching (TACM) using graph contrastive learning and topological perturbations to learn robust matching patterns despite spatial misalignments, and 2) Topology-constrained Pathological Matching (TCPM) that aligns pathological positive regions based on node importance to enhance pathological consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments on two benchmarks across four staining tasks demonstrate that the method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior generation quality with higher clinical relevance.

Conclusion: The proposed topology-aware framework effectively addresses the challenges of weakly-paired data in virtual staining, providing a robust solution for converting H&E to IHC images with improved clinical utility.

Abstract: Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining provides crucial molecular characterization of tissue samples and plays an indispensable role in the clinical examination and diagnosis of cancers. However, compared with the commonly used Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining, IHC staining involves complex procedures and is both time-consuming and expensive, which limits its widespread clinical use. Virtual staining converts H&E images to IHC images, offering a cost-effective alternative to clinical IHC staining. Nevertheless, using adjacent slides as ground truth often results in weakly-paired data with spatial misalignment and local deformations, hindering effective supervised learning. To address these challenges, we propose a novel topology-aware framework for H&E-to-IHC virtual staining. Specifically, we introduce a Topology-aware Consistency Matching (TACM) mechanism that employs graph contrastive learning and topological perturbations to learn robust matching patterns despite spatial misalignments, ensuring structural consistency. Furthermore, we propose a Topology-constrained Pathological Matching (TCPM) mechanism that aligns pathological positive regions based on node importance to enhance pathological consistency. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks across four staining tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior generation quality with higher clinical relevance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SketchThinker-R1 reduces reasoning token costs by 64% while maintaining accuracy by teaching multimodal models to use concise, goal-directed sketch-style reasoning instead of lengthy step-by-step reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large multimodal models use extensive step-by-step reasoning that incurs high computational overhead (token costs and response time), while humans use more efficient sketch-style reasoning that prioritizes salient information for faster problem-solving.

Method: Three-stage approach: 1) Sketch-Mode Cold Start - convert standard reasoning to sketch-style and finetune base model; 2) Train SketchJudge Reward Model to evaluate and score sketch-style reasoning; 3) Sketch-Thinking Reinforcement Learning supervised by SketchJudge to generalize sketch-style reasoning ability.

Result: Achieves over 64% reduction in reasoning token cost without compromising final answer accuracy on four benchmarks. Qualitative analysis shows sketch-style reasoning focuses more on key cues during problem solving.

Conclusion: SketchThinker-R1 successfully enables multimodal models to adopt human-like sketch-style reasoning, significantly improving inference efficiency while maintaining accuracy, demonstrating the value of cognitive-inspired approaches to model optimization.

Abstract: Despite the empirical success of extensive, step-by-step reasoning in large multimodal models, long reasoning processes inevitably incur substantial computational overhead, i.e., in terms of higher token costs and increased response time, which undermines inference efficiency. In contrast, humans often employ sketch-style reasoning: a concise, goal-directed cognitive process that prioritizes salient information and enables efficient problem-solving. Inspired by this cognitive efficiency, we propose SketchThinker-R1, which incentivizes sketch-style reasoning ability in large multimodal models. Our method consists of three primary stages. In the Sketch-Mode Cold Start stage, we convert standard long reasoning process into sketch-style reasoning and finetune base multimodal model, instilling initial sketch-style reasoning capability. Next, we train SketchJudge Reward Model, which explicitly evaluates thinking process of model and assigns higher scores to sketch-style reasoning. Finally, we conduct Sketch-Thinking Reinforcement Learning under supervision of SketchJudge to further generalize sketch-style reasoning ability. Experimental evaluation on four benchmarks reveals that our SketchThinker-R1 achieves over 64% reduction in reasoning token cost without compromising final answer accuracy. Qualitative analysis further shows that sketch-style reasoning focuses more on key cues during problem solving.

TL;DR: DGA-Net adapts SAM for camouflaged object detection using dense depth prompts, with cross-modal graph enhancement and anchor-guided refinement modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing COD methods don't fully exploit depth cues and rely on sparse prompts (points/boxes), limiting their ability to capture comprehensive depth information for better camouflaged object detection.

Method: Introduces DGA-Net with two key modules: 1) Cross-modal Graph Enhancement (CGE) synthesizes RGB semantics and depth geometry in a heterogeneous graph, and 2) Anchor-Guided Refinement (AGR) creates global anchors with non-local pathways to broadcast guidance from deep to shallow layers.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative experiments show DGA-Net outperforms state-of-the-art COD methods.

Conclusion: The proposed depth prompting paradigm and DGA-Net framework effectively leverage depth cues for superior camouflaged object detection performance.

Abstract: To fully exploit depth cues in Camouflaged Object Detection (COD), we present DGA-Net, a specialized framework that adapts the Segment Anything Model (SAM) via a novel ``depth prompting" paradigm. Distinguished from existing approaches that primarily rely on sparse prompts (e.g., points or boxes), our method introduces a holistic mechanism for constructing and propagating dense depth prompts. Specifically, we propose a Cross-modal Graph Enhancement (CGE) module that synthesizes RGB semantics and depth geometric within a heterogeneous graph to form a unified guidance signal. Furthermore, we design an Anchor-Guided Refinement (AGR) module. To counteract the inherent information decay in feature hierarchies, AGR forges a global anchor and establishes direct non-local pathways to broadcast this guidance from deep to shallow layers, ensuring precise and consistent segmentation. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that our proposed DGA-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art COD methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEF-DETR is a novel DETR-based framework that improves infrared small target detection by refining query initialization through frequency-guided patch screening, dynamic embedding enhancement, and reliability-consistency-aware fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DETR-based detectors suffer performance degradation in infrared small target detection because target-relevant embeddings get overwhelmed by dominant background features due to self-attention mechanisms, leading to unreliable query initialization and inaccurate localization.

Method: SEF-DETR consists of three components: 1) Frequency-guided Patch Screening (FPS) uses Fourier spectrum of local patches to create target-relevant density maps and suppress background features; 2) Dynamic Embedding Enhancement (DEE) strengthens multi-scale representations in a target-aware manner; 3) Reliability-Consistency-aware Fusion (RCF) refines object queries by enforcing spatial-frequency consistency and reliability.

Result: Extensive experiments on three public IRSTD datasets show SEF-DETR achieves superior detection performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, providing a robust and efficient solution for infrared small target detection.

Conclusion: SEF-DETR effectively addresses the query initialization problem in DETR-based infrared small target detection by leveraging frequency analysis and consistency-aware fusion, demonstrating significant performance improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) faces significant challenges due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), small target size, and complex cluttered backgrounds. Although recent DETR-based detectors benefit from global context modeling, they exhibit notable performance degradation on IRSTD. We revisit this phenomenon and reveal that the target-relevant embeddings of IRST are inevitably overwhelmed by dominant background features due to the self-attention mechanism, leading to unreliable query initialization and inaccurate target localization. To address this issue, we propose SEF-DETR, a novel framework that refines query initialization for IRSTD. Specifically, SEF-DETR consists of three components: Frequency-guided Patch Screening (FPS), Dynamic Embedding Enhancement (DEE), and Reliability-Consistency-aware Fusion (RCF). The FPS module leverages the Fourier spectrum of local patches to construct a target-relevant density map, suppressing background-dominated features. DEE strengthens multi-scale representations in a target-aware manner, while RCF further refines object queries by enforcing spatial-frequency consistency and reliability. Extensive experiments on three public IRSTD datasets demonstrate that SEF-DETR achieves superior detection performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, delivering a robust and efficient solution for infrared small target detection task.

TL;DR: A diffusion-based framework for universal image segmentation that predicts full segmentation holistically without mask-based frameworks, using location-aware palette with 2D gray code ordering and tanh activation for discrete data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a universal image segmentation framework that doesn't depend on traditional mask-based approaches, enabling holistic segmentation prediction and principled ambiguity modeling that current mask-based architectures lack.

Method: Diffusion-based framework with key adaptations: location-aware palette with 2D gray code ordering, tanh activation for discrete data, sigmoid loss weighting optimization, and x-prediction approach.

Result: The model narrows the performance gap with leading mask-based architectures while introducing unique capabilities like principled ambiguity modeling. It doesn't yet surpass state-of-the-art mask-based models but shows promising potential.

Conclusion: While current performance doesn't exceed mask-based architectures, the framework demonstrates viability and unique advantages. Future improvements with large-scale pretraining or promptable conditioning could make it competitive.

Abstract: This paper introduces a diffusion-based framework for universal image segmentation, making agnostic segmentation possible without depending on mask-based frameworks and instead predicting the full segmentation in a holistic manner. We present several key adaptations to diffusion models, which are important in this discrete setting. Notably, we show that a location-aware palette with our 2D gray code ordering improves performance. Adding a final tanh activation function is crucial for discrete data. On optimizing diffusion parameters, the sigmoid loss weighting consistently outperforms alternatives, regardless of the prediction type used, and we settle on x-prediction. While our current model does not yet surpass leading mask-based architectures, it narrows the performance gap and introduces unique capabilities, such as principled ambiguity modeling, that these models lack. All models were trained from scratch, and we believe that combining our proposed improvements with large-scale pretraining or promptable conditioning could lead to competitive models.

TL;DR: TA-Prompting enhances VideoLLMs with Temporal Anchors for precise event localization and temporal-aware video understanding, plus event coherent sampling for caption selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VideoLLMs struggle with identifying precise event boundaries in untrimmed videos, causing generated captions to be poorly grounded temporally.

Method: Proposes TA-Prompting with Temporal Anchors that learn to precisely localize events and prompt VideoLLMs for temporal-aware understanding, plus event coherent sampling strategy to select coherent event captions.

Result: Superior performance on benchmark datasets for dense video captioning and temporal understanding tasks including moment retrieval and temporalQA.

Conclusion: TA-Prompting effectively addresses temporal grounding challenges in VideoLLMs and improves dense video captioning performance.

Abstract: Dense video captioning aims to interpret and describe all temporally localized events throughout an input video. Recent state-of-the-art methods leverage large language models (LLMs) to provide detailed moment descriptions for video data. However, existing VideoLLMs remain challenging in identifying precise event boundaries in untrimmed videos, causing the generated captions to be not properly grounded. In this paper, we propose TA-Prompting, which enhances VideoLLMs via Temporal Anchors that learn to precisely localize events and prompt the VideoLLMs to perform temporal-aware video event understanding. During inference, in order to properly determine the output caption sequence from an arbitrary number of events presented within a video, we introduce an event coherent sampling strategy to select event captions with sufficient coherence across temporal events and cross-modal similarity with the given video. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we show that our TA-Prompting is favorable against state-of-the-art VideoLLMs, yielding superior performance on dense video captioning and temporal understanding tasks including moment retrieval and temporalQA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IQA methods either provide numerical scores without explanation or give low-level descriptions without precise scores. Recent VLM-based approaches show promise but suffer from unreliable reasoning due to limited integration of visual and textual cues.

Method: Two-stage training: 1) Supervised fine-tuning on GR-IQA dataset to teach region grounding, and 2) Reinforcement learning with KL-Coverage regularizer to prevent reasoning collapse and Progressive Re-sampling Strategy to mitigate annotation bias.

Result: Extensive experiments show Zoom-IQA achieves improved robustness, explainability, and generalization. Application to downstream tasks like image restoration demonstrates its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Zoom-IQA successfully emulates key cognitive behaviors for IQA, addressing limitations of previous methods by providing both precise scores and explainable assessments grounded in visual regions.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) is a long-standing problem in computer vision. Previous methods typically focus on predicting numerical scores without explanation or provide low-level descriptions lacking precise scores. Recent reasoning-based vision language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential for IQA, enabling joint generation of quality descriptions and scores. However, we notice that existing VLM-based IQA methods tend to exhibit unreliable reasoning due to their limited capability of integrating visual and textual cues. In this work, we introduce Zoom-IQA, a VLM-based IQA model to explicitly emulate key cognitive behaviors: uncertainty awareness, region reasoning, and iterative refinement. Specifically, we present a two-stage training pipeline: 1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our Grounded-Rationale-IQA (GR-IQA) dataset to teach the model to ground its assessments in key regions; and 2) reinforcement learning (RL) for dynamic policy exploration, primarily stabilized by our KL-Coverage regularizer to prevent reasoning and scoring diversity collapse, and supported by a Progressive Re-sampling Strategy to mitigate annotation bias. Extensive experiments show that Zoom-IQA achieves improved robustness, explainability, and generalization. The application to downstream tasks, such as image restoration, further demonstrates the effectiveness of Zoom-IQA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCG-ReID proposes a disentangled fusion framework with dynamic confidence-based weighting and two scenario-specific fusion strategies for multi-modal vehicle ReID, addressing conflicts between balanced and unbalanced quality distributions across RGB, NIR, and TIR modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal vehicle ReID methods use a single fusion model for all data, overlooking different needs of balanced vs unbalanced quality distributions, and failing to decouple conflicts between intra-class consistency and inter-modal heterogeneity.

Method: Proposes DCG-ReID with: 1) Dynamic Confidence-based Disentangling Weighting (DCDW) to reweight modal contributions via interaction-derived confidence; 2) Collaboration Fusion Module (CFM) for balanced distributions to mine pairwise consensus features; 3) Guidance Fusion Module (GFM) for unbalanced distributions to amplify dominant modality advantages and guide auxiliary modalities.

Result: Extensive experiments on three multi-modal ReID benchmarks (WMVeID863, MSVR310, RGBNT100) validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: DCG-ReID successfully addresses the challenges of multi-modal vehicle ReID by disentangling heterogeneous quality-distributed modal data and providing scenario-specific fusion strategies, achieving superior performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Multi-modal vehicle Re-Identification (ReID) aims to leverage complementary information from RGB, Near Infrared (NIR), and Thermal Infrared (TIR) modalities to retrieve the same vehicle. The challenges of multi-modal vehicle ReID arise from the uncertainty of modality quality distribution induced by inherent discrepancies across modalities, resulting in distinct conflicting fusion requirements for data with balanced and unbalanced quality distributions. Existing methods handle all multi-modal data within a single fusion model, overlooking the different needs of the two data types and making it difficult to decouple the conflict between intra-class consistency and inter-modal heterogeneity. To this end, we propose Disentangle Collaboration and Guidance Fusion Representations for Multi-modal Vehicle ReID (DCG-ReID). Specifically, to disentangle heterogeneous quality-distributed modal data without mutual interference, we first design the Dynamic Confidence-based Disentangling Weighting (DCDW) mechanism: dynamically reweighting three-modal contributions via interaction-derived modal confidence to build a disentangled fusion framework. Building on DCDW, we develop two scenario-specific fusion strategies: (1) for balanced quality distributions, Collaboration Fusion Module (CFM) mines pairwise consensus features to capture shared discriminative information and boost intra-class consistency; (2) for unbalanced distributions, Guidance Fusion Module (GFM) implements differential amplification of modal discriminative disparities to reinforce dominant modality advantages, guide auxiliary modalities to mine complementary discriminative info, and mitigate inter-modal divergence to boost multi-modal joint decision performance. Extensive experiments on three multi-modal ReID benchmarks (WMVeID863, MSVR310, RGBNT100) validate the effectiveness of our method. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Motivation: Existing VAU approaches rely on fine-tuned MLLMs or external modules like video captioners, which require costly annotations, complex training pipelines, and high inference overhead, making them impractical for real-world applications.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) coarse anomaly scoring via similarity to textual anchors, and (2) MLLM-based refinement with contextualized prompts. Both textual anchors and prompts are optimized using weakly supervised Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) framework.

Result: Extensive experiments on standard VAD benchmarks show competitive detection performance and interpretable anomaly explanations without instruction tuning, frame-level annotations, external modules, or dense processing.

Conclusion: PrismVAU provides an efficient and practical solution for real-world VAU applications by leveraging a single off-the-shelf MLLM with optimized prompts, enabling real-time performance without complex training pipelines.

Abstract: Video Anomaly Understanding (VAU) extends traditional Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) by not only localizing anomalies but also describing and reasoning about their context. Existing VAU approaches often rely on fine-tuned multimodal large language models (MLLMs) or external modules such as video captioners, which introduce costly annotations, complex training pipelines, and high inference overhead. In this work, we introduce PrismVAU, a lightweight yet effective system for real-time VAU that leverages a single off-the-shelf MLLM for anomaly scoring, explanation, and prompt optimization. PrismVAU operates in two complementary stages: (1) a coarse anomaly scoring module that computes frame-level anomaly scores via similarity to textual anchors, and (2) an MLLM-based refinement module that contextualizes anomalies through system and user prompts. Both textual anchors and prompts are optimized with a weakly supervised Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) framework. Extensive experiments on standard VAD benchmarks demonstrate that PrismVAU delivers competitive detection performance and interpretable anomaly explanations -- without relying on instruction tuning, frame-level annotations, and external modules or dense processing -- making it an efficient and practical solution for real-world applications.

TL;DR: HybridSolarNet: A lightweight EfficientNet-B0 + CBAM model for UAV-based solar panel fault detection with 92.37% accuracy, 54.9 FPS inference, and 32x smaller than VGG19.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual solar panel inspections are tedious, costly, and error-prone. Existing deep learning methods are either too large for edge devices or suffer from biased accuracy estimation due to ineffective learning techniques.

Method: Proposed HybridSolarNet integrates EfficientNet-B0 with Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM). Uses tight split-before-augmentation protocol to avoid leakage, focal loss for class imbalance, and cosine annealing. Evaluated on Kaggle Solar Panel Images dataset with 5-fold stratified cross-validation.

Result: Achieved 92.37% ± 0.41 average accuracy and F1-score of 0.9226 ± 0.39. Model requires only 16.3 MB storage (32x smaller than VGG19) with 54.9 FPS inference speed. CBAM contributed +1.53% accuracy boost, and focal loss helped with imbalanced classes.

Conclusion: HybridSolarNet is a lightweight, accurate model suitable for real-time UAV implementation with efficient edge computing capabilities and interpretable attention mechanisms via Grad-CAM visualization.

Abstract: Manual inspections for solar panel systems are a tedious, costly, and error-prone task, making it desirable for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based monitoring. Though deep learning models have excellent fault detection capabilities, almost all methods either are too large and heavy for edge computing devices or involve biased estimation of accuracy due to ineffective learning techniques. We propose a new solar panel fault detection model called HybridSolarNet. It integrates EfficientNet-B0 with Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM). We implemented it on the Kaggle Solar Panel Images competition dataset with a tight split-before-augmentation protocol. It avoids leakage in accuracy estimation. We introduced focal loss and cosine annealing. Ablation analysis validates that accuracy boosts due to added benefits from CBAM (+1.53%) and that there are benefits from recognition of classes with imbalanced samples via focal loss. Overall average accuracy on 5-fold stratified cross-validation experiments on the given competition dataset topped 92.37% +/- 0.41 and an F1-score of 0.9226 +/- 0.39 compared to baselines like VGG19, requiring merely 16.3 MB storage, i.e., 32 times less. Its inference speed measured at 54.9 FPS with GPU support makes it a successful candidate for real-time UAV implementation. Moreover, visualization obtained from Grad-CAM illustrates that HybridSolarNet focuses on actual locations instead of irrelevant ones.

*Chengcheng Feng,Haojie Yin,Yucheng Jin,Kaizhu Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel comic reasoning framework improves small MLLMs' performance on comic-based VQA by addressing CoT limitations through modular generation, GRPO fine-tuning, and structured rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Chain-of-Thought prompting degrades performance in comic-based VQA, especially for small models, due to state entanglement, spurious transitions, and exploration inefficiency issues.

Method: Proposes a comic reasoning framework combining modular CoT generation with GRPO-based reinforcement fine-tuning and a novel structured reward mechanism.

Result: The 3B model outperforms SOTA methods across five challenging benchmarks, with plug-in experiments yielding additional 12.1% average improvement across different MLLMs.

Conclusion: The framework enables more faithful and transferable reasoning chains for small MLLMs, effectively addressing comic VQA challenges and extending to broader humor-centric and abstract visual reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Comic-based visual question answering (CVQA) poses distinct challenges to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) due to its reliance on symbolic abstraction, narrative logic, and humor, which differ from conventional VQA tasks. Although Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is widely used to enhance MLLM reasoning, surprisingly, its direct application to CVQA often degrades performance, especially in small-scale models. Our theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that standard CoT in CVQA suffers from state entanglement, spurious transitions, and exploration inefficiency, with small models particularly vulnerable in resource-constrained settings. To address these issues, we propose a novel comic reasoning framework, designed to produce more faithful and transferable reasoning chains in small MLLMs. Specifically, our framework combines modular CoT generation with GRPO-based reinforcement fine-tuning and a novel structured reward. Beyond comic VQA, we further evaluate our approach on a broader class of humor-centric and abstract visual reasoning tasks, including meme understanding and editorial cartoon interpretation. Across five challenging benchmarks, our 3B model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and plug-in experiments yield an additional average improvement of $\mathbf{12.1\%}$ across different MLLMs.

*Li Wang,Boqi Li,Hang Chen,Xingjian Wu,Yichen Wang,Jiewen Tan,Xinyu Zhang,Huaping Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RiSe is a vehicle-infrastructure collaborative perception framework that reduces communication bandwidth by 99.29% while maintaining detection accuracy through risk-intent selective feature transmission.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VICP systems face a critical bottleneck in balancing communication bandwidth and feature redundancy. Existing approaches inefficiently transmit spatially redundant features from non-critical background regions, wasting bandwidth on unimportant areas.

Method: RiSe introduces two key components: 1) Potential Field-Trajectory Correlation Model (PTCM) using potential field theory to assess kinematic risks, and 2) Intention-Driven Area Prediction Module (IDAPM) leveraging ego-motion priors to predict key BEV areas. These enable semantic-selective fusion that transmits only high-fidelity features from high-interaction regions.

Result: Extensive experiments on DeepAccident dataset show RiSe reduces communication volume to 0.71% of full feature sharing while maintaining state-of-the-art detection accuracy, establishing a competitive Pareto frontier between bandwidth efficiency and perception performance.

Conclusion: RiSe successfully shifts the paradigm from identifying visible regions to prioritizing risk-critical ones, effectively acting as a feature denoiser that significantly reduces communication overhead while preserving detection performance in vehicle-infrastructure collaborative perception systems.

Abstract: Vehicle-Infrastructure Collaborative Perception (VICP) is pivotal for resolving occlusion in autonomous driving, yet the trade-off between communication bandwidth and feature redundancy remains a critical bottleneck. While intermediate fusion mitigates data volume compared to raw sharing, existing frameworks typically rely on spatial compression or static confidence maps, which inefficiently transmit spatially redundant features from non-critical background regions. To address this, we propose Risk-intent Selective detection (RiSe), an interaction-aware framework that shifts the paradigm from identifying visible regions to prioritizing risk-critical ones. Specifically, we introduce a Potential Field-Trajectory Correlation Model (PTCM) grounded in potential field theory to quantitatively assess kinematic risks. Complementing this, an Intention-Driven Area Prediction Module (IDAPM) leverages ego-motion priors to proactively predict and filter key Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) areas essential for decision-making. By integrating these components, RiSe implements a semantic-selective fusion scheme that transmits high-fidelity features only from high-interaction regions, effectively acting as a feature denoiser. Extensive experiments on the DeepAccident dataset demonstrate that our method reduces communication volume to 0.71\% of full feature sharing while maintaining state-of-the-art detection accuracy, establishing a competitive Pareto frontier between bandwidth efficiency and perception performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReCCur is a low-compute framework that converts noisy web imagery into auditable fine-grained labels for corner-case scenarios using a multi-agent recursive pipeline with minimal human supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Corner cases (rare/extreme scenarios causing real-world failures) are difficult to curate at scale due to noisy web data, brittle labels, and edge deployment constraints that preclude large retraining.

Method: Three-stage recursive pipeline: 1) Large-scale data acquisition/filtering with VLM for tri-modal consistency, 2) Mixture-of-experts knowledge distillation with complementary encoders and dual-confidence activation, 3) Region-evidence VLM adversarial labeling with proposer-validator pairing for explainable labels.

Result: On realistic corner-case scenarios (e.g., flooded-car inspection), ReCCur runs on consumer-grade GPUs, steadily improves purity and separability, requires minimal human supervision, and provides practical substrate for downstream training/evaluation under resource constraints.

Conclusion: ReCCur offers a practical framework for scalable corner-case curation with low compute requirements, minimal human intervention, and auditable fine-grained labels suitable for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Corner cases are rare or extreme scenarios that drive real-world failures, but they are difficult to curate at scale: web data are noisy, labels are brittle, and edge deployments preclude large retraining. We present ReCCur (Recursive Corner-Case Curation), a low-compute framework that converts noisy web imagery into auditable fine-grained labels via a multi-agent recursive pipeline. First, large-scale data acquisition and filtering expands a domain vocabulary with a vision-language model (VLM), crawls the web, and enforces tri-modal (image, description, keyword) consistency with light human spot checks to yield refined candidates. Next, mixture-of-experts knowledge distillation uses complementary encoders (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2, BEiT) for kNN voting with dual-confidence activation and uncertainty sampling, converging to a high-precision set. Finally, region-evidence VLM adversarial labeling pairs a proposer (multi-granularity regions and semantic cues) with a validator (global and local chained consistency) to produce explainable labels and close the loop. On realistic corner-case scenarios (e.g., flooded-car inspection), ReCCur runs on consumer-grade GPUs, steadily improves purity and separability, and requires minimal human supervision, providing a practical substrate for downstream training and evaluation under resource constraints. Code and dataset will be released.

TL;DR: SA-ResGS improves 3D Gaussian Splatting for active scene reconstruction by stabilizing uncertainty quantification and enhancing supervision through self-augmented point clouds and residual learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges in next-best-view selection for active scene reconstruction: unreliable uncertainty quantification, under-supervised Gaussians due to sparse/wide-baseline views, and conflicting effects between exploration and sparse-view ambiguity.

Method: Uses Self-Augmented point clouds via triangulation between training and extrapolated views for coverage estimation. Introduces residual learning for 3D Gaussian Splatting with uncertainty-driven filtering and dropout/hard-negative-mining-inspired sampling to enhance gradient flow in high-uncertainty Gaussians.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both reconstruction quality and view selection robustness for active view selection tasks.

Conclusion: SA-ResGS provides a comprehensive solution for uncertainty-aware active scene reconstruction with three key contributions: physically grounded view selection, uncertainty-aware residual supervision, and implicit unbiasing of uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: We propose Self-Augmented Residual 3D Gaussian Splatting (SA-ResGS), a novel framework to stabilize uncertainty quantification and enhancing uncertainty-aware supervision in next-best-view (NBV) selection for active scene reconstruction. SA-ResGS improves both the reliability of uncertainty estimates and their effectiveness for supervision by generating Self-Augmented point clouds (SA-Points) via triangulation between a training view and a rasterized extrapolated view, enabling efficient scene coverage estimation. While improving scene coverage through physically guided view selection, SA-ResGS also addresses the challenge of under-supervised Gaussians, exacerbated by sparse and wide-baseline views, by introducing the first residual learning strategy tailored for 3D Gaussian Splatting. This targeted supervision enhances gradient flow in high-uncertainty Gaussians by combining uncertainty-driven filtering with dropout- and hard-negative-mining-inspired sampling. Our contributions are threefold: (1) a physically grounded view selection strategy that promotes efficient and uniform scene coverage; (2) an uncertainty-aware residual supervision scheme that amplifies learning signals for weakly contributing Gaussians, improving training stability and uncertainty estimation across scenes with diverse camera distributions; (3) an implicit unbiasing of uncertainty quantification as a consequence of constrained view selection and residual supervision, which together mitigate conflicting effects of wide-baseline exploration and sparse-view ambiguity in NBV planning. Experiments on active view selection demonstrate that SA-ResGS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both reconstruction quality and view selection robustness.

*Ali Kashefi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two new geometric deep learning frameworks (Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet) that use PointNet with flow matching and diffusion models to predict fluid flow variables on irregular geometries directly from point clouds, outperforming vanilla PointNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for predicting fluid flow on irregular geometries have limitations: pixelation approaches project geometries onto uniform lattices, and graph neural network-based diffusion models produce high-frequency noise artifacts and require complex auxiliary networks for geometry conditioning.

Method: Incorporates PointNet into flow matching and diffusion models to create two frameworks that operate directly on point-cloud representations of computational domains. A reverse generative process reconstructs physical fields from Gaussian noise conditioned on unseen geometries, using only PointNet for a simple unified architecture.

Result: The frameworks achieve more accurate predictions of velocity and pressure fields, as well as lift and drag forces, compared to vanilla PointNet with the same parameters. They also exhibit greater robustness to incomplete geometries and avoid the high-frequency noise artifacts of graph neural network-based approaches.

Conclusion: Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet provide effective, unified architectures for predicting fluid flow on irregular geometries directly from point clouds, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and robustness while avoiding their limitations.

Abstract: We present two novel generative geometric deep learning frameworks, termed Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet, for predicting fluid flow variables on irregular geometries by incorporating PointNet into flow matching and diffusion models, respectively. In these frameworks, a reverse generative process reconstructs physical fields from standard Gaussian noise conditioned on unseen geometries. The proposed approaches operate directly on point-cloud representations of computational domains (e.g., grid vertices of finite-volume meshes) and therefore avoid the limitations of pixelation used to project geometries onto uniform lattices. In contrast to graph neural network-based diffusion models, Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet do not exhibit high-frequency noise artifacts in the predicted fields. Moreover, unlike such approaches, which require auxiliary intermediate networks to condition geometry, the proposed frameworks rely solely on PointNet, resulting in a simple and unified architecture. The performance of the proposed frameworks is evaluated on steady incompressible flow past a cylinder, using a geometric dataset constructed by varying the cylinder's cross-sectional shape and orientation across samples. The results demonstrate that Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet achieve more accurate predictions of velocity and pressure fields, as well as lift and drag forces, and exhibit greater robustness to incomplete geometries compared to a vanilla PointNet with the same number of trainable parameters.

*Han Zhang,Yanwei Wang,Fang Li,Hongjun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DFRCP is a plug-in module for YOLOv11 that enhances blur-robust object detection by combining multi-scale features with adaptive fuzzy feature injection, achieving 10.4% higher accuracy on blurred images with minimal latency overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion blur from camera shake degrades object detection performance. Existing approaches either treat blur as noise (losing structure) or use full restoration (increasing latency), making them unsuitable for resource-constrained edge devices.

Method: DFRCP enhances YOLOv11's feature pyramid by: 1) Combining large and medium scale features while preserving native representations, 2) Introducing Dynamic Robust Switch units that adaptively inject fuzzy features for global perception, 3) Synthesizing fuzzy features through rotation and nonlinear interpolation, 4) Using transparency convolution for content-adaptive fusion, and 5) Implementing CUDA-optimized kernels for 400x speedup.

Result: On a private wheat pest damage dataset (3,500 images with blur augmentation), YOLOv11 with DFRCP achieves ~10.4% higher accuracy than baseline YOLOv11 on blurred test sets, with only modest training time overhead and practical edge deployment capability.

Conclusion: DFRCP provides an effective plug-in solution for blur-robust object detection that balances accuracy and efficiency, reducing the need for manual filtering after data collection while being suitable for edge deployment through CUDA optimization.

Abstract: Motion blur caused by camera shake produces ghosting artifacts that substantially degrade edge side object detection. Existing approaches either suppress blur as noise and lose discriminative structure, or apply full image restoration that increases latency and limits deployment on resource constrained devices. We propose DFRCP, a Dynamic Fuzzy Robust Convolutional Pyramid, as a plug in upgrade to YOLOv11 for blur robust detection. DFRCP enhances the YOLOv11 feature pyramid by combining large scale and medium scale features while preserving native representations, and by introducing Dynamic Robust Switch units that adaptively inject fuzzy features to strengthen global perception under jitter. Fuzzy features are synthesized by rotating and nonlinearly interpolating multiscale features, then merged through a transparency convolution that learns a content adaptive trade off between original and fuzzy cues. We further develop a CUDA parallel rotation and interpolation kernel that avoids boundary overflow and delivers more than 400 times speedup, making the design practical for edge deployment. We train with paired supervision on a private wheat pest damage dataset of about 3,500 images, augmented threefold using two blur regimes, uniform image wide motion blur and bounding box confined rotational blur. On blurred test sets, YOLOv11 with DFRCP achieves about 10.4 percent higher accuracy than the YOLOv11 baseline with only a modest training time overhead, reducing the need for manual filtering after data collection.

*Siyi Lyu,Quan Liu,Feng Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViTs fail at spatial reasoning due to architectural complexity limits - they can't efficiently capture non-solvable group structures like 3D rotations, creating a fundamental complexity gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers perform well on semantic tasks but systematically fail at spatial reasoning like mental rotation. The paper investigates whether this is due to data limitations or intrinsic architectural constraints, proposing it's an inherent complexity limitation.

Method: Formalize spatial understanding as learning group homomorphisms that preserve algebraic structure. Analyze computational complexity: show that for non-solvable groups (e.g., SO(3)), structure-preserving embeddings require NC^1-complete computation, while constant-depth ViTs are bounded by TC^0. Validate with latent-space probing experiments.

Result: Established a complexity boundary: constant-depth ViTs fundamentally lack the logical depth to efficiently capture non-solvable spatial structures. Latent-space probing shows ViT representations suffer structural collapse on non-solvable tasks as compositional depth increases.

Conclusion: ViTs' spatial reasoning failures stem from intrinsic architectural complexity limits, not just data scale. There's a fundamental complexity gap (TC^0 vs NC^1) preventing efficient learning of non-solvable spatial structures, explaining systematic failures in tasks like mental rotation.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) excel in semantic recognition but exhibit systematic failures in spatial reasoning tasks such as mental rotation. While often attributed to data scale, we propose that this limitation arises from the intrinsic circuit complexity of the architecture. We formalize spatial understanding as learning a Group Homomorphism: mapping image sequences to a latent space that preserves the algebraic structure of the underlying transformation group. We demonstrate that for non-solvable groups (e.g., the 3D rotation group $\mathrm{SO}(3)$), maintaining such a structure-preserving embedding is computationally lower-bounded by the Word Problem, which is $\mathsf{NC^1}$-complete. In contrast, we prove that constant-depth ViTs with polynomial precision are strictly bounded by $\mathsf{TC^0}$. Under the conjecture $\mathsf{TC^0} \subsetneq \mathsf{NC^1}$, we establish a complexity boundary: constant-depth ViTs fundamentally lack the logical depth to efficiently capture non-solvable spatial structures. We validate this complexity gap via latent-space probing, demonstrating that ViT representations suffer a structural collapse on non-solvable tasks as compositional depth increases.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IBISAgent is an agentic MLLM that reformulates medical image segmentation as a multi-step decision-making process, enabling iterative refinement through reasoning and text-based click actions without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical MLLM segmentation approaches have two main problems: 1) They require simultaneous fine-tuning of MLLMs and external pixel decoders, risking catastrophic forgetting and poor out-of-domain generalization; 2) They rely on single-pass reasoning without iterative refinement capabilities, leading to suboptimal segmentation results.

Method: IBISAgent treats segmentation as a vision-centric, multi-step decision-making process where the MLLM generates interleaved reasoning and text-based click actions to invoke segmentation tools. It uses a two-stage training framework: cold-start supervised fine-tuning followed by agentic reinforcement learning with fine-grained rewards. The model iteratively performs visual reasoning on masked image features to support mask refinement.

Result: Extensive experiments show IBISAgent consistently outperforms both closed-source and open-source state-of-the-art methods in medical referring and reasoning segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: IBISAgent successfully addresses limitations of existing approaches by enabling iterative refinement through agentic decision-making without architectural modifications, demonstrating superior performance in complex medical segmentation tasks while promoting pixel-level visual reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Recent research on medical MLLMs has gradually shifted its focus from image-level understanding to fine-grained, pixel-level comprehension. Although segmentation serves as the foundation for pixel-level understanding, existing approaches face two major challenges. First, they introduce implicit segmentation tokens and require simultaneous fine-tuning of both the MLLM and external pixel decoders, which increases the risk of catastrophic forgetting and limits generalization to out-of-domain scenarios. Second, most methods rely on single-pass reasoning and lack the capability to iteratively refine segmentation results, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel agentic MLLM, named IBISAgent, that reformulates segmentation as a vision-centric, multi-step decision-making process. IBISAgent enables MLLMs to generate interleaved reasoning and text-based click actions, invoke segmentation tools, and produce high-quality masks without architectural modifications. By iteratively performing multi-step visual reasoning on masked image features, IBISAgent naturally supports mask refinement and promotes the development of pixel-level visual reasoning capabilities. We further design a two-stage training framework consisting of cold-start supervised fine-tuning and agentic reinforcement learning with tailored, fine-grained rewards, enhancing the model's robustness in complex medical referring and reasoning segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IBISAgent consistently outperforms both closed-source and open-source SOTA methods. All datasets, code, and trained models will be released publicly.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CFSG model disentangles concept and feature spaces into common, specific, and confounding components for fine-grained domain generalization, achieving 9.87% improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained domain generalization is challenging due to subtle inter-class differences and pronounced intra-class variations. Models become overly sensitive to fine-grained cues under domain shifts, suppressing critical features. Humans use both common and specific attributes for fine-grained classification, but current deep learning models lack this mechanism.

Method: Propose Concept-Feature Structuralized Generalization (CFSG) that explicitly disentangles both concept and feature spaces into three structured components: common, specific, and confounding segments. Includes adaptive mechanism to dynamically adjust component proportions based on distribution shifts, and assigns explicit weights to each component pair in final prediction.

Result: Extensive experiments on three single-source benchmark datasets show CFSG achieves average 9.87% improvement over baseline models and outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by average 3.08%. Explainability analysis validates effective integration of multi-granularity structured knowledge and confirms feature structuralization facilitates concept structuralization emergence.

Conclusion: CFSG successfully addresses fine-grained domain generalization challenges by mimicking human cognitive mechanisms of using both common and specific attributes, with structural disentanglement and adaptive adjustment leading to significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Fine-Grained Domain Generalization (FGDG) presents greater challenges than conventional domain generalization due to the subtle inter-class differences and relatively pronounced intra-class variations inherent in fine-grained recognition tasks. Under domain shifts, the model becomes overly sensitive to fine-grained cues, leading to the suppression of critical features and a significant drop in performance. Cognitive studies suggest that humans classify objects by leveraging both common and specific attributes, enabling accurate differentiation between fine-grained categories. However, current deep learning models have yet to incorporate this mechanism effectively. Inspired by this mechanism, we propose Concept-Feature Structuralized Generalization (CFSG). This model explicitly disentangles both the concept and feature spaces into three structured components: common, specific, and confounding segments. To mitigate the adverse effects of varying degrees of distribution shift, we introduce an adaptive mechanism that dynamically adjusts the proportions of common, specific, and confounding components. In the final prediction, explicit weights are assigned to each pair of components. Extensive experiments on three single-source benchmark datasets demonstrate that CFSG achieves an average performance improvement of 9.87% over baseline models and outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by an average of 3.08%. Additionally, explainability analysis validates that CFSG effectively integrates multi-granularity structured knowledge and confirms that feature structuralization facilitates the emergence of concept structuralization.

Method: A multi-agent LLM framework with three specialized agents: visual agent (processes visual cues), language agent (handles text), and critic agent (integrates both). They work collaboratively for structured reasoning by combining visual and narrative context.

Result: The framework was evaluated on two cartoon VQA datasets (Pororo and Simpsons), with experimental results providing detailed analysis of each agent's contribution to final predictions and insights into multi-agent behavior in cartoon VQA.

Conclusion: The multi-agent approach offers a deeper understanding of LLM-based multi-agent behavior in cartoon VQA and multimodal inference, addressing the specific challenges of stylised cartoon imagery through collaborative specialized agents.

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) for stylised cartoon imagery presents challenges, such as interpreting exaggerated visual abstraction and narrative-driven context, which are not adequately addressed by standard large language models (LLMs) trained on natural images. To investigate this issue, a multi-agent LLM framework is introduced, specifically designed for VQA tasks in cartoon imagery. The proposed architecture consists of three specialised agents: visual agent, language agent and critic agent, which work collaboratively to support structured reasoning by integrating visual cues and narrative context. The framework was systematically evaluated on two cartoon-based VQA datasets: Pororo and Simpsons. Experimental results provide a detailed analysis of how each agent contributes to the final prediction, offering a deeper understanding of LLM-based multi-agent behaviour in cartoon VQA and multimodal inference.

### [56] [Text-Guided Layer Fusion Mitigates Hallucination in Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03100)
*Chenchen Lin,Sanbao Su,Rachel Luo,Yuxiao Chen,Yan Wang,Marco Pavone,Fei Miao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TGIF introduces a lightweight, query-conditioned fusion module that dynamically combines features from multiple vision encoder layers to reduce hallucinations and improve visual grounding in MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs underutilize the rich hierarchy of visual features in vision encoders, relying on single late-layer features and suffering from visually ungrounded hallucinations. Existing multi-layer fusion methods are static and don't adapt to specific queries.

Method: TGIF (Text-Guided Inter-layer Fusion) treats vision encoder layers as depth-wise "experts" and predicts a prompt-dependent fusion of visual features. It follows direct external fusion principles, requires no vision-encoder updates, and adds minimal overhead.

Result: Integrated into LLaVA-1.5-7B, TGIF provides consistent improvements across hallucination, OCR, and VQA benchmarks, while preserving or improving performance on ScienceQA, GQA, and MMBench.

Conclusion: Query-conditioned, hierarchy-aware fusion is an effective approach to strengthen visual grounding and reduce hallucination in modern MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically rely on a single late-layer feature from a frozen vision encoder, leaving the encoder's rich hierarchy of visual cues under-utilized. MLLMs still suffer from visually ungrounded hallucinations, often relying on language priors rather than image evidence. While many prior mitigation strategies operate on the text side, they leave the visual representation unchanged and do not exploit the rich hierarchy of features encoded across vision layers. Existing multi-layer fusion methods partially address this limitation but remain static, applying the same layer mixture regardless of the query. In this work, we introduce TGIF (Text-Guided Inter-layer Fusion), a lightweight module that treats encoder layers as depth-wise "experts" and predicts a prompt-dependent fusion of visual features. TGIF follows the principle of direct external fusion, requires no vision-encoder updates, and adds minimal overhead. Integrated into LLaVA-1.5-7B, TGIF provides consistent improvements across hallucination, OCR, and VQA benchmarks, while preserving or improving performance on ScienceQA, GQA, and MMBench. These results suggest that query-conditioned, hierarchy-aware fusion is an effective way to strengthen visual grounding and reduce hallucination in modern MLLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully combines deep learning, adversarial robustness, and explainable AI for effective grape leaf disease classification, deployed as a practical web application for farmers.

Abstract: Plant disease diagnosis is essential to farmers' management choices because plant diseases frequently lower crop yield and product quality. For harvests to flourish and agricultural productivity to boost, grape leaf disease detection is important. The plant disease dataset contains grape leaf diseases total of 9,032 images of four classes, among them three classes are leaf diseases, and the other one is healthy leaves. After rigorous pre-processing dataset was split (70% training, 20% validation, 10% testing), and two pre-trained models were deployed: InceptionV3 and Xception. Xception shows a promising result of 96.23% accuracy, which is remarkable than InceptionV3. Adversarial Training is used for robustness, along with more transparency. Grad-CAM is integrated to confirm the leaf disease. Finally deployed a web application using Streamlit with a heatmap visualization and prediction with confidence level for robust grape leaf disease classification.

*Sashuai Zhou,Qiang Zhou,Jijin Hu,Hanqing Yang,Yue Cao,Junpeng Ma,Yinchao Ma,Jun Song,Tiezheng Ge,Cheng Yu,Bo Zheng,Zhou Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unified Thinker is a reasoning architecture that decouples planning from image generation to improve logic-intensive instruction following in generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models struggle with logic-intensive instruction following, creating a reasoning-execution gap. Closed-source systems show strong reasoning-driven image generation, highlighting a substantial gap to open-source models that needs to be addressed.

Method: Proposes Unified Thinker, a task-agnostic reasoning architecture with a dedicated Thinker module separate from the Generator. Uses a two-stage training: first builds structured planning interface, then applies reinforcement learning with pixel-level feedback to ground plans in visual correctness.

Result: Extensive experiments on text-to-image generation and image editing show Unified Thinker substantially improves image reasoning and generation quality.

Conclusion: Closing the reasoning-execution gap requires executable reasoning that decomposes high-level intents into grounded plans, not just better visual generators. Unified Thinker's modular architecture enables reasoning upgrades without retraining entire generative models.

Abstract: Despite impressive progress in high-fidelity image synthesis, generative models still struggle with logic-intensive instruction following, exposing a persistent reasoning--execution gap. Meanwhile, closed-source systems (e.g., Nano Banana) have demonstrated strong reasoning-driven image generation, highlighting a substantial gap to current open-source models. We argue that closing this gap requires not merely better visual generators, but executable reasoning: decomposing high-level intents into grounded, verifiable plans that directly steer the generative process. To this end, we propose Unified Thinker, a task-agnostic reasoning architecture for general image generation, designed as a unified planning core that can plug into diverse generators and workflows. Unified Thinker decouples a dedicated Thinker from the image Generator, enabling modular upgrades of reasoning without retraining the entire generative model. We further introduce a two-stage training paradigm: we first build a structured planning interface for the Thinker, then apply reinforcement learning to ground its policy in pixel-level feedback, encouraging plans that optimize visual correctness over textual plausibility. Extensive experiments on text-to-image generation and image editing show that Unified Thinker substantially improves image reasoning and generation quality.

Conclusion: LSP-DETR provides a precise, scalable, and efficient end-to-end solution for nuclei instance segmentation in computational pathology, eliminating the need for patch-based processing and handcrafted post-processing.

Abstract: Precise and scalable instance segmentation of cell nuclei is essential for computational pathology, yet gigapixel Whole-Slide Images pose major computational challenges. Existing approaches rely on patch-based processing and costly post-processing for instance separation, sacrificing context and efficiency. We introduce LSP-DETR (Local Star Polygon DEtection TRansformer), a fully end-to-end framework that uses a lightweight transformer with linear complexity to process substantially larger images without additional computational cost. Nuclei are represented as star-convex polygons, and a novel radial distance loss function allows the segmentation of overlapping nuclei to emerge naturally, without requiring explicit overlap annotations or handcrafted post-processing. Evaluations on PanNuke and MoNuSeg show strong generalization across tissues and state-of-the-art efficiency, with LSP-DETR being over five times faster than the next-fastest leading method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have computational overhead from multi-step inference, hindering real-world deployment. Combining multiple acceleration techniques is challenging, requiring automated solutions.

Method: Two main components: 1) DiffBench - comprehensive benchmark with 3-stage automated evaluation pipeline across diverse diffusion architectures, optimizations, and deployment scenarios. 2) DiffAgent - LLM agent with closed-loop workflow (planning, code generation, debugging components) refined by genetic algorithm using execution feedback.

Result: DiffBench provides thorough evaluation of generated codes. DiffAgent significantly outperforms existing LLMs in producing effective diffusion acceleration strategies.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the challenge of combining multiple acceleration techniques for diffusion models through automated LLM-driven code generation and evaluation.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image and video generation. However, their inherently multiple step inference process imposes substantial computational overhead, hindering real-world deployment. Accelerating diffusion models is therefore essential, yet determining how to combine multiple model acceleration techniques remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, we introduce a framework driven by large language models (LLMs) for automated acceleration code generation and evaluation. First, we present DiffBench, a comprehensive benchmark that implements a three stage automated evaluation pipeline across diverse diffusion architectures, optimization combinations and deployment scenarios. Second, we propose DiffAgent, an agent that generates optimal acceleration strategies and codes for arbitrary diffusion models. DiffAgent employs a closed-loop workflow in which a planning component and a debugging component iteratively refine the output of a code generation component, while a genetic algorithm extracts performance feedback from the execution environment to guide subsequent code refinements. We provide a detailed explanation of the DiffBench construction and the design principles underlying DiffAgent. Extensive experiments show that DiffBench offers a thorough evaluation of generated codes and that DiffAgent significantly outperforms existing LLMs in producing effective diffusion acceleration strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal medical LLMs struggle with spatial reasoning and anatomical understanding in chest X-ray interpretation, lacking true anatomical correspondence despite grounding techniques.

Method: Two-stage approach inspired by radiological workflow: 1) identifies anatomical structures and extracts features, 2) uses LLM for downstream tasks (phrase grounding, report generation, VQA, image understanding).

Result: Achieves superior anatomical reasoning with over 25% improvement on anatomy grounding, phrase grounding, grounded diagnosis, and grounded captioning tasks compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: AnatomiX demonstrates that explicit anatomical modeling significantly enhances chest X-ray interpretation capabilities, bridging the gap in anatomical understanding for medical multimodal LLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal medical large language models have shown impressive progress in chest X-ray interpretation but continue to face challenges in spatial reasoning and anatomical understanding. Although existing grounding techniques improve overall performance, they often fail to establish a true anatomical correspondence, resulting in incorrect anatomical understanding in the medical domain. To address this gap, we introduce AnatomiX, a multitask multimodal large language model explicitly designed for anatomically grounded chest X-ray interpretation. Inspired by the radiological workflow, AnatomiX adopts a two stage approach: first, it identifies anatomical structures and extracts their features, and then leverages a large language model to perform diverse downstream tasks such as phrase grounding, report generation, visual question answering, and image understanding. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that AnatomiX achieves superior anatomical reasoning and delivers over 25% improvement in performance on anatomy grounding, phrase grounding, grounded diagnosis and grounded captioning tasks compared to existing approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniCorn is a self-improvement framework that addresses the "Conduction Aphasia" problem in Unified Multimodal Models, where models understand multimodal inputs but struggle with faithful generation, by using self-play with three internal roles and cognitive pattern reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UMMs excel at cross-modal comprehension but have a significant gap in leveraging that knowledge for high-quality generation, which the authors formalize as "Conduction Aphasia" - the inability to translate understanding into faithful synthesis.

Method: UniCorn partitions a single UMM into three collaborative roles: Proposer, Solver, and Judge. It generates high-quality interactions via self-play and uses cognitive pattern reconstruction to distill latent understanding into explicit generative signals. The framework requires no external data or teacher supervision.

Result: Achieves comprehensive improvements across six general image generation benchmarks, with SOTA performance on TIIF (73.8), DPG (86.8), CompBench (88.5), and UniCycle benchmark. Also delivers substantial gains of +5.0 on WISE and +6.5 on OneIG.

Conclusion: UniCorn significantly enhances T2I generation while maintaining robust comprehension, demonstrating the scalability of fully self-supervised refinement for unified multimodal intelligence and effectively addresses the Conduction Aphasia problem.

Abstract: While Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have achieved remarkable success in cross-modal comprehension, a significant gap persists in their ability to leverage such internal knowledge for high-quality generation. We formalize this discrepancy as Conduction Aphasia, a phenomenon where models accurately interpret multimodal inputs but struggle to translate that understanding into faithful and controllable synthesis. To address this, we propose UniCorn, a simple yet elegant self-improvement framework that eliminates the need for external data or teacher supervision. By partitioning a single UMM into three collaborative roles: Proposer, Solver, and Judge, UniCorn generates high-quality interactions via self-play and employs cognitive pattern reconstruction to distill latent understanding into explicit generative signals. To validate the restoration of multimodal coherence, we introduce UniCycle, a cycle-consistency benchmark based on a Text to Image to Text reconstruction loop. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniCorn achieves comprehensive and substantial improvements over the base model across six general image generation benchmarks. Notably, it achieves SOTA performance on TIIF(73.8), DPG(86.8), CompBench(88.5), and UniCycle while further delivering substantial gains of +5.0 on WISE and +6.5 on OneIG. These results highlight that our method significantly enhances T2I generation while maintaining robust comprehension, demonstrating the scalability of fully self-supervised refinement for unified multimodal intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video diffusion models generate silent videos, missing the semantic, emotional, and atmospheric cues that audio provides, limiting the immersive experience of generated content.

Method: Uses an asymmetric dual-stream transformer architecture with 14B-parameter video stream and 5B-parameter audio stream, connected via bidirectional audio-video cross-attention with temporal positional embeddings and cross-modality AdaLN.

Conclusion: LTX-2 demonstrates that unified audiovisual generation is feasible with efficient architecture design, providing high-quality synchronized content generation while being open-source and computationally efficient.

Abstract: Recent text-to-video diffusion models can generate compelling video sequences, yet they remain silent -- missing the semantic, emotional, and atmospheric cues that audio provides. We introduce LTX-2, an open-source foundational model capable of generating high-quality, temporally synchronized audiovisual content in a unified manner. LTX-2 consists of an asymmetric dual-stream transformer with a 14B-parameter video stream and a 5B-parameter audio stream, coupled through bidirectional audio-video cross-attention layers with temporal positional embeddings and cross-modality AdaLN for shared timestep conditioning. This architecture enables efficient training and inference of a unified audiovisual model while allocating more capacity for video generation than audio generation. We employ a multilingual text encoder for broader prompt understanding and introduce a modality-aware classifier-free guidance (modality-CFG) mechanism for improved audiovisual alignment and controllability. Beyond generating speech, LTX-2 produces rich, coherent audio tracks that follow the characters, environment, style, and emotion of each scene -- complete with natural background and foley elements. In our evaluations, the model achieves state-of-the-art audiovisual quality and prompt adherence among open-source systems, while delivering results comparable to proprietary models at a fraction of their computational cost and inference time. All model weights and code are publicly released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A MultiMedia-Agent system is proposed to automate complex content creation by integrating multiple AI tools through agent-based orchestration, addressing current limitations of individual AIGC models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AIGC models are limited to individual components in specific scenarios and cannot handle end-to-end complex content creation tasks that require multimodal integration (video, audio, text). Real-world applications need systems that can orchestrate multiple tools to create comprehensive multimedia content.

Method: The system includes: 1) A data generation pipeline and tool library for content creation, 2) Skill acquisition theory for training data curation and agent training, 3) Two-stage correlation strategy for plan optimization (self-correlation and model preference correlation), 4) Three-stage training approach (base/success plan fine-tuning and preference optimization).

Result: Comparison results demonstrate that the proposed approaches are effective, and the MultiMedia-Agent can generate better multimedia content compared to novel models.

Conclusion: Agent-based systems can effectively orchestrate multiple AI tools to automate complex multimedia content creation, overcoming the limitations of individual AIGC models through systematic training and optimization strategies.

Abstract: With the advancement of AIGC (AI-generated content) technologies, an increasing number of generative models are revolutionizing fields such as video editing, music generation, and even film production. However, due to the limitations of current AIGC models, most models can only serve as individual components within specific application scenarios and are not capable of completing tasks end-to-end in real-world applications. In real-world applications, editing experts often work with a wide variety of images and video inputs, producing multimodal outputs -- a video typically includes audio, text, and other elements. This level of integration across multiple modalities is something current models are unable to achieve effectively. However, the rise of agent-based systems has made it possible to use AI tools to tackle complex content generation tasks. To deal with the complex scenarios, in this paper, we propose a MultiMedia-Agent designed to automate complex content creation. Our agent system includes a data generation pipeline, a tool library for content creation, and a set of metrics for evaluating preference alignment. Notably, we introduce the skill acquisition theory to model the training data curation and agent training. We designed a two-stage correlation strategy for plan optimization, including self-correlation and model preference correlation. Additionally, we utilized the generated plans to train the MultiMedia-Agent via a three stage approach including base/success plan finetune and preference optimization. The comparison results demonstrate that the our approaches are effective and the MultiMedia-Agent can generate better multimedia content compared to novel models.

Conclusion: InfiniDepth's neural implicit field representation enables arbitrary-resolution depth estimation with superior geometric detail recovery, outperforming existing methods and benefiting downstream tasks like novel view synthesis.

Abstract: Existing depth estimation methods are fundamentally limited to predicting depth on discrete image grids. Such representations restrict their scalability to arbitrary output resolutions and hinder the geometric detail recovery. This paper introduces InfiniDepth, which represents depth as neural implicit fields. Through a simple yet effective local implicit decoder, we can query depth at continuous 2D coordinates, enabling arbitrary-resolution and fine-grained depth estimation. To better assess our method's capabilities, we curate a high-quality 4K synthetic benchmark from five different games, spanning diverse scenes with rich geometric and appearance details.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Muses is a training-free method for generating realistic 3D creatures using skeletal guidance, bypassing optimization or manual assembly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods for 3D creature generation rely on part-aware optimization, manual assembly, or 2D image generation, often producing unrealistic or incoherent results due to challenges with intricate part manipulation and limited out-of-domain generation.

Method: Muses uses 3D skeletons as fundamental biological representation to guide generation. It has a three-stage pipeline: 1) Graph-constrained reasoning to create coherent 3D skeletons, 2) Voxel-based assembly in structured latent space guided by skeletons, 3) Image-guided appearance modeling under skeletal conditions for consistent textures.

Result: Extensive experiments show Muses achieves state-of-the-art performance in visual fidelity and alignment with textual descriptions, with potential for flexible 3D object editing.

Conclusion: Muses presents a novel training-free approach for 3D creature generation that leverages skeletal guidance to overcome limitations of previous methods, enabling realistic and coherent 3D asset creation.

Abstract: We present Muses, the first training-free method for fantastic 3D creature generation in a feed-forward paradigm. Previous methods, which rely on part-aware optimization, manual assembly, or 2D image generation, often produce unrealistic or incoherent 3D assets due to the challenges of intricate part-level manipulation and limited out-of-domain generation. In contrast, Muses leverages the 3D skeleton, a fundamental representation of biological forms, to explicitly and rationally compose diverse elements. This skeletal foundation formalizes 3D content creation as a structure-aware pipeline of design, composition, and generation. Muses begins by constructing a creatively composed 3D skeleton with coherent layout and scale through graph-constrained reasoning. This skeleton then guides a voxel-based assembly process within a structured latent space, integrating regions from different objects. Finally, image-guided appearance modeling under skeletal conditions is applied to generate a style-consistent and harmonious texture for the assembled shape. Extensive experiments establish Muses' state-of-the-art performance in terms of visual fidelity and alignment with textual descriptions, and potential on flexible 3D object editing.

TL;DR: A physical transformer architecture that integrates transformer computation with geometric representations and physical dynamics across micro, meso, and macro levels, showing improved stability and accuracy on dynamical systems tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems operate primarily in virtual/symbolic domains without physical grounding. The authors aim to bridge this gap by creating AI models that incorporate physical dynamics and geometric structure for more interpretable and physically-grounded reasoning.

Method: Three-level hierarchical architecture: 1) Micro: attention heads as interacting spins with Hamiltonian dynamics, 2) Meso: aggregated state evolves on Neural Differential Manifold under Hamiltonian flows and HJB optimal control with symplectic discretization, 3) Macro: generative semantic workspace with 2D information-phase portrait for uncertainty tracking.

Result: On numerical integration and dynamical systems toy problems, the physical transformer outperforms naive baselines in stability and long-horizon accuracy, demonstrating benefits of respecting geometric and Hamiltonian structure.

Conclusion: The framework provides a path toward physically-grounded AI that unifies digital reasoning with physical manifolds, potentially leading to more interpretable and unified models for reasoning, control, and real-world interaction.

Abstract: Digital AI systems spanning large language models, vision models, and generative architectures that operate primarily in symbolic, linguistic, or pixel domains. They have achieved striking progress, but almost all of this progress lives in virtual spaces. These systems transform embeddings and tokens, yet do not themselves touch the world and rarely admit a physical interpretation. In this work we propose a physical transformer that couples modern transformer style computation with geometric representation and physical dynamics. At the micro level, attention heads, and feed-forward blocks are modeled as interacting spins governed by effective Hamiltonians plus non-Hamiltonian bath terms. At the meso level, their aggregated state evolves on a learned Neural Differential Manifold (NDM) under Hamiltonian flows and Hamilton, Jacobi, Bellman (HJB) optimal control, discretized by symplectic layers that approximately preserve geometric and energetic invariants. At the macro level, the model maintains a generative semantic workspace and a two-dimensional information-phase portrait that tracks uncertainty and information gain over a reasoning trajectory. Within this hierarchy, reasoning tasks are formulated as controlled information flows on the manifold, with solutions corresponding to low cost trajectories that satisfy geometric, energetic, and workspace-consistency constraints. On simple toy problems involving numerical integration and dynamical systems, the physical transformer outperforms naive baselines in stability and long-horizon accuracy, highlighting the benefits of respecting underlying geometric and Hamiltonian structure. More broadly, the framework suggests a path toward physical AI that unify digital reasoning with physically grounded manifolds, opening a route to more interpretable and potentially unified models of reasoning, control, and interaction with the real world.

Method: 1) Created WebGym with 300K tasks across diverse real websites with rubric-based evaluations. 2) Used RL training on agent interaction traces with task rewards. 3) Developed high-throughput asynchronous rollout system for 4-5x speedup. 4) Scaled task set breadth, depth, and size. 5) Fine-tuned Qwen-3-VL-8B-Instruct model.

Result: Fine-tuned model achieved 42.9% success rate on out-of-distribution test set (unseen websites), outperforming GPT-4o (27.1%) and GPT-5-Thinking (29.8%). The test set improvement from 26.2% to 42.9% is substantial as it uses completely unseen websites.

Conclusion: WebGym enables effective training of visual web agents through large-scale real-world environments and RL scaling, achieving state-of-the-art performance on challenging out-of-distribution tasks.

Abstract: We present WebGym, the largest-to-date open-source environment for training realistic visual web agents. Real websites are non-stationary and diverse, making artificial or small-scale task sets insufficient for robust policy learning. WebGym contains nearly 300,000 tasks with rubric-based evaluations across diverse, real-world websites and difficulty levels. We train agents with a simple reinforcement learning (RL) recipe, which trains on the agent's own interaction traces (rollouts), using task rewards as feedback to guide learning. To enable scaling RL, we speed up sampling of trajectories in WebGym by developing a high-throughput asynchronous rollout system, designed specifically for web agents. Our system achieves a 4-5x rollout speedup compared to naive implementations. Second, we scale the task set breadth, depth, and size, which results in continued performance improvement. Fine-tuning a strong base vision-language model, Qwen-3-VL-8B-Instruct, on WebGym results in an improvement in success rate on an out-of-distribution test set from 26.2% to 42.9%, significantly outperforming agents based on proprietary models such as GPT-4o and GPT-5-Thinking that achieve 27.1% and 29.8%, respectively. This improvement is substantial because our test set consists only of tasks on websites never seen during training, unlike many other prior works on training visual web agents.

*Subhankar Mishra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: mHC-GNN adapts manifold-constrained hyper-connections to GNNs, achieving exponentially slower over-smoothing and enhanced expressiveness beyond 1-WL test, maintaining strong performance even at 128 layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs face two key limitations: over-smoothing in deep architectures and expressiveness bounded by the 1-Weisfeiler-Leman test, which restricts their ability to distinguish certain graph structures.

Method: Adapts Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections to GNNs by expanding node representations across n parallel streams and constraining stream-mixing matrices to the Birkhoff polytope via Sinkhorn-Knopp normalization.

Result: mHC-GNN shows exponentially slower over-smoothing (rate (1-γ)^{L/n} vs. (1-γ)^L), distinguishes graphs beyond 1-WL, maintains over 74% accuracy at 128 layers while standard GNNs collapse beyond 16 layers, with improvements exceeding 50 percentage points at extreme depths.

Conclusion: The manifold constraint is essential for deep GNN performance, enabling stable training of very deep architectures while significantly mitigating over-smoothing and enhancing expressiveness beyond traditional GNN limitations.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) suffer from over-smoothing in deep architectures and expressiveness bounded by the 1-Weisfeiler-Leman (1-WL) test. We adapt Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (\mhc)~\citep{xie2025mhc}, recently proposed for Transformers, to graph neural networks. Our method, mHC-GNN, expands node representations across $n$ parallel streams and constrains stream-mixing matrices to the Birkhoff polytope via Sinkhorn-Knopp normalization. We prove that mHC-GNN exhibits exponentially slower over-smoothing (rate $(1-γ)^{L/n}$ vs.\ $(1-γ)^L$) and can distinguish graphs beyond 1-WL. Experiments on 10 datasets with 4 GNN architectures show consistent improvements. Depth experiments from 2 to 128 layers reveal that standard GNNs collapse to near-random performance beyond 16 layers, while mHC-GNN maintains over 74\% accuracy even at 128 layers, with improvements exceeding 50 percentage points at extreme depths. Ablations confirm that the manifold constraint is essential: removing it causes up to 82\% performance degradation.

### [70] [Polynomial Convergence of Riemannian Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02499)
*Xingyu Xu,Ziyi Zhang,Yorie Nakahira,Guannan Qu,Yuejie Chi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper strengthens theoretical guarantees for Riemannian diffusion models, showing that polynomially small step sizes suffice for small sampling error under L2-accurate score estimates, without requiring smoothness or positivity of the data distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models are state-of-the-art generative models, but most existing theory assumes Euclidean space. In practice, data often lies on submanifolds of Euclidean space. Previous work by De Bortoli et al. (2022) introduced Riemannian diffusion models but required exponentially small step sizes and strong assumptions about data distribution smoothness and positivity.

Method: The authors analyze Riemannian diffusion models using Li-Yau estimates for the log-gradient of heat kernel and Minakshisundaram-Pleijel parametrix expansion of the perturbed heat equation. They establish theoretical guarantees under mild curvature assumptions on the underlying manifold.

Result: The paper shows that polynomially small step sizes (rather than exponentially small) suffice to guarantee small sampling error in total variation distance, requiring only L2-accurate score estimates and standard curvature assumptions, without needing smoothness or positivity of the data distribution.

Conclusion: This work significantly strengthens the theoretical foundation for diffusion models on non-Euclidean spaces, opening the door to sharper analysis of diffusion models on manifolds and providing more practical theoretical guarantees for real-world applications where data lies on constrained spaces.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable empirical success in the recent years and are considered one of the state-of-the-art generative models in modern AI. These models consist of a forward process, which gradually diffuses the data distribution to a noise distribution spanning the whole space, and a backward process, which inverts this transformation to recover the data distribution from noise. Most of the existing literature assumes that the underlying space is Euclidean. However, in many practical applications, the data are constrained to lie on a submanifold of Euclidean space. Addressing this setting, De Bortoli et al. (2022) introduced Riemannian diffusion models and proved that using an exponentially small step size yields a small sampling error in the Wasserstein distance, provided the data distribution is smooth and strictly positive, and the score estimate is $L_\infty$-accurate. In this paper, we greatly strengthen this theory by establishing that, under $L_2$-accurate score estimate, a {\em polynomially small stepsize} suffices to guarantee small sampling error in the total variation distance, without requiring smoothness or positivity of the data distribution. Our analysis only requires mild and standard curvature assumptions on the underlying manifold. The main ingredients in our analysis are Li-Yau estimate for the log-gradient of heat kernel, and Minakshisundaram-Pleijel parametrix expansion of the perturbed heat equation. Our approach opens the door to a sharper analysis of diffusion models on non-Euclidean spaces.

TL;DR: I-GEM applies Gradient Episodic Memory constraints to LoRA adapters for efficient continual learning in LLMs, achieving similar accuracy to GEM with 1000x faster projection time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full fine-tuning of LLMs is computationally expensive, creating need for parameter-efficient continual learning approaches that can handle domain drift while maintaining performance.

Method: I-GEM revisits Gradient Episodic Memory (GEM) within Low-Rank Adapter (LoRA) subspace, using fixed-budget GPU-resident dual projected-gradient approximation to GEM's quadratic projection, constraining non-interference only within adapter parameters.

Result: On 3-task AG News split with domain drift using GPT-2 (355M) and LoRA (r=8), I-GEM matches GEM's average accuracy (within ~0.04 points), outperforms A-GEM by ~1.4 points, and reduces projection time vs GEM by factor of ~1000.

Conclusion: Applying GEM constraints in LoRA subspace provides practical pathway for continual learning at LLM scale with orders-of-magnitude lower computational overhead while maintaining stability.

Abstract: Full fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is computationally costly, motivating Continual Learning (CL) approaches that utilize parameter-efficient adapters. We revisit Gradient Episodic Memory (GEM) within the Low-Rank Adapter (LoRA) subspace and introduce I-GEM: a fixed-budget, GPU-resident dual projected-gradient approximation to GEM's quadratic projection. By constraining non-interference solely within the adapter parameters, I-GEM preserves GEM-like stability with orders-of-magnitude lower mean projection overhead. On a 3-task AG News split with induced domain drift, using GPT-2 (355M) and LoRA ($r=8$), I-GEM matches GEM's average accuracy (within $\sim\!0.04$ pts) and outperforms A-GEM by $\sim\!1.4$ pts. Crucially, it reduces projection time vs.\ GEM by a factor of $\sim\!10^3$. These results suggest that applying GEM constraints in the LoRA subspace is a practical pathway for continual learning at the LLM scale.

Furthermore, we propose the first implementation ever of Quantum Hyperdimensional Computing with quantum-powered arithmetic operations and a new Quantum Machine Learning model for supervised learning. hdlib remains open-source and available on GitHub at https://github.com/cumbof/hdlib under the MIT license, and distributed through the Python Package Index (pip install hdlib) and Conda (conda install -c conda-forge hdlib).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series anomaly detection faces challenges with sparse labels, complex temporal patterns, and costly expert annotation, requiring robust solutions for real-world applications in finance, healthcare, sensor networks, and industrial monitoring.

Method: Integrates LLM-based potential functions for reward shaping with RL, VAE-enhanced dynamic reward scaling, and active learning with label propagation. Uses LSTM-based RL agent with LLM-derived semantic rewards, VAE reconstruction errors for unsupervised signals, active learning for uncertain sample selection, and label propagation for expanding labeled data.

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in time series data is crucial for finance, healthcare, sensor networks, and industrial monitoring applications. However, time series anomaly detection often suffers from sparse labels, complex temporal patterns, and costly expert annotation. We propose a unified framework that integrates Large Language Model (LLM)-based potential functions for reward shaping with Reinforcement Learning (RL), Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-enhanced dynamic reward scaling, and active learning with label propagation. An LSTM-based RL agent leverages LLM-derived semantic rewards to guide exploration, while VAE reconstruction errors add unsupervised anomaly signals. Active learning selects the most uncertain samples, and label propagation efficiently expands labeled data. Evaluations on Yahoo-A1 and SMD benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy under limited labeling budgets and operates effectively in data-constrained settings. This study highlights the promise of combining LLMs with RL and advanced unsupervised techniques for robust, scalable anomaly detection in real-world applications.

*Zhuoyang Jiang,Yaosen Min,Peiran Jin,Lei Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CamS is a graph-to-sequence representation that enables decoder-only Transformers to learn molecular graphs via next-token prediction, achieving SOTA performance on molecular property prediction benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SMILES-based next-token prediction scales well but lacks explicit topology, while graph-native masked modeling captures connectivity but risks disrupting important chemical details like activity cliffs. There's a need to bridge this gap for better molecular property prediction.

Method: CamS serializes molecular graphs into structure-rich causal sequences by: 1) mining data-driven connection-aware motifs, 2) serializing motifs via scaffold-rooted BFS to establish core-to-periphery order, and 3) enabling hierarchical modeling by concatenating sequences from fine to coarse motif scales. This allows conditioning global scaffolds on dense local structural evidence.

Result: CamS-LLaMA (pre-trained vanilla LLaMA backbone on CamS sequences) achieves state-of-the-art performance on MoleculeNet and the activity-cliff benchmark MoleculeACE, outperforming both SMILES-based language models and strong graph baselines.

Conclusion: CamS effectively bridges the gap between SMILES-based and graph-native approaches, enabling decoder-only Transformers to learn molecular graphs via standard next-token prediction while preserving important chemical details. The multi-scale causal serialization drives attention toward cliff-determining differences, as confirmed by interpretability analysis.

Abstract: We present Connection-Aware Motif Sequencing (CamS), a graph-to-sequence representation that enables decoder-only Transformers to learn molecular graphs via standard next-token prediction (NTP). For molecular property prediction, SMILES-based NTP scales well but lacks explicit topology, whereas graph-native masked modeling captures connectivity but risks disrupting the pivotal chemical details (e.g., activity cliffs). CamS bridges this gap by serializing molecular graphs into structure-rich causal sequences. CamS first mines data-driven connection-aware motifs. It then serializes motifs via scaffold-rooted breadth-first search (BFS) to establish a stable core-to-periphery order. Crucially, CamS enables hierarchical modeling by concatenating sequences from fine to coarse motif scales, allowing the model to condition global scaffolds on dense, uncorrupted local structural evidence. We instantiate CamS-LLaMA by pre-training a vanilla LLaMA backbone on CamS sequences. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on MoleculeNet and the activity-cliff benchmark MoleculeACE, outperforming both SMILES-based language models and strong graph baselines. Interpretability analysis confirms that our multi-scale causal serialization effectively drives attention toward cliff-determining differences.

*Rohit Kaushik,Eva Kaushik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CBDC combines statistical learning theory, topological data analysis, and Bayesian conformal inference to provide dermatological classifiers with theoretical guarantees for generalization, stability, and uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dermatological imaging and mobile diagnostic tools need systems with strong theoretical guarantees, not just empirical performance. Current deep learning models lack well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, making them unreliable for clinical deployment.

Method: Conformal Bayesian Dermatological Classifier (CBDC) framework integrates Statistical Learning Theory, Topological Data Analysis (TDA), and Bayesian Conformal Inference to provide distribution-dependent generalization bounds, topological stability guarantees, and finite conformal coverage guarantees.

Result: CBDC achieves classification accuracy while generating calibrated, interpretable predictions on HAM10000, PH2, and ISIC 2020 datasets. It provides theoretical guarantees for generalization, stability under perturbations, and trustworthy uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: CBDC represents a theoretical and practical advancement for deep dermatological diagnostics, bridging the gap between machine learning theory and clinical applicability with provable guarantees.

Abstract: The rapid growth of dermatological imaging and mobile diagnostic tools calls for systems that not only demonstrate empirical performance but also provide strong theoretical guarantees. Deep learning models have shown high predictive accuracy; however, they are often criticized for lacking well, calibrated uncertainty estimates without which these models are hardly deployable in a clinical setting. To this end, we present the Conformal Bayesian Dermatological Classifier (CBDC), a well, founded framework that combines Statistical Learning Theory, Topological Data Analysis (TDA), and Bayesian Conformal Inference. CBDC offers distribution, dependent generalization bounds that reflect dermatological variability, proves a topological stability theorem that guarantees the invariance of convolutional neural network embeddings under photometric and morphological perturbations and provides finite conformal coverage guarantees for trustworthy uncertainty quantification.
  Through exhaustive experiments on the HAM10000, PH2, and ISIC 2020 datasets, we show that CBDC not only attains classification accuracy but also generates calibrated predictions that are interpretable from a clinical perspective. This research constitutes a theoretical and practical leap for deep dermatological diagnostics, thereby opening the machine learning theory clinical applicability interface.

### [76] [Normalized Conditional Mutual Information Surrogate Loss for Deep Neural Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02543)
*Linfeng Ye,Zhixiang Chi,Konstantinos N. Plataniotis,En-hui Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Normalized Conditional Mutual Information (NCMI) as a novel information-theoretic loss function that outperforms cross-entropy for training deep neural network classifiers, achieving significant accuracy improvements on ImageNet and medical imaging benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-entropy (CE) is the de facto standard loss for training DNN classifiers, but there may be better alternatives. The authors aim to develop a more effective loss function based on information theory that can improve classification performance across various domains.

Method: Propose Normalized Conditional Mutual Information (NCMI) as a surrogate loss function. The key insight is that NCMI is inversely proportional to model accuracy. Develop an alternating algorithm to efficiently minimize NCMI during training.

Result: NCMI-trained models substantially outperform state-of-the-art losses: 2.77% top-1 accuracy improvement on ImageNet with ResNet-50, 8.6% macro-F1 improvement on CAMELYON-17 medical imaging benchmark. Gains are consistent across various architectures and batch sizes.

Conclusion: NCMI is a practical and competitive alternative to cross-entropy for training DNN classifiers, offering significant performance improvements with comparable computational cost to CE.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel information theoretic surrogate loss; normalized conditional mutual information (NCMI); as a drop in alternative to the de facto cross-entropy (CE) for training deep neural network (DNN) based classifiers. We first observe that the model's NCMI is inversely proportional to its accuracy. Building on this insight, we introduce an alternating algorithm to efficiently minimize the NCMI. Across image recognition and whole-slide imaging (WSI) subtyping benchmarks, NCMI-trained models surpass state of the art losses by substantial margins at a computational cost comparable to that of CE. Notably, on ImageNet, NCMI yields a 2.77% top-1 accuracy improvement with ResNet-50 comparing to the CE; on CAMELYON-17, replacing CE with NCMI improves the macro-F1 by 8.6% over the strongest baseline. Gains are consistent across various architectures and batch sizes, suggesting that NCMI is a practical and competitive alternative to CE.

*Javier Salazar Cavazos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PET-TURTLE improves TURTLE clustering by handling imbalanced data with power law prior and sparse logits, enhancing accuracy for both balanced and imbalanced datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TURTLE clustering algorithm assumes balanced clusters, which fails on imbalanced data distributions, leading to non-ideal hyperplanes and higher clustering error.

Method: PET-TURTLE generalizes TURTLE's cost function with a power law prior to handle imbalanced data, and introduces sparse logits in labeling to simplify the search space.

Result: Experiments show PET-TURTLE improves accuracy for imbalanced data, prevents over-prediction of minority clusters, and enhances overall clustering performance.

Conclusion: PET-TURTLE successfully addresses TURTLE's limitation with imbalanced data while maintaining or improving performance on balanced datasets through power law prior and sparse logits.

Abstract: Foundation vision, audio, and language models enable zero-shot performance on downstream tasks via their latent representations. Recently, unsupervised learning of data group structure with deep learning methods has gained popularity. TURTLE, a state of the art deep clustering algorithm, uncovers data labeling without supervision by alternating label and hyperplane updates, maximizing the hyperplane margin, in a similar fashion to support vector machines (SVMs). However, TURTLE assumes clusters are balanced; when data is imbalanced, it yields non-ideal hyperplanes that cause higher clustering error. We propose PET-TURTLE, which generalizes the cost function to handle imbalanced data distributions by a power law prior. Additionally, by introducing sparse logits in the labeling process, PET-TURTLE optimizes a simpler search space that in turn improves accuracy for balanced datasets. Experiments on synthetic and real data show that PET-TURTLE improves accuracy for imbalanced sources, prevents over-prediction of minority clusters, and enhances overall clustering.

TL;DR: RadioDiff-Flux: A two-stage latent diffusion framework for fast radio map generation in 6G networks, achieving 50× acceleration with minimal accuracy loss by reusing precomputed midpoints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Future 6G networks with high-speed entities and fast-changing environments require real-time radio map construction, but current diffusion models have prohibitive inference latency due to their iterative nature.

Method: Two-stage latent diffusion framework: 1) Generates coarse latent representation using static scene features (cached and shared), 2) Adapts representation to dynamic conditions and transmitter locations using pre-trained model, bypassing redundant denoising.

Result: Achieves up to 50× acceleration with less than 0.15% accuracy loss compared to standard diffusion models, enabling practical fast radio map generation for 6G networks.

Conclusion: RadioDiff-Flux provides an efficient solution for scalable real-time radio map construction in dynamic 6G environments by leveraging latent midpoint consistency across similar scenes.

Abstract: Accurate radio map (RM) construction is essential to enabling environment-aware and adaptive wireless communication. However, in future 6G scenarios characterized by high-speed network entities and fast-changing environments, it is very challenging to meet real-time requirements. Although generative diffusion models (DMs) can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with second-level delay, their iterative nature leads to prohibitive inference latency in delay-sensitive scenarios. In this paper, by uncovering a key structural property of diffusion processes: the latent midpoints remain highly consistent across semantically similar scenes, we propose RadioDiff-Flux, a novel two-stage latent diffusion framework that decouples static environmental modeling from dynamic refinement, enabling the reuse of precomputed midpoints to bypass redundant denoising. In particular, the first stage generates a coarse latent representation using only static scene features, which can be cached and shared across similar scenarios. The second stage adapts this representation to dynamic conditions and transmitter locations using a pre-trained model, thereby avoiding repeated early-stage computation. The proposed RadioDiff-Flux significantly reduces inference time while preserving fidelity. Experiment results show that RadioDiff-Flux can achieve up to 50 acceleration with less than 0.15% accuracy loss, demonstrating its practical utility for fast, scalable RM generation in future 6G networks.

TL;DR: QNTK-UCB algorithm uses frozen quantum neural tangent kernel for contextual bandits, achieving better scaling than classical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural network-based contextual bandit algorithms struggle with quantum neural networks due to over-parameterization, computational instability, and barren plateaus. Need quantum algorithms that can scale effectively.

Method: Freeze QNN at random initialization, use its static Quantum Neural Tangent Kernel (QNTK) as kernel for ridge regression in UCB algorithm, bypassing unstable training dynamics while exploiting quantum inductive bias.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows improved parameter scaling of Ω((TK)³) vs classical NeuralUCB's Ω((TK)⁸). Empirical evaluations demonstrate superior sample efficiency in low-data regimes on synthetic benchmarks and quantum-native tasks.

Conclusion: QNTK provides implicit regularization and sharper spectral decay, enabling quantum advantage in online learning by addressing key limitations of quantum neural networks in contextual bandits.

Abstract: Stochastic contextual bandits are fundamental for sequential decision-making but pose significant challenges for existing neural network-based algorithms, particularly when scaling to quantum neural networks (QNNs) due to issues such as massive over-parameterization, computational instability, and the barren plateau phenomenon. This paper introduces the Quantum Neural Tangent Kernel-Upper Confidence Bound (QNTK-UCB) algorithm, a novel algorithm that leverages the Quantum Neural Tangent Kernel (QNTK) to address these limitations.
  By freezing the QNN at a random initialization and utilizing its static QNTK as a kernel for ridge regression, QNTK-UCB bypasses the unstable training dynamics inherent in explicit parameterized quantum circuit training while fully exploiting the unique quantum inductive bias. For a time horizon $T$ and $K$ actions, our theoretical analysis reveals a significantly improved parameter scaling of $Ω((TK)^3)$ for QNTK-UCB, a substantial reduction compared to $Ω((TK)^8)$ required by classical NeuralUCB algorithms for similar regret guarantees. Empirical evaluations on non-linear synthetic benchmarks and quantum-native variational quantum eigensolver tasks demonstrate QNTK-UCB's superior sample efficiency in low-data regimes. This work highlights how the inherent properties of QNTK provide implicit regularization and a sharper spectral decay, paving the way for achieving ``quantum advantage'' in online learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning framework using artificial neural networks for detecting malicious behavior in social media networks based on network traffic analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social media platforms face increasing security threats including intrusion attempts, abnormal traffic patterns, and organized attacks. Traditional rule-based security systems are insufficiently scalable and dynamic to handle these evolving threats.

Method: Developed a threat detection framework using artificial neural networks (ANN) trained on network traffic data. Conducted extensive preprocessing and exploratory data analysis to address data imbalance, feature inconsistency, and noise issues.

Result: The ANN model demonstrated strong performance on standard metrics (accuracy, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC) with good detection capabilities and robustness, showing effectiveness in identifying malicious behavior patterns.

Conclusion: Neural network-based solutions show promise for detecting latent threats in large-scale social media networks and can complement existing intrusion detection systems to enable more proactive cybersecurity operations.

Abstract: The accelerated development of social media websites has posed intricate security issues in cyberspace, where these sites have increasingly become victims of criminal activities including attempts to intrude into them, abnormal traffic patterns, and organized attacks. The conventional rule-based security systems are not always scalable and dynamic to meet such a threat. This paper introduces a threat detection framework based on machine learning that can be used to classify malicious behavior in the social media network environment based on the nature of network traffic. Exploiting a rich network traffic dataset, the massive preprocessing and exploratory data analysis is conducted to overcome the problem of data imbalance, feature inconsistency, and noise. A model of artificial neural network (ANN) is then created to acquire intricate, non-linear tendencies of malicious actions. The proposed model is tested on conventional performance metrics, such as accuracy, accuracy, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, and shows good detection and high levels of strength. The findings suggest that neural network-based solutions have the potential to be used effectively to identify the latent threat dynamics within the context of a large-scale social media network and that they can be employed to complement the existing intrusion detection system and better to conduct proactive cybersecurity operations.

TL;DR: Chronicals is an open-source training framework that achieves 3.51x speedup over Unsloth for LLM fine-tuning through four memory and compute optimizations, addressing the memory bottleneck of large model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language model fine-tuning is severely bottlenecked by memory requirements - a 7B parameter model needs 84GB (exceeding A100-40GB capacity), with most memory consumed by optimizer states (56GB FP32). Current frameworks like Unsloth have limitations and even reported misleading benchmarks where models weren't actually training.

Method: Four synergistic optimizations: (1) Fused Triton kernels (RMSNorm 7x, SwiGLU 5x, QK-RoPE 2.3x fusion) eliminating 75% memory traffic; (2) Cut Cross-Entropy reducing logit memory from 5GB to 135MB via online softmax; (3) LoRA+ with theoretically-derived 16x differential learning rates between adapter matrices; (4) Best-Fit Decreasing sequence packing recovering 60-75% of wasted compute on padding.

Result: On Qwen2.5-0.5B with A100-40GB: 41,184 tokens/sec for full fine-tuning (3.51x over Unsloth's 11,736 tokens/sec). For LoRA at rank 32: 11,699 tokens/sec (4.10x over Unsloth MAX's 2,857 tokens/sec). Also discovered Unsloth's reported 46,000 tokens/sec benchmark had zero gradient norms (model wasn't training).

Conclusion: Chronicals provides significant speed improvements for LLM fine-tuning while addressing memory bottlenecks, with complete mathematical foundations and open-source implementation available. The framework enables more efficient training on limited hardware and exposes issues with previous benchmark claims.

Abstract: Large language model fine-tuning is bottlenecked by memory: a 7B parameter model requires 84GB--14GB for weights, 14GB for gradients, and 56GB for FP32 optimizer states--exceeding even A100-40GB capacity. We present Chronicals, an open-source training framework achieving 3.51x speedup over Unsloth through four synergistic optimizations: (1) fused Triton kernels eliminating 75% of memory traffic via RMSNorm (7x), SwiGLU (5x), and QK-RoPE (2.3x) fusion; (2) Cut Cross-Entropy reducing logit memory from 5GB to 135MB through online softmax computation; (3) LoRA+ with theoretically-derived 16x differential learning rates between adapter matrices; and (4) Best-Fit Decreasing sequence packing recovering 60-75% of compute wasted on padding.
  On Qwen2.5-0.5B with A100-40GB, Chronicals achieves 41,184 tokens/second for full fine-tuning versus Unsloth's 11,736 tokens/second (3.51x). For LoRA at rank 32, we reach 11,699 tokens/second versus Unsloth MAX's 2,857 tokens/second (4.10x). Critically, we discovered that Unsloth's reported 46,000 tokens/second benchmark exhibited zero gradient norms--the model was not training.
  We provide complete mathematical foundations: online softmax correctness proofs, FlashAttention IO complexity bounds O(N^2 d^2 M^{-1}), LoRA+ learning rate derivations from gradient magnitude analysis, and bin-packing approximation guarantees.

### [83] [Credit Assignment via Neural Manifold Noise Correlation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02636)
*Byungwoo Kang,Maceo Richards,Bernardo Sabatini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NMNC improves credit assignment by restricting noise perturbations to the neural manifold, outperforming vanilla noise correlation in efficiency and biological plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard noise correlation for credit assignment scales poorly with network size and uses isotropic noise that conflicts with biological observations of low-dimensional neural manifolds.

Method: Neural Manifold Noise Correlation (NMNC) performs credit assignment using perturbations restricted to the neural manifold, leveraging the alignment between Jacobian row space and neural manifold in trained networks.

Result: NMNC substantially improves performance and sample efficiency over vanilla noise correlation in convolutional networks (CIFAR-10, ImageNet-scale), recurrent networks, and yields representations more similar to primate visual system.

Conclusion: NMNC offers a mechanistic hypothesis for biological credit assignment and suggests that biologically inspired constraints may enable effective learning at scale rather than limit it.

Abstract: Credit assignment--how changes in individual neurons and synapses affect a network's output--is central to learning in brains and machines. Noise correlation, which estimates gradients by correlating perturbations of activity with changes in output, provides a biologically plausible solution to credit assignment but scales poorly as accurately estimating the Jacobian requires that the number of perturbations scale with network size. Moreover, isotropic noise conflicts with neurobiological observations that neural activity lies on a low-dimensional manifold. To address these drawbacks, we propose neural manifold noise correlation (NMNC), which performs credit assignment using perturbations restricted to the neural manifold. We show theoretically and empirically that the Jacobian row space aligns with the neural manifold in trained networks, and that manifold dimensionality scales slowly with network size. NMNC substantially improves performance and sample efficiency over vanilla noise correlation in convolutional networks trained on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-scale models, and recurrent networks. NMNC also yields representations more similar to the primate visual system than vanilla noise correlation. These findings offer a mechanistic hypothesis for how biological circuits could support credit assignment, and suggest that biologically inspired constraints may enable, rather than limit, effective learning at scale.

*Mehdi Fatemi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A problem-level prioritization framework for RL post-training of LLMs that automatically selects training problems based on empirical success rates, focusing on problems with intermediate difficulty to maximize learning signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve RL post-training efficiency by automatically prioritizing problems that provide the strongest learning signals, avoiding manual curriculum design and aligning with GRPO dynamics.

Method: Uses model-driven priority scores from empirical success statistics, heap-based prioritized sampling, and periodic retesting to prevent starvation/forgetting. No predefined difficulty tiers or external labels needed.

Result: Creates a continuously adapting automatic prioritization process that focuses training on problems with intermediate success rates (neither consistently solved nor failed).

Conclusion: Provides a principled, scalable alternative to manual curriculum design that directly aligns data selection with GRPO-based post-training dynamics.

Abstract: We introduce a problem-level prioritization framework for RL post-training of large language models. Building on insights from prioritized replay in deep RL, as well as prior observations that rollouts with intermediate success rates tend to produce stronger learning signals under methods such as GRPO, our approach selects problems according to a simple, model-driven priority score derived from empirical success statistics. In contrast to conventional curriculum strategies that emphasize easier tasks early in training, the resulting schedule naturally focuses training on problems that are neither consistently solved nor consistently failed, while deprioritizing those that contribute little gradient information. The method yields a continuously adapting and automatic prioritization process that requires no predefined difficulty tiers, auxiliary predictors, or external labels. We further introduce lightweight mechanisms for practical deployment, including heap-based prioritized sampling and periodic retesting of solved and unsolved problems to mitigate starvation and forgetting. Overall, the approach offers a principled and scalable alternative to manually designed curricula while aligning data selection directly with the dynamics of GRPO-based post-training.

### [85] [When Prompting Meets Spiking: Graph Sparse Prompting via Spiking Graph Prompt Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02662)
*Bo Jiang,Weijun Zhao,Beibei Wang,Jin Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Spiking Graph Prompt Feature (SpikingGPF) introduces sparse prompting for GNNs using spiking neurons to select relevant node features, improving robustness against noise and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Graph Prompt Features (GPFs) prompt all node feature dimensions, which is redundant and sensitive to feature noise. There's a need for more selective and robust prompting methods.

Method: SpikingGPF uses spiking neuron architecture to learn sparse prompt vectors that select only relevant node features, and employs sparse representation theory to represent prompts as sparse combinations of prompt atoms.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmarks show SpikingGPF is effective and robust, providing more compact prompting while improving noise resistance.

Conclusion: SpikingGPF successfully addresses redundancy and noise sensitivity in graph prompting through sparse prompting with spiking neurons, offering a more efficient and robust approach.

Abstract: Graph Prompt Feature (GPF) learning has been widely used in adapting pre-trained GNN model on the downstream task. GPFs first introduce some prompt atoms and then learns the optimal prompt vector for each graph node using the linear combination of prompt atoms. However, existing GPFs generally conduct prompting over node's all feature dimensions which is obviously redundant and also be sensitive to node feature noise. To overcome this issue, for the first time, this paper proposes learning sparse graph prompts by leveraging the spiking neuron mechanism, termed Spiking Graph Prompt Feature (SpikingGPF). Our approach is motivated by the observation that spiking neuron can perform inexpensive information processing and produce sparse outputs which naturally fits the task of our graph sparse prompting. Specifically, SpikingGPF has two main aspects. First, it learns a sparse prompt vector for each node by exploiting a spiking neuron architecture, enabling prompting on selective node features. This yields a more compact and lightweight prompting design while also improving robustness against node noise. Second, SpikingGPF introduces a novel prompt representation learning model based on sparse representation theory, i.e., it represents each node prompt as a sparse combination of prompt atoms. This encourages a more compact representation and also facilitates efficient computation. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SpikingGPF.

### [86] [MAFS: Multi-head Attention Feature Selection for High-Dimensional Data via Deep Fusion of Filter Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02668)
*Xiaoyan Sun,Qingyu Meng,Yalu Wen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAFS is a hybrid feature selection framework that combines statistical filter methods with multi-head attention deep learning to provide scalable, interpretable, and robust feature selection for high-dimensional biomedical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feature selection methods have limitations: filter methods can't capture complex relationships, deep learning lacks stability and interpretability, and single-head attention has limited dependency capture and reproducibility issues. There's a need to combine statistical interpretability with deep learning power, especially for ultra-high-dimensional biomedical data.

Method: MAFS integrates statistical priors with deep learning: 1) Starts with filter-based priors for stable initialization and guidance, 2) Uses multi-head attention to examine features from multiple perspectives in parallel, capturing complex nonlinear relationships and interactions, 3) Includes a reordering module to consolidate outputs across attention heads, resolving conflicts and minimizing information loss for robust feature rankings.

Result: MAFS consistently achieves superior coverage and stability compared to existing filter-based and deep learning-based alternatives across simulated and real-world datasets, including cancer gene expression and Alzheimer's disease data.

Conclusion: MAFS offers a scalable, interpretable, and robust solution for feature selection in high-dimensional biomedical data by combining statistical guidance with deep modeling capacity, yielding interpretable importance scores while maximizing retention of informative signals.

Abstract: Feature selection is essential for high-dimensional biomedical data, enabling stronger predictive performance, reduced computational cost, and improved interpretability in precision medicine applications. Existing approaches face notable challenges. Filter methods are highly scalable but cannot capture complex relationships or eliminate redundancy. Deep learning-based approaches can model nonlinear patterns but often lack stability, interpretability, and efficiency at scale. Single-head attention improves interpretability but is limited in capturing multi-level dependencies and remains sensitive to initialization, reducing reproducibility. Most existing methods rarely combine statistical interpretability with the representational power of deep learning, particularly in ultra-high-dimensional settings. Here, we introduce MAFS (Multi-head Attention-based Feature Selection), a hybrid framework that integrates statistical priors with deep learning capabilities. MAFS begins with filter-based priors for stable initialization and guide learning. It then uses multi-head attention to examine features from multiple perspectives in parallel, capturing complex nonlinear relationships and interactions. Finally, a reordering module consolidates outputs across attention heads, resolving conflicts and minimizing information loss to generate robust and consistent feature rankings. This design combines statistical guidance with deep modeling capacity, yielding interpretable importance scores while maximizing retention of informative signals. Across simulated and real-world datasets, including cancer gene expression and Alzheimer's disease data, MAFS consistently achieves superior coverage and stability compared with existing filter-based and deep learning-based alternatives, offering a scalable, interpretable, and robust solution for feature selection in high-dimensional biomedical data.

### [88] [Topology-Independent Robustness of the Weighted Mean under Label Poisoning Attacks in Heterogeneous Decentralized Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02682)
*Jie Peng,Weiyu Li,Stefan Vlaski,Qing Ling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Weighted mean aggregator can outperform robust aggregators in decentralized learning under label poisoning attacks when network topology conditions favor it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defense methods focus on robust aggregators while treating weighted mean as vulnerable, but this paper investigates when weighted mean might actually perform better under label poisoning attacks.

Method: Theoretical analysis of decentralized gradient descent under label poisoning attacks, comparing robust aggregators with weighted mean aggregator, considering network topology effects.

Result: Weighted mean aggregator's performance is topology-independent, while robust aggregators depend on network topology. Weighted mean can outperform robust aggregators when: (1) global contamination rate < local contamination rate, (2) regular agent network is disconnected, or (3) network is sparse with high local contamination.

Conclusion: Network topology plays crucial role in robustness to label poisoning; weighted mean aggregator, often considered vulnerable, can be superior under certain topological conditions, challenging conventional wisdom.

Abstract: Robustness to malicious attacks is crucial for practical decentralized signal processing and machine learning systems. A typical example of such attacks is label poisoning, meaning that some agents possess corrupted local labels and share models trained on these poisoned data. To defend against malicious attacks, existing works often focus on designing robust aggregators; meanwhile, the weighted mean aggregator is typically considered a simple, vulnerable baseline. This paper analyzes the robustness of decentralized gradient descent under label poisoning attacks, considering both robust and weighted mean aggregators. Theoretical results reveal that the learning errors of robust aggregators depend on the network topology, whereas the performance of weighted mean aggregator is topology-independent. Remarkably, the weighted mean aggregator, although often considered vulnerable, can outperform robust aggregators under sufficient heterogeneity, particularly when: (i) the global contamination rate (i.e., the fraction of poisoned agents for the entire network) is smaller than the local contamination rate (i.e., the maximal fraction of poisoned neighbors for the regular agents); (ii) the network of regular agents is disconnected; or (iii) the network of regular agents is sparse and the local contamination rate is high. Empirical results support our theoretical findings, highlighting the important role of network topology in the robustness to label poisoning attacks.

### [89] [Scaling Laws of Machine Learning for Optimal Power Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02706)
*Xinyi Liu,Xuan He,Yize Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents the first systematic scaling study for ML-based optimal power flow (OPF), quantifying power-law relationships between data/compute resources and performance metrics to enable predictable ML pipeline design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ML approaches for OPF lack systematic understanding of scaling relationships - specifically, what minimum training data is needed and how to balance model complexity with real-time computational limits. Current trial-and-error development methods are inefficient for real-world deployment.

Method: Conducted systematic scaling study across two dimensions: data scale (0.1K-40K training samples) and compute scale (multiple neural network architectures with varying FLOPs). Evaluated both DNNs and physics-informed NNs (PINNs) on ACOPF problems, measuring performance across three core metrics: prediction error (MAE), constraint violations, and speed.

Result: Revealed consistent power-law relationships between resource dimensions (data and compute) and performance metrics. Found that for ACOPF, accuracy scales with both dataset size and training compute. Identified divergence between prediction accuracy and constraint feasibility, and characterized the compute-optimal frontier.

Conclusion: The scaling laws enable predictable and principled ML pipeline design for OPF applications. This work provides quantitative guidance for ML-OPF design and deployments, moving beyond trial-and-error approaches to systematic resource-performance optimization.

Abstract: Optimal power flow (OPF) is one of the fundamental tasks for power system operations. While machine learning (ML) approaches such as deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely studied to enhance OPF solution speed and performance, their practical deployment faces two critical scaling questions: What is the minimum training data volume required for reliable results? How should ML models' complexity balance accuracy with real-time computational limits? Existing studies evaluate discrete scenarios without quantifying these scaling relationships, leading to trial-and-error-based ML development in real-world applications. This work presents the first systematic scaling study for ML-based OPF across two dimensions: data scale (0.1K-40K training samples) and compute scale (multiple NN architectures with varying FLOPs). Our results reveal consistent power-law relationships on both DNNs and physics-informed NNs (PINNs) between each resource dimension and three core performance metrics: prediction error (MAE), constraint violations and speed. We find that for ACOPF, the accuracy metric scales with dataset size and training compute. These scaling laws enable predictable and principled ML pipeline design for OPF. We further identify the divergence between prediction accuracy and constraint feasibility and characterize the compute-optimal frontier. This work provides quantitative guidance for ML-OPF design and deployments.

### [90] [CRoPE: Efficient Parametrization of Rotary Positional Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02728)
*Beicheng Lou,Zifei Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Rotary positional embedding (RoPE) implementations are not truly complex linear transformations; using actual complex linear algebra saves ~50% parameters in attention blocks with minimal performance impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RoPE implementations in transformers use Q/K/V projections that aren't equivalent to complex linear transformations, creating parameter redundancy. The authors argue complex linear transformation is more natural and parameter-efficient.

Method: Modify RoPE implementation to use actual complex linear transformations instead of the current non-equivalent Q/K/V projection approach, reducing parameter count in attention blocks.

Result: Achieves ~50% parameter reduction in attention blocks with negligible impact on model performance both in-sample and out-of-sample.

Conclusion: Complex linear transformation is a more natural parametrization for RoPE that provides efficient parameter usage and cleaner representation space interpretation without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Rotary positional embedding has become the state-of-the-art approach to encode position information in transformer-based models. While it is often succinctly expressed in complex linear algebra, we note that the actual implementation of $Q/K/V$-projections is not equivalent to a complex linear transformation. We argue that complex linear transformation is a more natural parametrization and saves near 50\% parameters within the attention block. We show empirically that removing such redundancy has negligible impact on the model performance both in sample and out of sample. Our modification achieves more efficient parameter usage, as well as a cleaner interpretation of the representation space.

TL;DR: A framework for efficient proximity computation in tree ensembles using separable weighted leaf-collision proximities that enables scalable sparse matrix factorization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tree ensemble methods like Random Forests create useful similarity measures, but existing proximity implementations suffer from quadratic time/memory complexity, limiting scalability to large datasets.

Method: Introduces Separable Weighted Leaf-Collision Proximities - a family of proximity measures that admit exact sparse matrix factorization. This restricts computation to leaf-level collisions only, avoiding explicit pairwise comparisons and enabling efficient sparse linear algebra implementation.

Result: Empirical benchmarks show substantial runtime and memory improvements over traditional approaches, allowing tree ensemble proximities to scale efficiently to datasets with hundreds of thousands of samples on standard CPU hardware.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables low-memory, scalable proximity computation for tree ensembles, overcoming previous quadratic complexity limitations and making these similarity measures practical for large-scale applications.

Abstract: Tree ensemble methods such as Random Forests naturally induce supervised similarity measures through their decision tree structure, but existing implementations of proximities derived from tree ensembles typically suffer from quadratic time or memory complexity, limiting their scalability. In this work, we introduce a general framework for efficient proximity computation by defining a family of Separable Weighted Leaf-Collision Proximities. We show that any proximity measure in this family admits an exact sparse matrix factorization, restricting computation to leaf-level collisions and avoiding explicit pairwise comparisons. This formulation enables low-memory, scalable proximity computation using sparse linear algebra in Python. Empirical benchmarks demonstrate substantial runtime and memory improvements over traditional approaches, allowing tree ensemble proximities to scale efficiently to datasets with hundreds of thousands of samples on standard CPU hardware.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QGA is a Q-value regularized generative auto-bidding method that combines Decision Transformer with double Q-learning to optimize both policy imitation and action-value maximization, achieving superior performance in e-commerce advertising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current auto-bidding approaches using RL and generative models have limitations: they imitate offline historical behaviors with complex structures requiring expensive hyperparameter tuning, and suboptimal trajectories in datasets make policy learning difficult.

Method: QGA integrates Q-value regularization with double Q-learning into Decision Transformer backbone for joint optimization of policy imitation and action-value maximization. It also includes a Q-value guided dual-exploration mechanism with multiple return-to-go targets and locally perturbed actions, dynamically guided by Q-value evaluation.

Result: Experiments show QGA consistently achieves superior or highly competitive results on public benchmarks and simulation environments. In large-scale real-world A/B testing, it achieves 3.27% increase in Ad GMV and 2.49% improvement in Ad ROI.

Conclusion: QGA effectively addresses limitations of existing auto-bidding methods by combining generative modeling with value-based reinforcement learning, enabling better utilization of dataset experience while mitigating negative impacts of suboptimal trajectories through principled exploration.

Abstract: With the rapid development of e-commerce, auto-bidding has become a key asset in optimizing advertising performance under diverse advertiser environments. The current approaches focus on reinforcement learning (RL) and generative models. These efforts imitate offline historical behaviors by utilizing a complex structure with expensive hyperparameter tuning. The suboptimal trajectories further exacerbate the difficulty of policy learning.
  To address these challenges, we proposes QGA, a novel Q-value regularized Generative Auto-bidding method. In QGA, we propose to plug a Q-value regularization with double Q-learning strategy into the Decision Transformer backbone. This design enables joint optimization of policy imitation and action-value maximization, allowing the learned bidding policy to both leverage experience from the dataset and alleviate the adverse impact of the suboptimal trajectories. Furthermore, to safely explore the policy space beyond the data distribution, we propose a Q-value guided dual-exploration mechanism, in which the DT model is conditioned on multiple return-to-go targets and locally perturbed actions. This entire exploration process is dynamically guided by the aforementioned Q-value module, which provides principled evaluation for each candidate action. Experiments on public benchmarks and simulation environments demonstrate that QGA consistently achieves superior or highly competitive results compared to existing alternatives. Notably, in large-scale real-world A/B testing, QGA achieves a 3.27% increase in Ad GMV and a 2.49% improvement in Ad ROI.

### [93] [Stratified Hazard Sampling: Minimal-Variance Event Scheduling for CTMC/DTMC Discrete Diffusion and Flow Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02799)
*Seunghwan Jang,SooJean Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Stratified Hazard Sampling (SHS), a drop-in inference method for discrete generative models that reduces variance in token editing by stratifying cumulative hazard, improving reproducibility and reducing failure modes like under/over-editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CTMC/DTMC-based discrete generative models suffer from high variance in token editing due to independent Bernoulli/categorical decisions at each step, leading to characteristic failure modes like under-editing (residual noise) or over-editing (unnecessary substitutions), which decreases reproducibility.

Method: Stratified Hazard Sampling (SHS) models per-token edits as events driven by cumulative hazard (CTMC) or cumulative jump mass (DTMC). It places events by stratifying this cumulative quantity: each token uses a single random phase per position and jumps whenever accumulated hazard crosses unit-spaced thresholds. Also introduces a phase-allocation variant for lexical constraints that prioritizes early edits at high-risk positions.

Result: SHS preserves expected number of jumps while achieving minimum possible variance among unbiased integer estimators (bounded by 1/4), without altering per-jump destination sampling, thus retaining multimodality. Reduces characteristic failure modes and improves reproducibility.

Conclusion: SHS provides a hyperparameter-free inference principle for any sampler with stay-vs.-replace decomposition, offering substantial variance reduction in token editing while maintaining unbiasedness and multimodality, addressing key limitations of current discrete generative models.

Abstract: CTMC/DTMC-based discrete generative models, including uniform-noise discrete diffusion (e.g., D3PM/CTDD) and discrete flow matching, enable non-autoregressive sequence generation by repeatedly replacing tokens through a time-inhomogeneous Markov process. Inference is typically implemented with step-based simulation: each token decides to jump via independent Bernoulli (or categorical) draws at every discretization step. Under uniform-noise initialization, where self-correction requires multiple edits per position, these independent decisions induce substantial variance in both the number and timing of edits, leading to characteristic failure modes such as under-editing (residual noise) or over-editing (cascading unnecessary substitutions), decreasing reproducibility.
  We propose Stratified Hazard Sampling (SHS), a drop-in and hyperparameter-free inference principle for any sampler that admits a stay-vs.-replace decomposition. SHS models per-token edits as events driven by cumulative hazard (CTMC) or cumulative jump mass (DTMC) and places events by stratifying this cumulative quantity: with a single random phase per position, a token jumps whenever its accumulated hazard crosses unit-spaced thresholds. This preserves the expected number of jumps while achieving the minimum possible variance among unbiased integer estimators (bounded by 1/4), without altering per-jump destination sampling and thus retaining multimodality. We also introduce a phase-allocation variant for blacklist-style lexical constraints that prioritizes early edits at high-risk positions to mitigate late-masking artifacts.

TL;DR: A hybrid neural network approach combining linear and nonlinear structures with online learning and forecast combination for day-ahead electricity price forecasting, achieving significant accuracy improvements with reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate day-ahead electricity price forecasts are crucial for portfolio management, power plant operations, battery storage optimization, and demand response planning. Existing linear models fail to capture nonlinear relationships, while nonlinear models have high computational costs, creating a need for an efficient yet accurate forecasting method.

Method: A novel multivariate neural network approach that combines linear and nonlinear feed-forward neural structures with online learning and forecast combination. The model incorporates fundamental relationships from wind/solar generation, electricity demand patterns, energy fuel and carbon markets, plus autoregressive dynamics and calendar effects.

Result: The proposed method significantly reduces computational cost while delivering superior forecasting accuracy, achieving 12-13% RMSE and 15-18% MAE reductions compared to state-of-the-art benchmark models, as demonstrated in a six-year forecasting study on major European electricity markets.

Conclusion: The hybrid neural network approach successfully addresses the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency in electricity price forecasting, providing a practical solution that captures both linear and nonlinear market dynamics while maintaining computational feasibility.

Abstract: Precise day-ahead forecasts for electricity prices are crucial to ensure efficient portfolio management, support strategic decision-making for power plant operations, enable efficient battery storage optimization, and facilitate demand response planning. However, developing an accurate prediction model is highly challenging in an uncertain and volatile market environment. For instance, although linear models generally exhibit competitive performance in predicting electricity prices with minimal computational requirements, they fail to capture relevant nonlinear relationships. Nonlinear models, on the other hand, can improve forecasting accuracy with a surge in computational costs. We propose a novel multivariate neural network approach that combines linear and nonlinear feed-forward neural structures. Unlike previous hybrid models, our approach integrates online learning and forecast combination for efficient training and accuracy improvement. It also incorporates all relevant characteristics, particularly the fundamental relationships arising from wind and solar generation, electricity demand patterns, related energy fuel and carbon markets, in addition to autoregressive dynamics and calendar effects. Compared to the current state-of-the-art benchmark models, the proposed forecasting method significantly reduces computational cost while delivering superior forecasting accuracy (12-13% RMSE and 15-18% MAE reductions). Our results are derived from a six-year forecasting study conducted on major European electricity markets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to develop robust regression models that can generalize across different drilling domains/wells for predicting Stick-Slip Index (SSI), a critical metric for assessing torsional vibrations at the drill bit, addressing the challenge of domain shift in drilling applications.

Method: Used 60-second labeled sequences of 1 Hz surface drilling data to train regression models. Employed grid search for hyperparameter optimization. Compared Adversarial Domain Generalization (ADG), Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM), and baseline models. Evaluated transfer learning effectiveness on pre-trained models.

Result: ADG and IRM models achieved 10% and 8% performance improvements respectively over baseline. Severe events detection improved from 20% (baseline) to 60%. ADG slightly outperformed IRM. Transfer learning further improved performance when applied to pre-trained models.

Conclusion: Domain generalization approaches show strong potential in drilling applications, with ADG emerging as the most effective method. Transfer learning provides additional performance benefits, demonstrating the value of domain-invariant representations for cross-well generalization.

Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive comparison of domain generalization techniques applied to time series data within a drilling context, focusing on the prediction of a continuous Stick-Slip Index (SSI), a critical metric for assessing torsional downhole vibrations at the drill bit. The study aims to develop a robust regression model that can generalize across domains by training on 60 second labeled sequences of 1 Hz surface drilling data to predict the SSI. The model is tested in wells that are different from those used during training. To fine-tune the model architecture, a grid search approach is employed to optimize key hyperparameters. A comparative analysis of the Adversarial Domain Generalization (ADG), Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) and baseline models is presented, along with an evaluation of the effectiveness of transfer learning (TL) in improving model performance. The ADG and IRM models achieve performance improvements of 10% and 8%, respectively, over the baseline model. Most importantly, severe events are detected 60% of the time, against 20% for the baseline model. Overall, the results indicate that both ADG and IRM models surpass the baseline, with the ADG model exhibiting a slight advantage over the IRM model. Additionally, applying TL to a pre-trained model further improves performance. Our findings demonstrate the potential of domain generalization approaches in drilling applications, with ADG emerging as the most effective approach.

TL;DR: RPIQ: A novel 4-bit quantization framework for large models that reduces memory by 60-75% while maintaining near-full-precision performance, enabling deployment on assistive devices for visually impaired users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large models are effective for perception and reasoning but impractical for assistive devices due to excessive memory and inference costs. Existing quantization methods suffer from inter-block error accumulation and degraded stability.

Method: Residual-Projected Multi-Collaboration Closed-Loop and Single Instance Quantization (RPIQ) framework using multi-collaborative closed-loop compensation based on Single Instance Calibration and Gauss-Seidel Iterative Quantization.

Result: Compresses models to 4-bit with 60-75% memory reduction while maintaining performance close to full-precision models across language and vision tasks. Works on OPT, Qwen, LLaMA, and CogVLM2 models.

Conclusion: RPIQ enables practical deployment of large models on assistive devices for visually impaired users, advancing computational efficiency and reliability while providing accurate, rapid information access.

Abstract: Visually impaired users face significant challenges in daily information access and real-time environmental perception, and there is an urgent need for intelligent assistive systems with accurate recognition capabilities. Although large-scale models provide effective solutions for perception and reasoning, their practical deployment on assistive devices is severely constrained by excessive memory consumption and high inference costs. Moreover, existing quantization strategies often ignore inter-block error accumulation, leading to degraded model stability. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel quantization framework -- Residual-Projected Multi-Collaboration Closed-Loop and Single Instance Quantization(RPIQ), whose quantization process adopts a multi-collaborative closed-loop compensation scheme based on Single Instance Calibration and Gauss-Seidel Iterative Quantization. Experiments on various types of large-scale models, including language models such as OPT, Qwen, and LLaMA, as well as vision-language models such as CogVLM2, demonstrate that RPIQ can compress models to 4-bit representation while significantly reducing peak memory consumption (approximately 60%-75% reduction compared to original full-precision models). The method maintains performance highly close to full-precision models across multiple language and visual tasks, and exhibits excellent recognition and reasoning capabilities in key applications such as text understanding and visual question answering in complex scenarios. While verifying the effectiveness of RPIQ for deployment in real assistive systems, this study also advances the computational efficiency and reliability of large models, enabling them to provide visually impaired users with the required information accurately and rapidly.

TL;DR: A novel framework using gradient ascent to discover interpretable prompts for controlling LLM personas like sycophancy and hallucination, achieving significant improvement over manual methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for controlling LLM behavioral personas face a dilemma: manual prompt engineering is intuitive but unscalable, while automatic optimization methods are effective but operate as "black boxes" with no interpretable connection to model internals.

Method: Proposes two gradient ascent methods (RESGA and SAEGA) that optimize randomly initialized prompts to achieve better aligned representation with identified persona directions, with fluent gradient ascent to control prompt fluency.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness across Llama 3.1, Qwen 2.5, and Gemma 3 for steering three personas (sycophancy, hallucination, myopic reward). On sycophancy, automatically discovered prompts achieved significant improvement (49.90% compared with 79.24%).

Conclusion: By grounding prompt discovery in mechanistically meaningful features, the method offers a new paradigm for controllable and interpretable behavior modification in LLMs.

Abstract: Controlling emergent behavioral personas (e.g., sycophancy, hallucination) in Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for AI safety, yet remains a persistent challenge. Existing solutions face a dilemma: manual prompt engineering is intuitive but unscalable and imprecise, while automatic optimization methods are effective but operate as "black boxes" with no interpretable connection to model internals. We propose a novel framework that adapts gradient ascent to LLMs, enabling targeted prompt discovery. In specific, we propose two methods, RESGA and SAEGA, that both optimize randomly initialized prompts to achieve better aligned representation with an identified persona direction. We introduce fluent gradient ascent to control the fluency of discovered persona steering prompts. We demonstrate RESGA and SAEGA's effectiveness across Llama 3.1, Qwen 2.5, and Gemma 3 for steering three different personas,sycophancy, hallucination, and myopic reward. Crucially, on sycophancy, our automatically discovered prompts achieve significant improvement (49.90% compared with 79.24%). By grounding prompt discovery in mechanistically meaningful features, our method offers a new paradigm for controllable and interpretable behavior modification.

TL;DR: ChemBART is a SMILES-based LLM pre-trained on chemical reactions that enables unified multi-task chemical problem solving, including synthesis planning, with experimental validation showing improved yields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM approaches for chemical tasks typically address single tasks like precursor prediction, lacking a unified model for comprehensive synthesis planning. There's a need for a model that can handle multiple chemical challenges within a single framework.

Method: Developed ChemBART, a SMILES-based large language model pre-trained on chemical reactions using mask-filling tasks. The model is designed as a unified framework for multiple downstream tasks including precursor/reagent generation, temperature-yield regression, molecular property classification, and integration with reinforcement learning and Monte Carlo tree search for multi-step synthesis route design.

Result: ChemBART successfully addresses multiple chemical tasks within a single model. Most importantly, ChemBART-designed multi-step synthesis routes were experimentally validated, showing shorter pathways with approximately 30% yield improvement over literature benchmarks.

Conclusion: The work validates the effectiveness of reaction-focused pre-training and demonstrates ChemBART's broad utility in advancing the complete synthesis planning cycle, moving beyond single-task models to comprehensive chemical problem solving.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential across diverse fields. While LLMs have been applied to molecular simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) in computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP), existing methodologies typically address single tasks, such as precursor prediction. We introduce ChemBART, a SMILES-based LLM pre-trained on chemical reactions, which enables a unified model for multiple downstream chemical tasks--achieving the paradigm of "one model, one pre-training, multiple tasks." By leveraging outputs from a mask-filling pre-training task on reaction expressions, ChemBART effectively solves a variety of chemical problems, including precursor/reagent generation, temperature-yield regression, molecular property classification, and optimizing the policy and value functions within a reinforcement learning framework, integrated with Monte Carlo tree search for multi-step synthesis route design. Unlike single-molecule pre-trained LLMs constrained to specific applications, ChemBART addresses broader chemical challenges and integrates them for comprehensive synthesis planning. Crucially, ChemBART-designed multi-step synthesis routes and reaction conditions directly inspired wet-lab validation, which confirmed shorter pathways with ~30% yield improvement over literature benchmarks. Our work validates the power of reaction-focused pre-training and showcases the broad utility of ChemBART in advancing the complete synthesis planning cycle.

Conclusion: MixTTE provides a scalable and adaptive framework that effectively addresses limitations of existing production systems by integrating link-level modeling with industrial route-level TTE systems, enabling reliable travel time estimation in large urban networks.

Abstract: Accurate Travel Time Estimation (TTE) is critical for ride-hailing platforms, where errors directly impact user experience and operational efficiency. While existing production systems excel at holistic route-level dependency modeling, they struggle to capture city-scale traffic dynamics and long-tail scenarios, leading to unreliable predictions in large urban networks. In this paper, we propose \model, a scalable and adaptive framework that synergistically integrates link-level modeling with industrial route-level TTE systems. Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal external attention module to capture global traffic dynamic dependencies across million-scale road networks efficiently. Moreover, we construct a stabilized graph mixture-of-experts network to handle heterogeneous traffic patterns while maintaining inference efficiency. Furthermore, an asynchronous incremental learning strategy is tailored to enable real-time and stable adaptation to dynamic traffic distribution shifts. Experiments on real-world datasets validate MixTTE significantly reduces prediction errors compared to seven baselines. MixTTE has been deployed in DiDi, substantially improving the accuracy and stability of the TTE service.

*Waleed Khalid,Dmitry Ignatov,Radu Timofte*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs can autonomously evolve into neural architecture designers through iterative fine-tuning with execution feedback, moving beyond training data to generate novel, high-performing architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs excel at program synthesis, their ability to autonomously design neural architectures that balance syntactic correctness, performance, and structural novelty remains unexplored. The paper aims to transform LLMs from stochastic code generators into autonomous neural designers.

Method: A code-oriented LLM is placed in a closed-loop synthesis framework over 22 fine-tuning cycles. It generates PyTorch convolutional networks, which are validated and evaluated using single-epoch accuracy. Novel architectures are filtered using MinHash-Jaccard to prevent redundancy. High-performing novel architectures become prompt-code pairs for iterative LoRA fine-tuning, initialized from LEMUR dataset.

Result: The LLM internalizes architectural priors, with valid generation rate stabilizing at 50.6% (peak 74.5%). Mean first-epoch accuracy rose from 28.06% to 50.99%, and candidates exceeding 40% accuracy grew from 2.04% to 96.81%. The model synthesized 455 high-performing architectures absent from original training data.

Conclusion: LLMs can internalize empirical, non-textual rewards to transcend their training data, becoming autonomous performance-driven neural designers. The closed-loop framework with execution feedback provides a scalable blueprint for transforming stochastic generators into robust architecture designers.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in program synthesis, yet their ability to autonomously navigate neural architecture design--balancing syntactic reliability, performance, and structural novelty--remains underexplored. We address this by placing a code-oriented LLM within a closed-loop synthesis framework, analyzing its evolution over 22 supervised fine-tuning cycles. The model synthesizes PyTorch convolutional networks which are validated, evaluated via low-fidelity performance signals (single-epoch accuracy), and filtered using a MinHash-Jaccard criterion to prevent structural redundancy. High-performing, novel architectures are converted into prompt-code pairs for iterative fine-tuning via parameter-efficient LoRA adaptation, initialized from the LEMUR dataset. Across cycles, the LLM internalizes empirical architectural priors, becoming a robust generator. The valid generation rate stabilizes at 50.6 percent (peaking at 74.5 percent), while mean first-epoch accuracy rises from 28.06 percent to 50.99 percent, and the fraction of candidates exceeding 40 percent accuracy grows from 2.04 percent to 96.81 percent. Analyses confirm the model moves beyond replicating existing motifs, synthesizing 455 high-performing architectures absent from the original corpus. By grounding code synthesis in execution feedback, this work provides a scalable blueprint for transforming stochastic generators into autonomous, performance-driven neural designers, establishing that LLMs can internalize empirical, non-textual rewards to transcend their training data.

### [101] [Multi-Distribution Robust Conformal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02998)
*Yuqi Yang,Ying Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A conformal prediction method that guarantees uniform coverage across multiple heterogeneous distributions using max-p aggregation and learned conformity scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In fairness and distribution robustness problems, test data may come from arbitrary mixtures of source distributions, requiring prediction sets that maintain coverage guarantees across all distributions.

Method: Proposes max-p aggregation scheme for finite-sample multi-distribution coverage, proves its optimality, and develops algorithm to learn conformity scores that produce efficient prediction sets after aggregation.

Result: Method delivers valid worst-case coverage across multiple distributions while reducing set size compared to naive max-p aggregation, achieving comparable size to single-source prediction sets.

Conclusion: The framework provides a principled approach for multi-distribution conformal prediction with connections to distributionally robust optimization, fairness, and multi-source learning.

Abstract: In many fairness and distribution robustness problems, one has access to labeled data from multiple source distributions yet the test data may come from an arbitrary member or a mixture of them. We study the problem of constructing a conformal prediction set that is uniformly valid across multiple, heterogeneous distributions, in the sense that no matter which distribution the test point is from, the coverage of the prediction set is guaranteed to exceed a pre-specified level. We first propose a max-p aggregation scheme that delivers finite-sample, multi-distribution coverage given any conformity scores associated with each distribution. Upon studying several efficiency optimization programs subject to uniform coverage, we prove the optimality and tightness of our aggregation scheme, and propose a general algorithm to learn conformity scores that lead to efficient prediction sets after the aggregation under standard conditions. We discuss how our framework relates to group-wise distributionally robust optimization, sub-population shift, fairness, and multi-source learning. In synthetic and real-data experiments, our method delivers valid worst-case coverage across multiple distributions while greatly reducing the set size compared with naively applying max-p aggregation to single-source conformity scores, and can be comparable in size to single-source prediction sets with popular, standard conformity scores.

*Anaïs Berkes,Vincent Taboga,Donna Vakalis,David Rolnick,Yoshua Bengio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPICE is a Bayesian in-context RL method that learns Q-value priors via deep ensembles and performs online Bayesian updates for fast adaptation, achieving near-optimal performance even with suboptimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current in-context RL methods either can't improve beyond training distribution or require near-optimal data, limiting practical adoption. There's a need for methods that can adapt quickly to unseen environments without parameter updates while being robust to suboptimal training data.

Method: SPICE learns a prior over Q-values using deep ensembles during training. At test time, it performs Bayesian updates on this prior using in-context information. To handle poor priors from suboptimal data, it uses an Upper-Confidence Bound rule for exploration and adaptation.

Result: SPICE achieves regret-optimal behavior in both stochastic bandits and finite-horizon MDPs, even when pretrained on suboptimal trajectories. It achieves near-optimal decisions on unseen tasks, substantially reduces regret compared to prior methods, and rapidly adapts to unseen tasks while remaining robust to distribution shift.

Conclusion: SPICE demonstrates that Bayesian in-context RL with deep ensembles and online Bayesian updates can achieve fast adaptation to unseen environments without parameter updates, even when trained on suboptimal data, making in-context RL more practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) promises fast adaptation to unseen environments without parameter updates, but current methods either cannot improve beyond the training distribution or require near-optimal data, limiting practical adoption. We introduce SPICE, a Bayesian ICRL method that learns a prior over Q-values via deep ensemble and updates this prior at test-time using in-context information through Bayesian updates. To recover from poor priors resulting from training on sub-optimal data, our online inference follows an Upper-Confidence Bound rule that favours exploration and adaptation. We prove that SPICE achieves regret-optimal behaviour in both stochastic bandits and finite-horizon MDPs, even when pretrained only on suboptimal trajectories. We validate these findings empirically across bandit and control benchmarks. SPICE achieves near-optimal decisions on unseen tasks, substantially reduces regret compared to prior ICRL and meta-RL approaches while rapidly adapting to unseen tasks and remaining robust under distribution shift.

*Vidhi Rathore*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CMF is a framework that ensures fairness by making the geometric structure of data manifolds invariant to sensitive attributes, bridging causal inference and geometric deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard fairness approaches ignore the underlying generative structure of data and how sensitive attributes causally warp the geometry of data manifolds, not just shift distributions.

Method: CMF learns latent representations where local Riemannian geometry (metric tensor and curvature) remains invariant under counterfactual interventions on sensitive attributes, using constraints on decoder Jacobian and Hessian.

Result: CMF effectively disentangles sensitive geometric warping while preserving task utility, validated on synthetic Structural Causal Models with rigorous quantification of fairness-utility trade-off via geometric metrics.

Conclusion: CMF offers a novel geometric approach to fairness that addresses causal warping of data manifolds by sensitive attributes, providing a principled framework for ensuring geometric invariance across demographic groups.

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning is increasingly critical, yet standard approaches often treat data as static points in a high-dimensional space, ignoring the underlying generative structure. We posit that sensitive attributes (e.g., race, gender) do not merely shift data distributions but causally warp the geometry of the data manifold itself. To address this, we introduce Causal Manifold Fairness (CMF), a novel framework that bridges causal inference and geometric deep learning. CMF learns a latent representation where the local Riemannian geometry, defined by the metric tensor and curvature, remains invariant under counterfactual interventions on sensitive attributes. By enforcing constraints on the Jacobian and Hessian of the decoder, CMF ensures that the rules of the latent space (distances and shapes) are preserved across demographic groups. We validate CMF on synthetic Structural Causal Models (SCMs), demonstrating that it effectively disentangles sensitive geometric warping while preserving task utility, offering a rigorous quantification of the fairness-utility trade-off via geometric metrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAE-based mechanistic interpretability shows promise for LLM oversight but exhibits fragility in feature steering, requiring caution about reliability for safety-critical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To stress-test Anthropic's claims about understanding and controlling LLMs through sparse autoencoders (SAEs), specifically examining whether SAE-based interpretability provides reliable human oversight for AI safety.

Method: Replicated Anthropic's main results using open-source SAEs for Llama 3.1, testing feature extraction and steering capabilities while examining fragility across layer selection, steering magnitude, and context.

Result: While basic feature extraction and steering were reproduced, the approach showed substantial fragility: feature steering was sensitive to layer selection, steering magnitude, and context; non-standard activation behavior was observed; distinguishing thematically similar features was difficult.

Conclusion: Current SAE-based interpretability methods lack systematic reliability for safety-critical applications, suggesting a necessary shift from focusing on interpretability of internal representations toward reliable prediction and control of model output.

Abstract: Recent work by Anthropic on Mechanistic interpretability claims to understand and control Large Language Models by extracting human-interpretable features from their neural activation patterns using sparse autoencoders (SAEs). If successful, this approach offers one of the most promising routes for human oversight in AI safety. We conduct an initial stress-test of these claims by replicating their main results with open-source SAEs for Llama 3.1. While we successfully reproduce basic feature extraction and steering capabilities, our investigation suggests that major caution is warranted regarding the generalizability of these claims. We find that feature steering exhibits substantial fragility, with sensitivity to layer selection, steering magnitude, and context. We observe non-standard activation behavior and demonstrate the difficulty to distinguish thematically similar features from one another. While SAE-based interpretability produces compelling demonstrations in selected cases, current methods often fall short of the systematic reliability required for safety-critical applications. This suggests a necessary shift in focus from prioritizing interpretability of internal representations toward reliable prediction and control of model output. Our work contributes to a more nuanced understanding of what mechanistic interpretability has achieved and highlights fundamental challenges for AI safety that remain unresolved.

Motivation: KV-cache memory growth bottlenecks LLM serving throughput under concurrent loads; existing compression methods have limitations in scalability, disruption of tensor layouts, or require specialized hardware.

Method: Joint encoding of KV-cache blocks that fuses similar blocks across requests and input chunks into shared representations while preserving standard cache structure, analyzed theoretically under Poisson process model.

Result: Achieves up to 4.38× KV-cache compression with negligible accuracy loss across diverse LLMs and benchmarks, outperforming structured and adaptive compression baselines; improves token throughput by ~40% in real LLM serving.

Conclusion: Joint encoding effectively alleviates KV-cache memory bottleneck for high-concurrency LLM serving without specialized hardware, demonstrating substantial inference throughput gains.

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) drive interactive AI systems but are bottlenecked by the memory-heavy growth of key-value (KV) caches, which limits real-time throughput under concurrent loads. Existing KV-cache compression methods rely on rigid heuristics, disrupt tensor layouts, or require specialized compute, hindering scalability and deployment.
  We propose joint encoding of KV-cache blocks, which fuses similar blocks across requests and input chunks into shared representations while preserving standard cache structure. This alleviates the KV-cache memory bottleneck, supporting high-concurrency serving without specialized hardware. Theoretically, we analyze the rate-distortion tradeoff of fused cache blocks under a Poisson process model. Empirically, our method achieves up to 4.38 $\times$ KV-cache compression with negligible accuracy loss across diverse LLMs and benchmarks, outperforming recent structured and adaptive compression baselines. In real LLM serving, joint encoding improves the token throughput by $\sim$40\% on a single-machine vLLM benchmark, demonstrating substantial gains in inference throughput.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Next-generation networks need automated anomaly detection for reliability, especially in IIoT with multi-dimensional heterogeneous data. Existing methods struggle with complexity and dynamism of IIoT data streams.

Method: Combines multi-source prediction model with novel concept drift adaptation technique for anomaly detection in IIoT streaming data, focusing on handling dynamic data patterns.

Result: Achieves up to 89.71% accuracy (AUC) in trace-driven evaluations, outperforming state-of-the-art methods while meeting efficiency and scalability requirements.

Conclusion: Proposed method effectively addresses challenges of IIoT anomaly detection by combining prediction modeling with drift adaptation, offering accurate, efficient, and scalable solution for industrial IoT environments.

Abstract: To ensure reliability and service availability, next-generation networks are expected to rely on automated anomaly detection systems powered by advanced machine learning methods with the capability of handling multi-dimensional data. Such multi-dimensional, heterogeneous data occurs mostly in today's industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), where real-time detection of anomalies is critical to prevent impending failures and resolve them in a timely manner. However, existing anomaly detection methods often fall short of effectively coping with the complexity and dynamism of multi-dimensional data streams in IIoT. In this paper, we propose an adaptive method for detecting anomalies in IIoT streaming data utilizing a multi-source prediction model and concept drift adaptation. The proposed anomaly detection algorithm merges a prediction model into a novel drift adaptation method resulting in accurate and efficient anomaly detection that exhibits improved scalability. Our trace-driven evaluations indicate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods by achieving up to an 89.71% accuracy (in terms of Area under the Curve (AUC)) while meeting the given efficiency and scalability requirements.

TL;DR: BAFA is a query-efficient active fairness auditing method for black-box LLMs that uses uncertainty estimation and active query selection to reduce the number of queries needed for fairness evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs exhibit systematic biases across demographic groups, but traditional auditing methods require resource-intensive query access to black-box models, making continuous fairness evaluations challenging.

Method: BAFA conceptualizes auditing as uncertainty estimation over fairness metrics, maintains a version space of surrogate models consistent with queried scores, and uses active query selection to narrow uncertainty intervals via constrained empirical risk minimization.

Result: BAFA achieves target error thresholds with up to 40× fewer queries than stratified sampling (e.g., 144 vs 5,956 queries at ε=0.02 for CivilComments), shows substantially better performance over time, and demonstrates lower variance across runs.

Conclusion: Active sampling can significantly reduce resources needed for independent fairness auditing of LLMs, supporting more practical and continuous model evaluations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit systematic biases across demographic groups. Auditing is proposed as an accountability tool for black-box LLM applications, but suffers from resource-intensive query access. We conceptualise auditing as uncertainty estimation over a target fairness metric and introduce BAFA, the Bounded Active Fairness Auditor for query-efficient auditing of black-box LLMs. BAFA maintains a version space of surrogate models consistent with queried scores and computes uncertainty intervals for fairness metrics (e.g., $Δ$ AUC) via constrained empirical risk minimisation. Active query selection narrows these intervals to reduce estimation error. We evaluate BAFA on two standard fairness dataset case studies: \textsc{CivilComments} and \textsc{Bias-in-Bios}, comparing against stratified sampling, power sampling, and ablations. BAFA achieves target error thresholds with up to 40$\times$ fewer queries than stratified sampling (e.g., 144 vs 5,956 queries at $\varepsilon=0.02$ for \textsc{CivilComments}) for tight thresholds, demonstrates substantially better performance over time, and shows lower variance across runs. These results suggest that active sampling can reduce resources needed for independent fairness auditing with LLMs, supporting continuous model evaluations.

*Tuc Nguyen,Thai Le*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ATLAS is an adaptive test-time steering framework that uses a lightweight verifier to dynamically control when and how strongly to steer LLM reasoning, improving accuracy while reducing token usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing activation/latent steering methods use fixed policies and static intervention strengths, which lack robustness across different problem instances and often lead to over- or under-steering issues.

Method: ATLAS uses an external lightweight latent verifier that analyzes intermediate hidden states to predict reasoning quality, then adaptively selects whether and how strongly to apply steering on a per-example, per-step basis.

Result: Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show ATLAS consistently outperforms vanilla decoding and fixed steering baselines, achieving higher accuracy while substantially reducing test-time token usage.

Conclusion: Verifier-guided latent adaptation provides an effective and scalable mechanism for controlling reasoning efficiency without sacrificing solution quality, representing the first integration of learned latent verification into test-time steering for LLMs.

Abstract: Recent work on activation and latent steering has demonstrated that modifying internal representations can effectively guide large language models (LLMs) toward improved reasoning and efficiency without additional training. However, most existing approaches rely on fixed steering policies and static intervention strengths, which limit their robustness across problem instances and often result in over- or under-steering. We propose Adaptive Test-time Latent Steering, called (ATLAS), a task- specific framework that dynamically controls steering decisions at inference time using an external, lightweight latent verifier. Given intermediate hidden states, the verifier predicts the quality of ongoing reasoning and adaptively selects whether and how strongly to apply steering, enabling per-example and per-step adjustment with minimal overhead. To our knowledge, ATLAS is the first method to integrate learned latent verification into test-time steering for enhancing LLMs reasoning. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that ATLAS consistently outperforms both vanilla decoding and fixed steering baselines, achieving higher accuracy while substantially reducing test-time token usage. These results demonstrate that verifier-guided latent adaptation provides an effective and scalable mechanism for controlling reasoning efficiency without sacrificing solution quality. All source code will be publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a more physiologically grounded approach for translating surface electromyography (sEMG) signals into text for wearable and mixed-reality systems, moving beyond direct letter recognition to a hierarchical framework that mirrors natural typing processes.

Method: Three-stage hierarchical framework: 1) CNN-BiLSTM-Attention model classifies finger activations from multichannel sEMG, 2) ergonomic typing priors infer letters from finger patterns, 3) fine-tuned T5 transformer reconstructs full sentences from letter sequences.

Result: Outperforms baselines with 85.4% finger-classification accuracy, 5.4% character error rate (CER), and 6.5% word error rate (WER) on 30 users from emg2qwerty dataset.

Conclusion: MyoText establishes a principled pathway from neuromuscular signals to text, providing a blueprint for virtual/augmented-reality typing interfaces without physical keyboards and advancing wearable neural input for ubiquitous computing.

Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) provides a direct neural interface for decoding muscle activity and offers a promising foundation for keyboard-free text input in wearable and mixed-reality systems. Previous sEMG-to-text studies mainly focused on recognizing letters directly from sEMG signals, forming an important first step toward translating muscle activity into text. Building on this foundation, we present MyoText, a hierarchical framework that decodes sEMG signals to text through physiologically grounded intermediate stages. MyoText first classifies finger activations from multichannel sEMG using a CNN-BiLSTM-Attention model, applies ergonomic typing priors to infer letters, and reconstructs full sentences with a fine-tuned T5 transformer. This modular design mirrors the natural hierarchy of typing, linking muscle intent to language output and reducing the search space for decoding. Evaluated on 30 users from the emg2qwerty dataset, MyoText outperforms baselines by achieving 85.4% finger-classification accuracy, 5.4% character error rate (CER), and 6.5% word error rate (WER). Beyond accuracy gains, this methodology establishes a principled pathway from neuromuscular signals to text, providing a blueprint for virtual and augmented-reality typing interfaces that operate entirely without physical keyboards. By integrating ergonomic structure with transformer-based linguistic reasoning, MyoText advances the feasibility of seamless, wearable neural input for future ubiquitous computing environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TASC is a time-aware synthetic control method that incorporates temporal structure using state-space models with constant trends, improving performance in settings with strong trends and noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing synthetic control methods treat pre-intervention time indices as interchangeable, failing to leverage temporal structure when strong trends are present, which limits their effectiveness in time-series panel data analysis.

Method: TASC uses a state-space model with constant trend while preserving low-rank signal structure. It employs Kalman filter and Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother, fitting a generative time-series model with expectation-maximization before performing counterfactual inference.

Result: Evaluation on simulated and real-world datasets (policy evaluation and sports prediction) shows TASC offers advantages in settings with strong temporal trends and high observation noise.

Conclusion: TASC improves upon traditional synthetic control methods by incorporating temporal structure, making it particularly effective for observational causal inference in time-series panel data with strong trends and noise.

Abstract: The synthetic control (SC) framework is widely used for observational causal inference with time-series panel data. SC has been successful in diverse applications, but existing methods typically treat the ordering of pre-intervention time indices interchangeable. This invariance means they may not fully take advantage of temporal structure when strong trends are present. We propose Time-Aware Synthetic Control (TASC), which employs a state-space model with a constant trend while preserving a low-rank structure of the signal. TASC uses the Kalman filter and Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother: it first fits a generative time-series model with expectation-maximization and then performs counterfactual inference. We evaluate TASC on both simulated and real-world datasets, including policy evaluation and sports prediction. Our results suggest that TASC offers advantages in settings with strong temporal trends and high levels of observation noise.

TL;DR: A single strategically engineered math reasoning sample can produce significant performance improvements across multiple domains with RL, challenging the assumption that large datasets are necessary for LLM reasoning enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL approaches for LLMs require thousands of high-quality samples, but this paper challenges this fundamental assumption by exploring whether one-shot learning can be effective for enhancing reasoning capabilities across multiple domains.

Method: Introduces "polymath learning" - a framework for designing one training sample that elicits multidisciplinary impact. The method involves strategically selecting or engineering a single math reasoning sample that integrates multidisciplinary elements, focusing on sample quality and design rather than quantity.

Result: Three key findings: (1) A single strategically selected math reasoning sample produces significant performance improvements across physics, chemistry, and biology with RL; (2) Math skills salient to reasoning suggest characteristics of optimal polymath samples; (3) Engineered synthetic samples integrating multidisciplinary elements outperform training with naturally occurring individual samples. The approach achieves superior performance to training with larger datasets across various reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Sample quality and design, rather than quantity, may be key to unlocking enhanced reasoning capabilities in LLMs. The results suggest a paradigm shift toward "sample engineering" - precision engineering of training samples rather than simply increasing data volume.

Abstract: The reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) can be unleashed with reinforcement learning (RL) (OpenAI, 2024; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025a; Zeng et al., 2025). The success of existing RL attempts in LLMs usually relies on high-quality samples of thousands or beyond. In this paper, we challenge fundamental assumptions about data requirements in RL for LLMs by demonstrating the remarkable effectiveness of one-shot learning. Specifically, we introduce polymath learning, a framework for designing one training sample that elicits multidisciplinary impact. We present three key findings: (1) A single, strategically selected math reasoning sample can produce significant performance improvements across multiple domains, including physics, chemistry, and biology with RL; (2) The math skills salient to reasoning suggest the characteristics of the optimal polymath sample; and (3) An engineered synthetic sample that integrates multidiscipline elements outperforms training with individual samples that naturally occur. Our approach achieves superior performance to training with larger datasets across various reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that sample quality and design, rather than quantity, may be the key to unlock enhanced reasoning capabilities in language models. Our results suggest a shift, dubbed as sample engineering, toward precision engineering of training samples rather than simply increasing data volume.

TL;DR: PersonaLedger is a synthetic financial transaction generator that combines LLM-driven behavioral diversity with programmatic rule enforcement to create realistic, privacy-preserving datasets for financial AI research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Strict privacy regulations limit access to real transaction data, slowing financial AI research. Existing synthetic data generators either lack behavioral diversity (rule-based simulators) or violate financial constraints (learning-based generators like GANs).

Method: Combines large language models conditioned on rich user personas for behavioral diversity with a configurable programmatic engine for financial rule enforcement. The LLM and engine interact in a closed loop: after each event, the engine updates user state, enforces rules, and provides context-aware prompts to guide the LLM toward feasible next actions.

Result: Created a public dataset of 30 million transactions from 23,000 users and a benchmark suite with two tasks: illiquidity classification and identity theft segmentation. The system produces realistic, privacy-preserving synthetic data that maintains financial correctness.

Conclusion: PersonaLedger provides a realistic, privacy-preserving resource for financial AI research, enabling rigorous evaluation of forecasting and anomaly detection models while accelerating innovation through accessible synthetic data generation.

Abstract: Strict privacy regulations limit access to real transaction data, slowing open research in financial AI. Synthetic data can bridge this gap, but existing generators do not jointly achieve behavioral diversity and logical groundedness. Rule-driven simulators rely on hand-crafted workflows and shallow stochasticity, which miss the richness of human behavior. Learning-based generators such as GANs capture correlations yet often violate hard financial constraints and still require training on private data. We introduce PersonaLedger, a generation engine that uses a large language model conditioned on rich user personas to produce diverse transaction streams, coupled with an expert configurable programmatic engine that maintains correctness. The LLM and engine interact in a closed loop: after each event, the engine updates the user state, enforces financial rules, and returns a context aware "nextprompt" that guides the LLM toward feasible next actions. With this engine, we create a public dataset of 30 million transactions from 23,000 users and a benchmark suite with two tasks, illiquidity classification and identity theft segmentation. PersonaLedger offers a realistic, privacy preserving resource that supports rigorous evaluation of forecasting and anomaly detection models. PersonaLedger offers the community a rich, realistic, and privacy preserving resource -- complete with code, rules, and generation logs -- to accelerate innovation in financial AI and enable rigorous, reproducible evaluation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for generating prompt-counterfactual explanations (PCEs) to understand what causes specific output characteristics in generative AI systems, adapting traditional counterfactual explanations to handle non-deterministic generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As generative AI systems are integrated into real-world applications, organizations need to understand what causes specific output characteristics (like toxicity, sentiment, or bias) to ensure transparency, accountability, and regulatory compliance.

Method: The authors adapt counterfactual explanations from XAI literature to generative AI systems, proposing a flexible framework and algorithm for generating prompt-counterfactual explanations (PCEs) that work with downstream classifiers to reveal output characteristics.

Result: Three case studies demonstrate PCEs for analyzing political leaning, toxicity, and sentiment in generative AI outputs. PCEs help streamline prompt engineering to suppress undesirable characteristics and enhance red-teaming efforts to uncover problematic prompts.

Conclusion: This work establishes a foundation for prompt-focused interpretability in generative AI, which will become essential as models handle higher-stakes tasks and face regulatory requirements for transparency and accountability.

Abstract: As generative AI systems become integrated into real-world applications, organizations increasingly need to be able to understand and interpret their behavior. In particular, decision-makers need to understand what causes generative AI systems to exhibit specific output characteristics. Within this general topic, this paper examines a key question: what is it about the input -the prompt- that causes an LLM-based generative AI system to produce output that exhibits specific characteristics, such as toxicity, negative sentiment, or political bias. To examine this question, we adapt a common technique from the Explainable AI literature: counterfactual explanations. We explain why traditional counterfactual explanations cannot be applied directly to generative AI systems, due to several differences in how generative AI systems function. We then propose a flexible framework that adapts counterfactual explanations to non-deterministic, generative AI systems in scenarios where downstream classifiers can reveal key characteristics of their outputs. Based on this framework, we introduce an algorithm for generating prompt-counterfactual explanations (PCEs). Finally, we demonstrate the production of counterfactual explanations for generative AI systems with three case studies, examining different output characteristics (viz., political leaning, toxicity, and sentiment). The case studies further show that PCEs can streamline prompt engineering to suppress undesirable output characteristics and can enhance red-teaming efforts to uncover additional prompts that elicit undesirable outputs. Ultimately, this work lays a foundation for prompt-focused interpretability in generative AI: a capability that will become indispensable as these models are entrusted with higher-stakes tasks and subject to emerging regulatory requirements for transparency and accountability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RATS is a high-performance Rust library for time series augmentation with Python bindings that achieves 74.5% average speedup and up to 47.9% less memory usage compared to existing Python libraries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series augmentation libraries in Python have performance bottlenecks with exponential runtime growth as dataset sizes increase, limiting their applicability in large-scale production systems.

Method: Developed RATS (Rapid Augmentations for Time Series) - a Rust library with Python bindings (RATSpy) implementing multiple augmentation methods including basic transformations, frequency-domain operations, and time warping techniques with a unified pipeline interface and built-in parallelization.

Result: Benchmarking on 143 datasets shows RATSpy achieves average 74.5% speedup over tsaug (up to 94.8% on large datasets) with up to 47.9% less peak memory usage.

Conclusion: RATS provides a high-performance solution for time series augmentation that overcomes the scalability limitations of existing Python libraries, making it suitable for large-scale production systems.

Abstract: Time series augmentation is critical for training robust deep learning models, particularly in domains where labelled data is scarce and expensive to obtain. However, existing augmentation libraries for time series, mainly written in Python, suffer from performance bottlenecks, where running time grows exponentially as dataset sizes increase -- an aspect limiting their applicability in large-scale, production-grade systems. We introduce RATS (Rapid Augmentations for Time Series), a high-performance library for time series augmentation written in Rust with Python bindings (RATSpy). RATS implements multiple augmentation methods spanning basic transformations, frequency-domain operations and time warping techniques, all accessible through a unified pipeline interface with built-in parallelisation. Comprehensive benchmarking of RATSpy versus a commonly used library (tasug) on 143 datasets demonstrates that RATSpy achieves an average speedup of 74.5\% over tsaug (up to 94.8\% on large datasets), with up to 47.9\% less peak memory usage.

*Shuai Jiang,Alexey Voronin,Eric Cyr,Ben Southworth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PGD (preconditioned gradient descent) mitigates spectral bias and reduces grokking delays by enabling uniform parameter exploration in NTK regime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spectral bias limits learning of fine-scale structures in scientific tasks, and grokking delays rapid training. Understanding how optimization affects these phenomena is crucial for improving neural network training.

Method: Theoretical and empirical study of preconditioned gradient descent (PGD, e.g., Gauss-Newton) impact on spectral bias and grokking. Tests how PGD enables uniform parameter space exploration in NTK regime.

Result: PGD mitigates spectral bias issues and reduces grokking delays. Experimental evidence confirms grokking represents transitional behavior between lazy (NTK) and rich learning regimes.

Conclusion: PGD optimization dynamics help overcome spectral bias limitations and accelerate learning transitions, deepening understanding of neural network learning phases and optimization-spectral bias interplay.

Abstract: Spectral bias, the tendency of neural networks to learn low frequencies first, can be both a blessing and a curse. While it enhances the generalization capabilities by suppressing high-frequency noise, it can be a limitation in scientific tasks that require capturing fine-scale structures. The delayed generalization phenomenon known as grokking is another barrier to rapid training of neural networks. Grokking has been hypothesized to arise as learning transitions from the NTK to the feature-rich regime. This paper explores the impact of preconditioned gradient descent (PGD), such as Gauss-Newton, on spectral bias and grokking phenomena. We demonstrate through theoretical and empirical results how PGD can mitigate issues associated with spectral bias. Additionally, building on the rich learning regime grokking hypothesis, we study how PGD can be used to reduce delays associated with grokking. Our conjecture is that PGD, without the impediment of spectral bias, enables uniform exploration of the parameter space in the NTK regime. Our experimental results confirm this prediction, providing strong evidence that grokking represents a transitional behavior between the lazy regime characterized by the NTK and the rich regime. These findings deepen our understanding of the interplay between optimization dynamics, spectral bias, and the phases of neural network learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A dynamic multi-objective optimization method that prioritizes influential hyperparameters based on objective trade-offs, accelerating convergence and improving Pareto front quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MOO methods treat all hyperparameters equally, ignoring that hyperparameter importance varies with objective trade-offs, leading to inefficient optimization.

Method: Integrates HyperSHAP-based hyperparameter importance analysis into ParEGO MOO algorithm, dynamically adapts configuration space by fixing unimportant hyperparameters to focus search on important ones.

Result: Empirical validation on PyMOO and YAHPO-Gym tasks shows improved convergence speed and Pareto front quality compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Dynamic hyperparameter prioritization based on objective trade-offs effectively accelerates MOO convergence and yields better solutions than traditional equal-treatment approaches.

Abstract: Choosing a suitable ML model is a complex task that can depend on several objectives, e.g., accuracy, model size, fairness, inference time, or energy consumption. In practice, this requires trading off multiple, often competing, objectives through multi-objective optimization (MOO). However, existing MOO methods typically treat all hyperparameters as equally important, overlooking that hyperparameter importance (HPI) can vary significantly depending on the trade-off between objectives. We propose a novel dynamic optimization approach that prioritizes the most influential hyperparameters based on varying objective trade-offs during the search process, which accelerates empirical convergence and leads to better solutions. Building on prior work on HPI for MOO post-analysis, we now integrate HPI, calculated with HyperSHAP, into the optimization. For this, we leverage the objective weightings naturally produced by the MOO algorithm ParEGO and adapt the configuration space by fixing the unimportant hyperparameters, allowing the search to focus on the important ones. Eventually, we validate our method with diverse tasks from PyMOO and YAHPO-Gym. Empirical results demonstrate improvements in convergence speed and Pareto front quality compared to baselines.

TL;DR: Large-scale dataset and deep learning model for predicting time pressure in powered two-wheeler riders, showing significant safety impacts and enabling proactive safety interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time pressure critically influences risky maneuvers and crash proneness among powered two-wheeler riders, but its prediction remains underexplored in intelligent transportation systems. There's a need to understand and predict time pressure to improve rider safety.

Method: Created large-scale dataset of 129,000+ labeled multivariate time-series sequences from 153 rides by 51 participants under different time pressure conditions. Proposed MotoTimePressure deep learning model combining convolutional preprocessing, dual-stage temporal attention, and Squeeze-and-Excitation feature recalibration.

Result: High Time Pressure induces 48% higher speeds, 36.4% greater speed variability, 58% more risky turns, 36% more sudden braking, and 50% higher rear brake forces. MotoTimePressure achieved 91.53% accuracy and 98.93% ROC AUC, outperforming eight baselines. Using predicted time pressure improved collision risk prediction accuracy from 91.25% to 93.51%.

Conclusion: Time pressure prediction enables proactive ITS interventions including adaptive alerts, haptic feedback, V2I signaling, and speed guidance, supporting safer two-wheeler mobility under the Safe System Approach. The dataset and model provide valuable tools for understanding and mitigating time pressure effects on rider safety.

Abstract: Time pressure critically influences risky maneuvers and crash proneness among powered two-wheeler riders, yet its prediction remains underexplored in intelligent transportation systems. We present a large-scale dataset of 129,000+ labeled multivariate time-series sequences from 153 rides by 51 participants under No, Low, and High Time Pressure conditions. Each sequence captures 63 features spanning vehicle kinematics, control inputs, behavioral violations, and environmental context. Our empirical analysis shows High Time Pressure induces 48% higher speeds, 36.4% greater speed variability, 58% more risky turns at intersections, 36% more sudden braking, and 50% higher rear brake forces versus No Time Pressure. To benchmark this dataset, we propose MotoTimePressure, a deep learning model combining convolutional preprocessing, dual-stage temporal attention, and Squeeze-and-Excitation feature recalibration, achieving 91.53% accuracy and 98.93% ROC AUC, outperforming eight baselines. Since time pressure cannot be directly measured in real time, we demonstrate its utility in collision prediction and threshold determination. Using MTPS-predicted time pressure as features, improves Informer-based collision risk accuracy from 91.25% to 93.51%, approaching oracle performance (93.72%). Thresholded time pressure states capture rider cognitive stress and enable proactive ITS interventions, including adaptive alerts, haptic feedback, V2I signaling, and speed guidance, supporting safer two-wheeler mobility under the Safe System Approach.

TL;DR: Theoretical framework for sparse knowledge distillation using probability-domain softening operators, with operator-agnostic bias-variance analysis, homotopy path formalization, convergence guarantees, and equivalence class characterizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide theoretical grounding for sparse knowledge distillation, particularly for black-box teacher distillation, partial-access settings (like top-k truncation and text-only outputs), and privacy-preserving model compression.

Method: Develops a unified theoretical framework based on probability-domain softening operators with axiomatic definitions (ranking preservation, continuity, entropy monotonicity, identity, boundary behavior). Framework includes operator-agnostic bias-variance decompositions, homotopy path formalization of multi-stage pruning, convergence guarantees, and equivalence class characterizations.

Result: Establishes when sparse students outperform dense teachers, explains why iterative compression succeeds where one-shot pruning fails, provides O(1/n) convergence rates for n-stage distillation, identifies distinct probability-domain operators yielding identical student models under capacity constraints, and shows all guarantees hold uniformly across operator class.

Conclusion: The framework provides comprehensive theoretical foundations for sparse knowledge distillation that are independent of implementation details, supporting practical applications in black-box distillation, partial-access scenarios, and privacy-preserving compression.

Abstract: We develop a unified theoretical framework for sparse knowledge distillation based on probability-domain softening operators. While the equivalence $p^{1/T} \propto \mathrm{softmax}(z/T)$ is well known, our contribution is an operator-level analytical framework built on this foundation rather than the equivalence itself.
  The framework comprises four core components: (i) operator-agnostic bias--variance decompositions that characterize when sparse students outperform dense teachers, (ii) a homotopy path formalization of multi-stage pruning in function space explaining why iterative compression succeeds where one-shot pruning fails, (iii) convergence guarantees establishing $O(1/n)$ rates for $n$-stage distillation with explicit parameter dependence, and (iv) equivalence class characterizations identifying distinct probability-domain operators that yield identical student models under capacity constraints.
  We introduce an axiomatic definition of probability-domain softening operators based on ranking preservation, continuity, entropy monotonicity, identity, and boundary behavior, and show that multiple non-equivalent operator families satisfy these axioms. All learning-theoretic guarantees are shown to hold uniformly across this operator class, independent of implementation details. These results provide theoretical grounding for black-box teacher distillation, partial-access settings such as top-$k$ truncation and text-only outputs, and privacy-preserving model compression.

TL;DR: VC-IFEval: A new benchmark for evaluating multimodal LLMs' instruction-following ability with vision-dependent constraints, addressing limitations of text-only evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs' instruction-following capabilities focus only on verbal/textual instructions, ignoring implicit constraints in visual modality. This prevents thorough analysis of how well models follow instructions that depend on visual content.

Method: Introduce VC-IFEval benchmark with systematically constructed dataset that incorporates vision-dependent constraints into instruction design. Fine-tune MLLMs on this dataset to improve visual instruction-following performance.

Result: Fine-tuning MLLMs on the VC-IFEval dataset achieves substantial gains in visual instruction-following accuracy and adherence. Extensive evaluation across representative MLLMs provides new insights into current models' strengths and limitations.

Conclusion: VC-IFEval enables more rigorous and fine-grained assessment of MLLMs' ability to align outputs with both visual input and textual instructions, addressing a critical gap in multimodal instruction-following evaluation.

Abstract: Evaluating the instruction-following (IF) capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is essential for rigorously assessing how faithfully model outputs adhere to user-specified intentions. Nevertheless, existing benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs' instruction-following capability primarily focus on verbal instructions in the textual modality. These limitations hinder a thorough analysis of instruction-following capabilities, as they overlook the implicit constraints embedded in the semantically rich visual modality. To address this gap, we introduce VC-IFEval, a new benchmark accompanied by a systematically constructed dataset that evaluates MLLMs' instruction-following ability under multimodal settings. Our benchmark systematically incorporates vision-dependent constraints into instruction design, enabling a more rigorous and fine-grained assessment of how well MLLMs align their outputs with both visual input and textual instructions. Furthermore, by fine-tuning MLLMs on our dataset, we achieve substantial gains in visual instruction-following accuracy and adherence. Through extensive evaluation across representative MLLMs, we provide new insights into the strengths and limitations of current models.

*Davi Valério,Chrysoula Zerva,Mariana Pinto,Ricardo Santos,André Carreiro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CF-GU extends Counterfactual Fairness audits by incorporating causal graph uncertainty through bootstrapped causal discovery and entropy-based uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Counterfactual Fairness audits rely on a single causal graph, which is rarely known with certainty in real-world scenarios, limiting the reliability of bias evaluations.

Method: CF-GU bootstraps causal discovery under domain knowledge constraints to generate multiple plausible DAGs, quantifies graph uncertainty using normalized Shannon entropy, and provides confidence bounds on CF metrics.

Result: Experiments on synthetic data show how different domain knowledge assumptions affect fairness audits, while real-world tests on COMPAS and Adult datasets successfully identify known biases with high confidence even with minimal domain knowledge.

Conclusion: CF-GU provides a more robust bias evaluation framework that accounts for causal graph uncertainty, making fairness audits more reliable in practical applications where causal relationships are uncertain.

Abstract: Evaluating machine learning (ML) model bias is key to building trustworthy and robust ML systems. Counterfactual Fairness (CF) audits allow the measurement of bias of ML models with a causal framework, yet their conclusions rely on a single causal graph that is rarely known with certainty in real-world scenarios. We propose CF with Graph Uncertainty (CF-GU), a bias evaluation procedure that incorporates the uncertainty of specifying a causal graph into CF. CF-GU (i) bootstraps a Causal Discovery algorithm under domain knowledge constraints to produce a bag of plausible Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), (ii) quantifies graph uncertainty with the normalized Shannon entropy, and (iii) provides confidence bounds on CF metrics. Experiments on synthetic data show how contrasting domain knowledge assumptions support or refute audits of CF, while experiments on real-world data (COMPAS and Adult datasets) pinpoint well-known biases with high confidence, even when supplied with minimal domain knowledge constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior diffusion unlearning methods rely on supervised weight edits or global penalties, while RL approaches optimize sparse end-of-trajectory rewards leading to high-variance updates and weak credit assignment. There's a need for more stable and effective RL-based unlearning methods.

Method: Treats denoising as a sequential decision process and introduces a timestep-aware critic with noisy-step rewards. Trains a CLIP-based reward predictor on noisy latents and uses its per-step signal to compute advantage estimates for policy-gradient updates of the reverse diffusion kernel.

Result: Achieves better or comparable forgetting to strong baselines across multiple concepts while maintaining image quality and benign prompt fidelity. Ablations show per-step critics and noisy-conditioned rewards are key to stability and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The RL framework is simple to implement, supports off-policy reuse, and plugs into standard text-to-image backbones, providing an effective approach for diffusion unlearning with improved stability through per-step reward signals.

Abstract: Machine unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models aims to remove targeted concepts while preserving overall utility. Prior diffusion unlearning methods typically rely on supervised weight edits or global penalties; reinforcement-learning (RL) approaches, while flexible, often optimize sparse end-of-trajectory rewards, yielding high-variance updates and weak credit assignment. We present a general RL framework for diffusion unlearning that treats denoising as a sequential decision process and introduces a timestep-aware critic with noisy-step rewards. Concretely, we train a CLIP-based reward predictor on noisy latents and use its per-step signal to compute advantage estimates for policy-gradient updates of the reverse diffusion kernel. Our algorithm is simple to implement, supports off-policy reuse, and plugs into standard text-to-image backbones. Across multiple concepts, the method achieves better or comparable forgetting to strong baselines while maintaining image quality and benign prompt fidelity; ablations show that (i) per-step critics and (ii) noisy-conditioned rewards are key to stability and effectiveness. We release code and evaluation scripts to facilitate reproducibility and future research on RL-based diffusion unlearning.

Motivation: Classical information theory (Shannon information, Kolmogorov complexity) fails to capture useful information for computationally bounded observers, leading to paradoxes where deterministic transformations can't increase information, information is order-independent, and likelihood modeling is just distribution matching. These contradict modern machine learning practice where data transformations, ordering, and modeling create valuable learnable content.

Method: Introduces "epiplexity" as a formalization that captures structural content in data while excluding time-bounded entropy (random unpredictable content like pseudorandom generators). Develops practical procedures to estimate epiplexity and demonstrates how it addresses the three paradoxes.

Result: Epiplexity captures differences across data sources, tracks with downstream performance, and highlights dataset interventions that improve out-of-distribution generalization. Shows how information can be created with computation, depends on data ordering, and how likelihood modeling can produce more complex programs than the original data-generating process.

Conclusion: Epiplexity provides a theoretical foundation for data selection, guiding how to select, generate, or transform data for learning systems, in contrast to traditional model selection principles. It bridges the gap between classical information theory and practical machine learning.

Abstract: Can we learn more from data than existed in the generating process itself? Can new and useful information be constructed from merely applying deterministic transformations to existing data? Can the learnable content in data be evaluated without considering a downstream task? On these questions, Shannon information and Kolmogorov complexity come up nearly empty-handed, in part because they assume observers with unlimited computational capacity and fail to target the useful information content. In this work, we identify and exemplify three seeming paradoxes in information theory: (1) information cannot be increased by deterministic transformations; (2) information is independent of the order of data; (3) likelihood modeling is merely distribution matching. To shed light on the tension between these results and modern practice, and to quantify the value of data, we introduce epiplexity, a formalization of information capturing what computationally bounded observers can learn from data. Epiplexity captures the structural content in data while excluding time-bounded entropy, the random unpredictable content exemplified by pseudorandom number generators and chaotic dynamical systems. With these concepts, we demonstrate how information can be created with computation, how it depends on the ordering of the data, and how likelihood modeling can produce more complex programs than present in the data generating process itself. We also present practical procedures to estimate epiplexity which we show capture differences across data sources, track with downstream performance, and highlight dataset interventions that improve out-of-distribution generalization. In contrast to principles of model selection, epiplexity provides a theoretical foundation for data selection, guiding how to select, generate, or transform data for learning systems.

*Pinzhen Chen,Libo Xu,Boyang Pan,Jing Li,Yuting Wang,Ran Xiong,Xiaoli Gou,Long Qing,Wenjing Hou,Nan-jie Gong,Wei Chen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Deep learning superresolution improves subjective image quality in 7T knee MRI but doesn't enhance diagnostic accuracy compared to standard low-resolution imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether deep learning superresolution can enhance musculoskeletal MR image quality and diagnostic performance in knee imaging at 7T, comparing it with standard low-resolution and high-resolution sequences.

Method: Prospective study with 42 participants undergoing 7T knee MRI with low-resolution (0.8×0.8×2 mm³) and high-resolution (0.4×0.4×2 mm³) sequences. Superresolution images were generated from low-resolution data using a Hybrid Attention Transformer model. Three radiologists assessed image quality, anatomic conspicuity, and pathology detection, with arthroscopy as reference in 10 cases.

Result: Superresolution images showed higher overall quality than low-resolution (median score 5 vs 4) and lower noise than high-resolution (5 vs 4). Visibility of cartilage, menisci, and ligaments was superior in both superresolution and high-resolution compared to low-resolution. However, detection rates and diagnostic performance (sensitivity, specificity, AUC) for intra-articular pathology were similar across all image types.

Conclusion: Deep learning superresolution improves subjective image quality in 7T knee MRI but does not increase diagnostic accuracy compared with standard low-resolution imaging, suggesting limited clinical value for diagnostic enhancement despite improved visual quality.

Abstract: Background: Deep learning superresolution (SR) may enhance musculoskeletal MR image quality, but its diagnostic value in knee imaging at 7T is unclear. Objectives: To compare image quality and diagnostic performance of SR, low-resolution (LR), and high-resolution (HR) 7T knee MRI. Methods: In this prospective study, 42 participants underwent 7T knee MRI with LR (0.8*0.8*2 mm3) and HR (0.4*0.4*2 mm3) sequences. SR images were generated from LR data using a Hybrid Attention Transformer model. Three radiologists assessed image quality, anatomic conspicuity, and detection of knee pathologies. Arthroscopy served as reference in 10 cases. Results: SR images showed higher overall quality than LR (median score 5 vs 4, P<.001) and lower noise than HR (5 vs 4, P<.001). Visibility of cartilage, menisci, and ligaments was superior in SR and HR compared to LR (P<.001). Detection rates and diagnostic performance (sensitivity, specificity, AUC) for intra-articular pathology were similar across image types (P>=.095). Conclusions: Deep learning superresolution improved subjective image quality in 7T knee MRI but did not increase diagnostic accuracy compared with standard LR imaging.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and compare different binarization methods for medical image retrieval, aiming to find the most effective approach that balances accuracy, storage efficiency, and computational requirements for practical applications like device inventory management.

Method: Evaluated four binarization methods (LSH, ITQ, KSH, SDH) on ODIR dataset using deep feature embeddings, comparing their performance with different bit lengths and benchmarking against prior studies.

Result: SDH achieved the best performance with 0.9184 mAP@100 using only 32-bit codes, outperforming other methods. Despite using significantly fewer bits than prior studies (32 vs 48-256 bits), SDH achieved competitive accuracy close to state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: SDH is the most effective binarization method among those tested, offering a practical balance of accuracy, storage efficiency, and computational requirements for medical image retrieval applications.

Abstract: In this study, we evaluated four binarization methods. Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH), Iterative Quantization (ITQ), Kernel-based Supervised Hashing (KSH), and Supervised Discrete Hashing (SDH) on the ODIR dataset using deep feature embeddings. Experimental results show that SDH achieved the best performance, with an mAP@100 of 0.9184 using only 32-bit codes, outperforming LSH, ITQ, and KSH. Compared with prior studies, our method proved highly competitive: Fang et al. reported 0.7528 (Fundus-iSee, 48 bits) and 0.8856 (ASOCT-Cataract, 48 bits), while Wijesinghe et al. achieved 94.01 (KVASIR, 256 bits). Despite using significantly fewer bits, our SDH-based framework reached retrieval accuracy close to the state-of-the-art. These findings demonstrate that SDH is the most effective approach among those tested, offering a practical balance of accuracy, storage, and efficiency for medical image retrieval and device inventory management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Energy-Based Models (EBMs) are well-suited for inverse problems due to their interpretable energy landscapes and compositional structure, but historically suffer from high computational costs and training instability. The authors aim to overcome these limitations by leveraging the strengths of pre-trained diffusion models.

Method: 1) Fast distillation strategy to transfer strengths of pre-trained diffusion models into multi-scale EBMs; 2) Annealed Langevin Posterior Sampling (ALPS) algorithm for MAP, MMSE, and uncertainty estimation; 3) Uses annealing on static posterior distributions rather than complex guidance strategies for latent variables.

Result: Experiments on image inpainting and MRI reconstruction show the method matches or surpasses diffusion-based baselines in both accuracy and efficiency, while also supporting MAP recovery. The framework offers scalable and principled solutions for inverse problems.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a scalable and principled solution for inverse problems in imaging, with potential for practical deployment in scientific and clinical settings. ALPS combines the efficiency of diffusion models with the interpretability and compositionality of EBMs.

Abstract: Solving inverse problems in imaging requires models that support efficient inference, uncertainty quantification, and principled probabilistic reasoning. Energy-Based Models (EBMs), with their interpretable energy landscapes and compositional structure, are well-suited for this task but have historically suffered from high computational costs and training instability. To overcome the historical shortcomings of EBMs, we introduce a fast distillation strategy to transfer the strengths of pre-trained diffusion models into multi-scale EBMs. These distilled EBMs enable efficient sampling and preserve the interpretability and compositionality inherent to potential-based frameworks. Leveraging EBM compositionality, we propose Annealed Langevin Posterior Sampling (ALPS) algorithm for Maximum-A-Posteriori (MAP), Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE), and uncertainty estimates for inverse problems in imaging. Unlike diffusion models that use complex guidance strategies for latent variables, we perform annealing on static posterior distributions that are well-defined and composable. Experiments on image inpainting and MRI reconstruction demonstrate that our method matches or surpasses diffusion-based baselines in both accuracy and efficiency, while also supporting MAP recovery. Overall, our framework offers a scalable and principled solution for inverse problems in imaging, with potential for practical deployment in scientific and clinical settings. ALPS code is available at the GitHub repository \href{https://github.com/JyoChand/ALPS}{ALPS}.

Abstract: Accurate and automated lesion segmentation in Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography (PET/CT) imaging is essential for cancer diagnosis and therapy planning. This paper presents a Swin Transformer UNet 3D (SwinUNet3D) framework for lesion segmentation in Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography (FDG-PET/CT) scans. By combining shifted window self-attention with U-Net style skip connections, the model captures both global context and fine anatomical detail.

Results show that SwinUNet3D achieves a Dice score of 0.88 and IoU of 0.78, surpassing 3D U-Net (Dice 0.48, IoU 0.32) while also delivering faster inference times. Qualitative analysis demonstrates improved detection of small and irregular lesions, reduced false positives, and more accurate PET/CT fusion. While the framework is currently limited to FDG scans and trained under modest GPU resources, it establishes a strong foundation for future multi-tracer, multi-center evaluations and benchmarking against other transformer-based architectures.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: DiT-JSCC is a new generative joint source-channel coding method that uses a semantics-detail dual-branch encoder with a diffusion transformer decoder to achieve better semantic consistency and visual quality in extreme wireless conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative JSCC methods using diffusion models often produce visually realistic results but lack semantic consistency due to a mismatch between reconstruction-oriented encoders and generative decoders that lack explicit semantic discriminability.

Method: Proposes DiT-JSCC with: 1) semantics-detail dual-branch encoder that aligns with coarse-to-fine conditional DiT decoder, 2) training-free adaptive bandwidth allocation strategy inspired by Kolmogorov complexity to improve transmission efficiency.

Result: Extensive experiments show DiT-JSCC consistently outperforms existing JSCC methods in both semantic consistency and visual quality, particularly in extreme channel conditions (ultra-low bandwidth, low SNR).

Conclusion: DiT-JSCC provides a novel GJSCC backbone that jointly learns semantics-prioritized representation encoding with diffusion transformer decoding, redefining information value in generative decoding era and promoting future GJSCC research.

Abstract: Generative joint source-channel coding (GJSCC) has emerged as a new Deep JSCC paradigm for achieving high-fidelity and robust image transmission under extreme wireless channel conditions, such as ultra-low bandwidth and low signal-to-noise ratio. Recent studies commonly adopt diffusion models as generative decoders, but they frequently produce visually realistic results with limited semantic consistency. This limitation stems from a fundamental mismatch between reconstruction-oriented JSCC encoders and generative decoders, as the former lack explicit semantic discriminability and fail to provide reliable conditional cues. In this paper, we propose DiT-JSCC, a novel GJSCC backbone that can jointly learn a semantics-prioritized representation encoder and a diffusion transformer (DiT) based generative decoder, our open-source project aims to promote the future research in GJSCC. Specifically, we design a semantics-detail dual-branch encoder that aligns naturally with a coarse-to-fine conditional DiT decoder, prioritizing semantic consistency under extreme channel conditions. Moreover, a training-free adaptive bandwidth allocation strategy inspired by Kolmogorov complexity is introduced to further improve the transmission efficiency, thereby indeed redefining the notion of information value in the era of generative decoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiT-JSCC consistently outperforms existing JSCC methods in both semantic consistency and visual quality, particularly in extreme regimes.

### [130] [Breaking Rank - A Novel Unscented Kalman Filter for Parameter Estimations of a Lumped-Parameter Cardiovascular Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02390)
*Alex Thornton,Ian Halliday,Harry Saxton,Xu Xu*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Modified UKF achieves near-complete parameter identifiability for cardiovascular models, overcoming rank deficiency issues that traditionally limited parameter estimation to only influential subsets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional UKF suffers from rank deficiency when applied to parameter estimation in complex cardiovascular models, forcing researchers to fix non-influential parameters and estimate only optimal subsets. This limits clinical utility for comprehensive parameter identification.

Method: Modified unscented Kalman filter (UKF) with algorithmic changes that overcome rank deficiency problems. The modifications leverage the fact that for parameter estimation (unlike state tracking), the constraint of updating control at every time step no longer applies.

Result: Modified UKF achieves excellent robustness, recovering almost all 10 parameters with over 98% accuracy in over 90% of cases, even under severe noise, challenging pathophysiology, and without prior parameter distribution knowledge. Significant improvement over original UKF implementation.

Conclusion: The modified UKF transforms parameter estimation capability for complex nonlinear cardiovascular models, enabling near-complete practical identifiability of all parameters (including minimally influential ones) where traditional methods fail due to rank deficiency.

Abstract: We make modifications to the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) which bestow almost complete practical identifiability upon a lumped-parameter cardiovascular model with 10 parameters and 4 output observables - a highly non-linear, stiff problem of clinical significance. The modifications overcome the challenging problems of rank deficiency when applying the UKF to parameter estimation. Rank deficiency usually means only a small subset of parameters can be estimated. Traditionally, pragmatic compromises are made, such as selecting an optimal subset of parameters for estimation and fixing non-influential parameters. Kalman filters are typically used for dynamical state tracking, to facilitate the control u at every time step. However, for the purpose of parameter estimation, this constraint no longer applies. Our modification has transformed the utility of UKF for the parameter estimation purpose, including minimally influential parameters, with excellent robustness (i.e., under severe noise corruption, challenging patho-physiology, and no prior knowledge of parameter distributions). The modified UKF algorithm is robust in recovering almost all parameters to over 98% accuracy, over 90% of the time, with a challenging target data set of 50, 10-parameter samples. We compare this to the original implementation of the UKF algorithm for parameter estimation and demonstrate a significant improvement.

### [131] [Weights on finite fields and failures of the MacWilliams identities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02608)
*Jay A. Wood*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper discusses how certain weight enumerators on finite fields behave differently from Hamming weight enumerators - while Hamming weight enumerators of dual codes are mutually determined, other weight enumerators can show different behavior where codes with same weight enumerator have duals with different weight enumerators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the contrasting behavior between Hamming weight enumerators and other weight enumerators on finite fields regarding their relationship with dual codes.

Method: Theoretical analysis comparing the properties of Hamming weight enumerators (which satisfy MacWilliams' theorem) with a wide class of other weight enumerators that exhibit opposite behavior.

Result: Identified that while Hamming weight enumerators of linear codes and their duals completely determine each other, there exists a broad class of weight enumerators where codes can have identical weight enumerators but their dual codes have different weight enumerators.

Conclusion: The relationship between weight enumerators and their dual codes is not universal - Hamming weight enumerators have special properties not shared by many other weight enumerators on finite fields.

Abstract: In the 1960s, MacWilliams proved that the Hamming weight enumerator of a linear code over a finite field completely determines, and is determined by, the Hamming weight enumerator of its dual code. In particular, if two linear codes have the same Hamming weight enumerator, then their dual codes have the same Hamming weight enumerator.
  In contrast, there is a wide class of weights on finite fields whose weight enumerators have the opposite behavior: there exist two linear codes having the same weight enumerator, but their dual codes have different weight enumerators.

TL;DR: Characterizes optimal rate-distortion tradeoff for joint communication and state reconstruction in fading Gaussian channels with noncausal state information at transmitter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Examine the fundamental limits of simultaneously communicating a message and reconstructing channel state information when the transmitter has noncausal knowledge of interference state, which is relevant for systems requiring both reliable communication and accurate channel estimation.

Method: Analyze fading Gaussian channel model with additive state interference, where state is i.i.d. Gaussian sequence known noncausally at transmitter, fading coefficient known perfectly at both ends, and receiver must decode message while reconstructing state under common reconstruction constraint.

Result: Complete characterization of optimal rate-distortion tradeoff region for this setting, with analytical results validated through numerical examples illustrating rate-distortion and power-distortion tradeoffs.

Conclusion: Establishes fundamental performance limits for joint communication and state reconstruction in fading channels with noncausal state information, providing theoretical framework for systems requiring simultaneous message transmission and channel state estimation.

Abstract: The task of jointly communicating a message and reconstructing a common estimate of the channel state is examined for a fading Gaussian model with additive state interference. The state is an independent and identically distributed Gaussian sequence known noncausally at the transmitter, and the instantaneous fading coefficient is perfectly known at both the transmitter and the receiver. The receiver is required to decode the transmitted message and, in addition, reconstruct the state under a common reconstruction constraint ensuring that its estimate coincides with that at the transmitter. A complete characterization of the optimal rate distortion tradeoff region for this setting is the main result of our work. The analytical results are also validated through numerical examples illustrating the rate distortion and power distortion tradeoffs.

*Jianhang Zhu,Tsung-Hui Chang,Liyao Xiang,Kaiming Shen*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Proposes a hybrid approach combining deep unfolding networks with FastFP optimization for efficient weighted-sum-rates beamforming in MIMO networks, addressing computational challenges of conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional beamforming methods (FP and WMMSE) are computationally demanding due to large matrix inversions and Lagrange multiplier tuning. While reduced WMMSE works for single cell and FastFP eliminates these issues for multicell, FastFP suffers from difficult stepsize optimization.

Method: Integrates deep unfolding network into FastFP algorithm for stepsize optimization, creating a mixed learning-based and optimization-based approach for weighted-sum-rates beamforming in MIMO wireless networks.

Result: Numerical experiments show the proposed method is much more efficient than learning methods based on the WMMSE algorithm.

Conclusion: The hybrid deep unfolding + FastFP approach provides an efficient solution to multicell MIMO beamforming by addressing the stepsize optimization challenge while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: This work proposes a mixed learning-based and optimization-based approach to the weighted-sum-rates beamforming problem in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless network. The conventional methods, i.e., the fractional programming (FP) method and the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm, can be computationally demanding for two reasons: (i) they require inverting a sequence of matrices whose sizes are proportional to the number of antennas; (ii) they require tuning a set of Lagrange multipliers to account for the power constraints. The recently proposed method called the reduced WMMSE addresses the above two issues for a single cell. In contrast, for the multicell case, another recent method called the FastFP eliminates the large matrix inversion and the Lagrange multipliers by using an improved FP technique, but the update stepsize in the FastFP can be difficult to decide. As such, we propose integrating the deep unfolding network into the FastFP for the stepsize optimization. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method is much more efficient than the learning method based on the WMMSE algorithm.

### [134] [Context-aware Privacy Bounds for Linear Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02855)
*Heng Zhao,Sara Saeidian,Tobias J. Oechtering*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper proposes a context-aware privacy analysis for linear queries using pointwise maximal leakage (PML) instead of standard differential privacy (DP), showing that DP's distribution-agnostic approach often adds excessive noise. By incorporating prior knowledge about data distributions, the authors derive tighter privacy bounds that reduce noise requirements while maintaining privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard differential privacy (DP) uses a context-free, distribution-agnostic definition that often mandates excessive noise for linear queries. The authors aim to develop a more efficient privacy mechanism by incorporating knowledge about the data-generating distribution to reduce noise while maintaining privacy guarantees.

Method: The authors revisit privacy analysis through pointwise maximal leakage (PML) and incorporate an assumption about the prior distribution by lower-bounding the probability of any single record belonging to any specific class. They derive a tight, context-aware leakage bound for general linear queries and prove it's strictly tighter than standard DP guarantees.

Result: The derived context-aware bound is strictly tighter than standard DP guarantees and converges to DP as the probability lower bound approaches zero. Numerical evaluations show that exploiting prior knowledge reduces required noise scale while maintaining privacy.

Conclusion: By incorporating distributional knowledge through PML analysis, privacy mechanisms for linear queries can achieve the same privacy guarantees with significantly less noise compared to standard differential privacy approaches.

Abstract: Linear queries, as the basis of broad analysis tasks, are often released through privacy mechanisms based on differential privacy (DP), the most popular framework for privacy protection. However, DP adopts a context-free definition that operates independently of the data-generating distribution. In this paper, we revisit the privacy analysis of the Laplace mechanism through the lens of pointwise maximal leakage (PML). We demonstrate that the distribution-agnostic definition of the DP framework often mandates excessive noise. To address this, we incorporate an assumption about the prior distribution by lower-bounding the probability of any single record belonging to any specific class. With this assumption, we derive a tight, context-aware leakage bound for general linear queries, and prove that our derived bound is strictly tighter than the standard DP guarantee and converges to the DP guarantee as this probability lower bound approaches zero. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that by exploiting this prior knowledge, the required noise scale can be reduced while maintaining privacy guarantees.

Motivation: To systematically study how different isomorphisms (dualities) between finite abelian groups and their character groups affect the definition and properties of dual codes for additive codes over these groups.

Method: Analyze properties of dualities between finite abelian groups and their character groups, then apply these dualities to define and study dual codes of additive codes over these groups.

Result: Develops theoretical framework for understanding how different duality choices impact dual code properties, continuing and extending classical work by Delsarte and more recent contributions by Dougherty and collaborators.

Conclusion: The choice of duality isomorphism significantly influences dual code properties, and systematic study of these dualities provides deeper understanding of additive code theory over finite abelian groups.

Abstract: The choice of an isomorphism, a duality, between a finite abelian group $A$ and its character group allows one to define dual codes of additive codes over $A$. Properties of dualities and dual codes are studied, continuing work of Delsarte from 1973 and more recent work of Dougherty and his collaborators.

*Anuj Kumar Bhagat,Ritumoni Sarma*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper proves that the minimum distance of the Euclidean dual of cyclic codes generated by nth cyclotomic polynomials is 2^ω(n), confirming a previous conjecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors previously conjectured that the minimum distance of the Euclidean dual of cyclic codes generated by nth cyclotomic polynomials has a specific form (2^ω(n)), and this paper aims to prove this conjecture.

Method: The authors use algebraic coding theory and cyclotomic polynomial properties to analyze cyclic codes over finite fields. They work with the Euclidean dual of cyclic codes generated by nth cyclotomic polynomials Q_n(x) over 𝔽_q, where n is coprime to q.

Result: The main result proves that the minimum distance of the Euclidean dual code 𝒞_n^⊥ is exactly 2^ω(n), where ω(n) is the number of distinct prime factors of n. This confirms their earlier conjecture.

Conclusion: The paper successfully determines the minimum distance of the Euclidean dual of cyclic codes generated by cyclotomic polynomials, providing a complete solution to the problem and confirming their previous conjecture.

Abstract: In this article, we determine the minimum distance of the Euclidean dual of the cyclic code $\mathcal{C}_n$ generated by the $n$th cyclotomic polynomial $Q_n(x)$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$, for every positive integer $n$ co-prime to $q$. In particular, we prove that the minimum distance of $\mathcal{C}_{n}^{\perp}$ is a function of $n$, namely $2^{ω(n)}$. This was precisely the conjecture posed by us in \cite{BHAGAT2025}.

TL;DR: The paper solves an open problem about minimum individual key rates for secure linear aggregation, showing not all users need keys and characterizing optimal rate regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address an open problem posed by Yuan-Sun [ISIT 2025] about determining the minimum individual key rate required in vector linear secure aggregation, where a server computes one linear function without learning another.

Method: Characterize a new achievable polyhedral region for rate tuples (R₁,...,R_K) with vertices determined by binary rate assignments based on subsets I ⊆ [K] satisfying a rank-increment condition: rank([F_I;G_I]) = rank(F_I) + N.

Result: The achievable region strictly enlarges the best-known region by showing not every user needs a key. Converse analysis demonstrates optimality when minimizing the number of users holding keys.

Conclusion: The paper provides fundamental insights into secure aggregation key requirements, showing key distribution can be sparse while maintaining security, with optimal characterization for minimizing key-holding users.

Abstract: We provide new insights into an open problem recently posed by Yuan-Sun [ISIT 2025], concerning the minimum individual key rate required in the vector linear secure aggregation problem. Consider a distributed system with $K$ users, where each user $k\in [K]$ holds a data stream $W_k$ and an individual key $Z_k$. A server aims to compute a linear function $\mathbf{F}[W_1;\ldots;W_K]$ without learning any information about another linear function $\mathbf{G}[W_1;\ldots;W_K]$, where $[W_1;\ldots;W_K]$ denotes the row stack of $W_1,\ldots,W_K$. The open problem is to determine the minimum required length of $Z_k$, denoted as $R_k$, $k\in [K]$. In this paper, we characterize a new achievable region for the rate tuple $(R_1,\ldots,R_K)$. The region is polyhedral, with vertices characterized by a binary rate assignment $(R_1,\ldots,R_K) = (\mathbf{1}(1 \in \mathcal{I}),\ldots,\mathbf{1}(K\in \mathcal{I}))$, where $\mathcal{I}\subseteq [K]$ satisfies the \textit{rank-increment condition}: $\mathrm{rank}\left(\bigl[\mathbf{F}_{\mathcal{I}};\mathbf{G}_{\mathcal{I}}\bigr]\right) =\mathrm{rank}\bigl(\mathbf{F}_{\mathcal{I}}\bigr)+N$. Here, $\mathbf{F}_\mathcal{I}$ and $\mathbf{G}_\mathcal{I}$ are the submatrices formed by the columns indexed by $\mathcal{I}$. Our results uncover the novel fact that it is not necessary for every user to hold a key, thereby strictly enlarging the best-known achievable region in the literature. Furthermore, we provide a converse analysis to demonstrate its optimality when minimizing the number of users that hold keys.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A covert underwater communication system using hydrodynamic pressure fields from oscillating dipoles, achieving secure short-range networking with low probability of interception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for covert underwater swarm coordination that avoids detection, requiring a communication method with intrinsic Low Probability of Interception (LPI) properties for secure operations.

Method: Uses "Hydrodynamic Whispering" based on potential flow theory with oscillating dipole transmitters. Features BPSK modulation adapted for mechanical actuators, 24-sensor bio-inspired conformal array, and Spatio-Temporal Joint Processing with Spatial Matched-Field Beamforming to handle low SNR in turbulence.

Result: System achieves ~13.8 dB array gain and maintains near-zero Bit Error Rate within effective range, validating feasibility of using localized hydrodynamic pressure fluctuations for reliable secure communication.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that hydrodynamic pressure fields can enable reliable and secure short-range underwater networking with intrinsic LPI properties, suitable for covert swarm coordination.

Abstract: To address the imperative for covert underwater swarm coordination, this paper introduces "Hydrodynamic Whispering," a near-field silent communication paradigm utilizing Artificial Lateral Line (ALL) arrays. Grounded in potential flow theory, we model the transmitter as an oscillating dipole source. The resulting pressure field exhibits steep nearfield attenuation (scaling with 1/r^2, naturally delimiting a secure "communication bubble" with intrinsic Low Probability of Interception (LPI) properties. We propose a transceiver architecture featuring a Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) modulation scheme adapted for mechanical actuator inertia, coupled with a bio-inspired 24-sensor conformal array. To mitigate low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) in turbulent environments,a Spatio-Temporal Joint Processing framework incorporating Spatial Matched-Field Beamforming is developed. Simulation results demonstrate that the system achieves an array gain of approximately 13.8 dB and maintains a near-zero Bit Error Rate (BER) within the effective range. This study validates the feasibility of utilizing localized hydrodynamic pressure fluctuations for reliable and secure short-range underwater networking.

*Amir Hossein Fahim Raouf,İsmail Güvenç*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A measurement-based framework using tethered UAV to characterize altitude-dependent spectral behavior across 89MHz-6GHz, with models for power, entropy, and sparsity showing multidimensional altitude transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current spectrum models focus primarily on received power or threshold-based occupancy, lacking characterization of multidimensional altitude-dependent spectral structure needed for spectrum-aware UAV sensing and band selection.

Method: Multi-year spectrum measurement campaign using tethered Helikite UAV in outdoor urban environment; extraction of three altitude-dependent metrics (band-average power, spectral entropy, spectral sparsity); development of Altitude-Dependent Spectral Structure Model (ADSSM) using differential equations for power/entropy and logistic function for sparsity.

Result: ADSSM achieves low RMSE and high R² across all bands and years; power transitions occur over narrow low-altitude regions while entropy and sparsity evolve over broader band-dependent ranges, revealing multidimensional altitude-dependent spectrum behavior.

Conclusion: The framework enables spectrum-aware UAV sensing and band selection by explicitly modeling altitude-dependent spectral structure transitions beyond conventional power-based models, demonstrating that altitude effects are inherently multidimensional.

Abstract: This paper presents a measurement-based framework for characterizing altitude-dependent spectral behavior of signals received by a tethered Helikite unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Using a multi-year spectrum measurement campaign in an outdoor urban environment, power spectral density snapshots are collected over the 89 MHz--6 GHz range. Three altitude-dependent spectral metrics are extracted: band-average power, spectral entropy, and spectral sparsity. We introduce the Altitude-Dependent Spectral Structure Model (ADSSM) to characterize the spectral power and entropy using first-order altitude-domain differential equations, and spectral sparsity using a logistic function, yielding closed-form expressions with physically consistent asymptotic behavior. The model is fitted to altitude-binned measurements from three annual campaigns at the AERPAW testbed across six licensed and unlicensed sub-6 GHz bands. Across all bands and years, the ADSSM achieves low root-mean-square error and high coefficients of determination. Results indicate that power transitions occur over narrow low-altitude regions, while entropy and sparsity evolve over broader, band-dependent altitude ranges, demonstrating that altitude-dependent spectrum behavior is inherently multidimensional. By explicitly modeling altitude-dependent transitions in spectral structure beyond received power, the proposed framework enables spectrum-aware UAV sensing and band selection decisions that are not achievable with conventional power- or threshold-based occupancy models.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Proposes an AI-native cross-module optimized physical layer framework with cooperative control agents for simultaneous optimization of uplink/downlink modules, breaking traditional inter-module barriers for end-to-end performance improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional physical layer designs suffer from inter-module information barriers that prevent end-to-end optimization. The paper aims to overcome these limitations by creating an AI-native framework that enables simultaneous optimization across global modules toward global objectives.

Method: 1) AI-native cross-module optimization framework for simultaneous optimization of uplink (joint source-channel coding with modulation) and downlink (modulation with precoding and detection) modules. 2) Three enhancement mechanisms: AI/ML-based cross-layer modulation with theoretical analysis, utility-oriented precoder construction, and modulation-based CSI feedback bypassing bit-level bottlenecks. 3) AI/ML control agents for model switching based on channel state.

Result: Simulation results demonstrate superiority in terms of BLER (Block Error Rate) and throughput. Extensive simulations use practical assumptions aligned with 3GPP requirements, providing valuable insights for future standardization.

Conclusion: The proposed AI-native framework successfully breaks traditional inter-module barriers, enabling end-to-end optimization and demonstrating performance improvements. The work provides a foundation for future standardization discussions in wireless communications.

Abstract: In this article, a framework of AI-native cross-module optimized physical layer with cooperative control agents is proposed, which involves optimization across global AI/ML modules of the physical layer with innovative design of multiple enhancement mechanisms and control strategies. Specifically, it achieves simultaneous optimization across global modules of uplink AI/ML-based joint source-channel coding with modulation, and downlink AI/ML-based modulation with precoding and corresponding data detection, reducing traditional inter-module information barriers to facilitate end-to-end optimization toward global objectives. Moreover, multiple enhancement mechanisms are also proposed, including i) an AI/ML-based cross-layer modulation approach with theoretical analysis for downlink transmission that breaks the isolation of inter-layer features to expand the solution space for determining improved constellation, ii) a utility-oriented precoder construction method that shifts the role of the AI/ML-based CSI feedback decoder from recovering the original CSI to directly generating precoding matrices aiming to improve end-to-end performance, and iii) incorporating modulation into AI/ML-based CSI feedback to bypass bit-level bottlenecks that introduce quantization errors, non-differentiable gradients, and limitations in constellation solution spaces. Furthermore, AI/ML based control agents for optimized transmission schemes are proposed that leverage AI/ML to perform model switching according to channel state, thereby enabling integrated control for global throughput optimization. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed solutions in terms of BLER and throughput. These extensive simulations employ more practical assumptions that are aligned with the requirements of the 3GPP, which hopefully provides valuable insights for future standardization discussions.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: An end-to-end framework for distributed radar-based human activity recognition using lightweight CNNs for local feature extraction and self-attention fusion, achieving 70.8% model complexity reduction with higher accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distributed radar sensors enable robust human activity recognition but face challenges in feature extraction from large datasets and transparent data fusion when scaling the number of coordinated nodes.

Method: End-to-end framework operating on raw radar data: each node uses lightweight 2D CNN for local feature extraction (480x dimensionality reduction), self-attention fusion block models inter-node relationships, and hybrid supervised contrastive loss improves feature separability.

Result: Reduces model complexity by 70.8% while achieving higher average accuracy than baseline approaches on real-world distributed UWB radar data, with reduced communication overhead and latency.

Conclusion: The framework enables transparent, efficient, and low-overhead distributed radar sensing with inherent interpretability through attention mechanisms quantifying each node's contribution.

Abstract: Distributed radar sensors enable robust human activity recognition. However, scaling the number of coordinated nodes introduces challenges in feature extraction from large datasets, and transparent data fusion. We propose an end-to-end framework that operates directly on raw radar data. Each radar node employs a lightweight 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract local features. A self-attention fusion block then models inter-node relationships and performs adaptive information fusion. Local feature extraction reduces the input dimensionality by up to 480x. This significantly lowers communication overhead and latency. The attention mechanism provides inherent interpretability by quantifying the contribution of each radar node. A hybrid supervised contrastive loss further improves feature separability, especially for fine-grained and imbalanced activity classes. Experiments on real-world distributed Ultra Wide Band (UWB) radar data demonstrate that the proposed method reduces model complexity by 70.8\%, while achieving higher average accuracy than baseline approaches. Overall, the framework enables transparent, efficient, and low-overhead distributed radar sensing.

### [142] [Study of Class-Incremental Radio Frequency Fingerprint Recognition Without Storing Exemplars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03063)
*Rundong Jiang,Jun Hu,Yunqi Song,Zhiyuan Xie,Shiyou Xu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Proposes an exemplar-free class-incremental learning framework for Radio Frequency Fingerprinting that uses pseudo-feature sampling from Gaussian Mixture Models instead of storing raw data, enabling continuous learning of new wireless devices without privacy concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wireless device proliferation requires robust authentication. RFF uses physical-layer impairments for identification but faces challenges: new devices continuously join systems, per-class training data is limited, and conventional static training with data replay is impractical due to growing class cardinality, storage costs, and privacy concerns.

Method: Freezes pretrained feature extractor backbone, trains only classifier with lightweight Adapter modules for task-specific adjustments. For each class, fits diagonal Gaussian Mixture Model to backbone features and samples pseudo-features to rehearse past classes without storing raw signals. Uses time-domain random-masking augmentation for few-shot robustness and multi-teacher distillation to compress stage-wise Adapters into single inference Adapter.

Result: Evaluated on large self-collected ADS-B datasets: backbone pretrained on 2,175 classes, incremental experiments on disjoint set of 669 classes with multiple rounds and step sizes. Consistently yields higher average accuracy and lower forgetting than baselines, while using substantially less storage and avoiding raw-data retention.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline provides a practical, low-storage solution for RFF deployment in resource- and privacy-constrained environments, offering reproducible framework for continuous learning of wireless device identities without storing sensitive raw data.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of wireless devices makes robust identity authentication essential. Radio Frequency Fingerprinting (RFF) exploits device-specific, hard-to-forge physical-layer impairments for identification, and is promising for IoT and unmanned systems. In practice, however, new devices continuously join deployed systems while per-class training data are limited. Conventional static training and naive replay of stored exemplars are impractical due to growing class cardinality, storage cost, and privacy concerns.
  We propose an exemplar-free class-incremental learning framework tailored to RFF recognition. Starting from a pretrained feature extractor, we freeze the backbone during incremental stages and train only a classifier together with lightweight Adapter modules that perform small task-specific feature adjustments. For each class we fit a diagonal Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to the backbone features and sample pseudo-features from these fitted distributions to rehearse past classes without storing raw signals. To improve robustness under few-shot conditions we introduce a time-domain random-masking augmentation and adopt a multi-teacher distillation scheme to compress stage-wise Adapters into a single inference Adapter, trading off accuracy and runtime efficiency.
  We evaluate the method on large, self-collected ADS-B datasets: the backbone is pretrained on 2,175 classes and incremental experiments are run on a disjoint set of 669 classes with multiple rounds and step sizes. Against several representative baselines, our approach consistently yields higher average accuracy and lower forgetting, while using substantially less storage and avoiding raw-data retention.
  The proposed pipeline is reproducible and provides a practical, low-storage solution for RFF deployment in resource- and privacy-constrained environments.

*Mohsen Kazemian,Jürgen Jasperneite*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Proposes CVAE4CP, a conditional variational autoencoder method for predicting OTFS channels in high mobility scenarios, outperforming baselines in NMSE especially at high Doppler frequencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In high mobility OTFS systems, rapid channel variations due to Doppler spread and time-varying multipath cause fast channel decorrelation, making conventional pilot-based estimation prone to outdated CSI and excessive overhead. Reliable channel prediction is essential for robust detection and decoding.

Method: Conditional Variational Autoencoder for Channel Prediction (CVAE4CP) learns the conditional distribution of OTFS delay-Doppler channel coefficients given physical system and mobility parameters. It incorporates these parameters as conditioning information to predict future channel coefficients before actual realization, while accounting for channel uncertainty through low-dimensional latent representation.

Result: Extensive simulations under high mobility conditions show CVAE4CP consistently outperforms competing learning-based baselines in normalized mean squared error (NMSE), particularly at high Doppler frequencies and extended prediction horizons.

Conclusion: The proposed CVAE4CP method is effective and robust for channel prediction in rapidly time-varying OTFS systems, addressing the challenges of high mobility scenarios through conditional distribution learning and uncertainty modeling.

Abstract: This paper proposes a machine learning (ML) based method for channel prediction in high mobility orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) channels. In these scenarios, rapid variations caused by Doppler spread and time varying multipath propagation lead to fast channel decorrelation, making conventional pilot based channel estimation methods prone to outdated channel state information (CSI) and excessive overhead. Therefore, reliable channel prediction methods become essential to support robust detection and decoding in OTFS systems. In this paper, we propose conditional variational autoencoder for channel prediction (CVAE4CP) method, which learns the conditional distribution of OTFS delay Doppler channel coefficients given physical system and mobility parameters. By incorporating these parameters as conditioning information, the proposed method enables the prediction of future channel coefficients before their actual realization, while accounting for inherent channel uncertainty through a low dimensional latent representation. The proposed framework is evaluated through extensive simulations under high mobility conditions. Numerical results demonstrate that CVAE4CP consistently outperforms a competing learning based baseline in terms of normalized mean squared error (NMSE), particularly at high Doppler frequencies and extended prediction horizons. These results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach for channel prediction in rapidly time varying OTFS systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need efficient flow allocation in 5G User Plane Functions to handle stochastic flow arrivals with delay and energy constraints, where traditional methods may not adapt well to unknown dynamics.

Method: Post-decision state (PDS) based value iteration algorithm that separates action-controlled dynamics from exogenous factors, enabling efficient adaptive flow allocation without statistical knowledge of exogenous variables.

Result: Simulation shows faster convergence and lower long-term cost compared to standard Q-learning, demonstrating effectiveness for wireless network resource allocation.

Conclusion: PDS-based RL is effective for delay- and energy-aware flow allocation in 5G UPFs, offering structural advantages over conventional RL methods.

Abstract: We develop a structure-aware reinforcement learning (RL) approach for delay- and energy-aware flow allocation in 5G User Plane Functions (UPFs). We consider a dynamic system with $K$ heterogeneous UPFs of varying capacities that handle stochastic arrivals of $M$ flow types, each with distinct rate requirements. We model the system as a Markov decision process (MDP) to capture the stochastic nature of flow arrivals and departures (possibly unknown), as well as the impact of flow allocation in the system. To solve this problem, we propose a post-decision state (PDS) based value iteration algorithm that exploits the underlying structure of the MDP. By separating action-controlled dynamics from exogenous factors, PDS enables faster convergence and efficient adaptive flow allocation, even in the absence of statistical knowledge about exogenous variables. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method converges faster and achieves lower long-term cost than standard Q-learning, highlighting the effectiveness of PDS-based RL for resource allocation in wireless networks.

TL;DR: SE-LoRa modulation with SIC-based detector improves LoRa spectral efficiency by 445-1071% while maintaining error performance within 3dB of conventional LoRa.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRa modulation has limited spectral efficiency, especially at higher spreading factors. There's a need to improve spectral efficiency while maintaining acceptable error performance.

Method: Proposes SE-LoRa modulation with low-complexity SIC-based detector. Derives joint ML detection rule, then develops frequency-domain SIC detector with computational complexity similar to conventional LoRa detection.

Result: Spectral efficiency improvements: 445.45% (SF7), 1011.11% (SF9), 1071.88% (SF11). Error performance within 3dB of conventional LoRa at SER 10⁻³ in Rician channels.

Conclusion: SE-LoRa with SIC detector significantly enhances LoRa spectral efficiency while maintaining practical error performance and computational complexity.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a spectral-efficient LoRa (SE-LoRa) modulation scheme with a low complexity successive interference cancellation (SIC)-based detector. The proposed communication scheme significantly improves the spectral efficiency of LoRa modulation, while achieving an acceptable error performance compared to conventional LoRa modulation, especially in higher spreading factor (SF) settings. We derive the joint maximum likelihood (ML) detection rule for the SE-LoRa transmission scheme that turns out to be of high computational complexity. To overcome this issue, and by exploiting the frequency-domain characteristics of the dechirped SE-LoRa signal, we propose a low complexity SIC-based detector with a computation complexity at the order of conventional LoRa detection. By computer simulations, we show that the proposed SE-LoRa with low complexity SIC-based detector can improve the spectral efficiency of LoRa modulation up to $445.45\%$, $1011.11\%$, and $1071.88\%$ for SF values of $7$, $9$, and $11$, respectively, while maintaining the error performance within less than $3$ dB of conventional LoRa at symbol error rate (SER) of $10^{-3}$ in Rician channel conditions.

*Amir Hossein Fahim Raouf,İsmail Güvenc*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Altitude-dependent spectrum activity models can be transferred across years for downlink and shared-access bands but not for uplink bands, with a minimal-calibration method enabling low-cost model reuse in stable environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether spectrum activity models and measurements collected at different altitudes can be reliably transferred across different years, enabling more efficient spectrum management and reducing measurement costs.

Method: Developed a physics-informed stochastic-geometry model with three interpretable parameters (line-of-sight transition slope, transition altitude, effective activity constant). Analyzed aerial spectrum measurements from 2023-2025 across multiple sub-6 GHz bands. Evaluated a minimal-calibration method fixing transition altitude from reference year and estimating other parameters from only two altitude bins.

Result: Downlink and shared-access bands preserve persistent altitude structure stable across years, while uplink bands show weak altitude dependence dominated by activity dynamics. Minimal-calibration method provides accurate predictions for DL and CBRS bands but has reduced applicability for UL scenarios.

Conclusion: Geometry-driven altitude structure is transferable across years for DL and shared-access bands, enabling low-cost model reuse in stable environments, while UL bands require different modeling approaches due to activity-dominant interference patterns.

Abstract: This paper studies the transferability of altitude-dependent spectrum activity models and measurements across years. We introduce a physics-informed, mean-only stochastic-geometry model of aggregate interference to altitude-binned received power, yielding three interpretable parameters for a given band and campaign: 1) line-of-sight transition slope, 2) transition altitude, and 3) effective activity constant. Analysis of aerial spectrum measurements collected from 2023 to 2025 across multiple sub-6 GHz bands reveals that downlink (DL) and shared-access bands preserve a persistent geometry-driven altitude structure that is stable across years. In contrast, uplink (UL) bands exhibit weak altitude dependence with no identifiable transition, indicating that interference is dominated by activity dynamics rather than propagation geometry. To quantify the practical limits of model reuse, we evaluate a minimal-calibration method in which the transition altitude is fixed from a reference year and the remaining parameters are estimated from only two altitude bins in the target year. The results further indicate that the proposed approach provides accurate predictions for DL and CBRS bands, suggesting the feasibility of low-cost model transfer in stable environments, while highlighting the reduced applicability of mean-field models for UL scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding RL policies is crucial for aligning autonomous agents with human expectations, but existing textual explanations lack correctness guarantees and systematic evaluation methods.

Method: Uses LLMs to generate textual explanations, clustering to identify frequent conditions, converts them to transparent rules, and applies two refinement techniques to improve quality and reduce conflicts. Includes automatic predicate generator for semantic state information and expert knowledge integration.

Result: Framework addresses limitations of existing methods (Autonomous Policy Explanation), achieves satisfactory performance on certain tasks, enables systematic quantitative evaluation of textual explanations, and demonstrates industrial applicability in telecom use case.

Conclusion: The proposed XRL framework provides a systematic approach to generate, refine, and evaluate textual explanations, offering valuable insights for the XRL field while addressing correctness and evaluation challenges.

Abstract: Understanding a Reinforcement Learning (RL) policy is crucial for ensuring that autonomous agents behave according to human expectations. This goal can be achieved using Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL) techniques. Although textual explanations are easily understood by humans, ensuring their correctness remains a challenge, and evaluations in state-of-the-art remain limited. We present a novel XRL framework for generating textual explanations, converting them into a set of transparent rules, improving their quality, and evaluating them. Expert's knowledge can be incorporated into this framework, and an automatic predicate generator is also proposed to determine the semantic information of a state. Textual explanations are generated using a Large Language Model (LLM) and a clustering technique to identify frequent conditions. These conditions are then converted into rules to evaluate their properties, fidelity, and performance in the deployed environment. Two refinement techniques are proposed to improve the quality of explanations and reduce conflicting information. Experiments were conducted in three open-source environments to enable reproducibility, and in a telecom use case to evaluate the industrial applicability of the proposed XRL framework. This framework addresses the limitations of an existing method, Autonomous Policy Explanation, and the generated transparent rules can achieve satisfactory performance on certain tasks. This framework also enables a systematic and quantitative evaluation of textual explanations, providing valuable insights for the XRL field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents need efficient memory systems for long-term interactions in complex environments. Existing approaches either retain full interaction histories (causing redundancy) or use iterative reasoning (high token costs), creating a need for a balanced solution.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: 1) Semantic Structured Compression - entropy-aware filtering to distill interactions into compact, multi-view indexed memory units; 2) Recursive Memory Consolidation - asynchronous integration of related units into higher-level abstract representations; 3) Adaptive Query-Aware Retrieval - dynamic adjustment of retrieval scope based on query complexity.

Result: Outperforms baselines in accuracy, retrieval efficiency, and inference cost. Achieves average F1 improvement of 26.4% while reducing inference-time token consumption by up to 30-fold.

Conclusion: SimpleMem demonstrates superior balance between performance and efficiency for LLM agent memory systems through semantic lossless compression, offering practical benefits for long-term interactions in complex environments.

Abstract: To support reliable long-term interaction in complex environments, LLM agents require memory systems that efficiently manage historical experiences. Existing approaches either retain full interaction histories via passive context extension, leading to substantial redundancy, or rely on iterative reasoning to filter noise, incurring high token costs. To address this challenge, we introduce SimpleMem, an efficient memory framework based on semantic lossless compression. We propose a three-stage pipeline designed to maximize information density and token utilization: (1) \textit{Semantic Structured Compression}, which applies entropy-aware filtering to distill unstructured interactions into compact, multi-view indexed memory units; (2) \textit{Recursive Memory Consolidation}, an asynchronous process that integrates related units into higher-level abstract representations to reduce redundancy; and (3) \textit{Adaptive Query-Aware Retrieval}, which dynamically adjusts retrieval scope based on query complexity to construct precise context efficiently. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method consistently outperforms baseline approaches in accuracy, retrieval efficiency, and inference cost, achieving an average F1 improvement of 26.4% while reducing inference-time token consumption by up to 30-fold, demonstrating a superior balance between performance and efficiency.

Method: Orchestral defines a single universal representation for messages, tools, and LLM usage that works across providers, eliminating manual format translation. It uses automatic tool schema generation from Python type hints for type safety, and employs a synchronous execution model with streaming support for deterministic behavior and easy debugging.

Result: The framework provides a modular architecture that separates provider integration, tool execution, conversation orchestration, and user interfaces, enabling extensibility without architectural entanglement. It supports advanced agent capabilities including rich tool calling, context compaction, workspace sandboxing, user approval workflows, sub-agents, memory management, and MCP integration.

Conclusion: Orchestral offers a practical solution to the LLM agent framework fragmentation problem by providing a unified, type-safe interface that preserves simplicity while enabling portable, reliable agent systems across major LLM providers.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of LLM agent frameworks has forced developers to choose between vendor lock-in through provider-specific SDKs and complex multi-package ecosystems that obscure control flow and hinder reproducibility. Integrating tool calling across multiple LLM providers remains a core engineering challenge due to fragmented APIs, incompatible message formats, and inconsistent streaming and tool-calling behavior, making it difficult to build portable, reliable agent systems. We introduce Orchestral, a lightweight Python framework that provides a unified, type-safe interface for building LLM agents across major providers while preserving the simplicity required for scientific computing and production deployment. Orchestral defines a single universal representation for messages, tools, and LLM usage that operates seamlessly across providers, eliminating manual format translation and reducing framework-induced complexity. Automatic tool schema generation from Python type hints removes the need for handwritten descriptors while maintaining type safety across provider boundaries. A synchronous execution model with streaming support enables deterministic behavior, straightforward debugging, and real-time interaction without introducing server dependencies. The framework's modular architecture cleanly separates provider integration, tool execution, conversation orchestration, and user-facing interfaces, enabling extensibility without architectural entanglement. Orchestral supports advanced agent capabilities found in larger frameworks, including rich tool calling, context compaction, workspace sandboxing, user approval workflows, sub-agents, memory management, and MCP integration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite efficiency research, there's little work on practical deployment aspects like CPU utilization and thermal conditions for real-world on-device AI deployment. The paper aims to address key issues for deploying on-device models in real services.

Method: The researchers conducted extensive experiments focusing on two key issues: (1) on-device model selection and resource consumption analysis, and (2) domain adaptation capabilities. They created LiveChatBench - a manually constructed benchmark of 1,000 Korean-English parallel sentence pairs for live-stream chat translation. Experiments were conducted on five mobile devices.

Result: Experiments show that while serving diverse users requires careful consideration of constrained deployment settings and model selection, the proposed approach achieves performance comparable to commercial models like GPT-5.1 on the targeted live-stream chat translation task.

Conclusion: The findings provide meaningful insights for the on-device AI community, demonstrating that with proper model selection and consideration of deployment constraints, on-device models can achieve commercial-level performance for specific domain tasks like live-stream chat translation.

Abstract: Despite its efficiency, there has been little research on the practical aspects required for real-world deployment of on-device AI models, such as the device's CPU utilization and thermal conditions. In this paper, through extensive experiments, we investigate two key issues that must be addressed to deploy on-device models in real-world services: (i) the selection of on-device models and the resource consumption of each model, and (ii) the capability and potential of on-device models for domain adaptation. To this end, we focus on a task of translating live-stream chat messages and manually construct LiveChatBench, a benchmark consisting of 1,000 Korean-English parallel sentence pairs. Experiments on five mobile devices demonstrate that, although serving a large and heterogeneous user base requires careful consideration of highly constrained deployment settings and model selection, the proposed approach nevertheless achieves performance comparable to commercial models such as GPT-5.1 on the well-targeted task. We expect that our findings will provide meaningful insights to the on-device AI community.

### [151] [AWARE-US: Benchmark for Preference-Aware Resolution in Tool-Calling Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02643)
*Mehmet Kurmaz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-based methods for preference-aware query repair when database queries are infeasible, focusing on relaxing least important constraints based on inferred user preferences from dialogue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches to infeasible database queries either return "no results" or use ad hoc constraint relaxation that may violate user intent by discarding important constraints.

Method: Three LLM-based methods for inferring relative constraint importance from dialogue: (1) local weighting, (2) global one-shot weighting, and (3) pairwise ranking. Also introduces AWARE-US benchmark for persona-grounded queries.

Result: Local weighting achieves best preference alignment, while global weighting performs best on correct constraint relaxation.

Conclusion: Preference-aware query repair is a better approach than existing methods, with different LLM-based inference methods showing complementary strengths in handling infeasible database queries.

Abstract: Tool-calling conversational agents querying structured databases often face two linked failures: underspecification (missing constraints needed to run a precise query) and infeasibility (the fully specified query returns an empty set because no item satisfies all constraints). Existing work often responds with "no results" or relaxes constraints using ad hoc rules, which can violate user intent by discarding requirements the user cares about most. We frame infeasibility handling as a preference-aware query repair problem: when a query is unsatisfiable, the agent should relax the least important constraints to the user. We propose three LLM-based methods for inferring relative constraint importance from dialogue: (1) local weighting, (2) global one-shot weighting, and (3) pairwise ranking. Experiments show local weighting achieves the best preference alignment, while global weighting performs best on correct constraint relaxation. We also introduce AWARE-US, a benchmark of persona-grounded queries requiring agents to disambiguate requests via conversation and resolve infeasibility in a way consistent with persona-implied preferences.

*Hadi Partovi Aria,Zhe Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GTL-CIRL: A closed-loop framework that learns policies while mining Causal Graph Temporal Logic specifications, using robustness-shaped rewards and Gaussian Process Bayesian optimization for efficient learning in spatial-temporal decision-making tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard black-box reinforcement learning overlooks how local changes propagate through network structures in spatial-temporal decision-making tasks, limiting sample efficiency and interpretability. There's a need for methods that can capture causal relationships and provide verifiable behavior specifications.

Method: GTL-CIRL simultaneously learns policies and mines Causal Graph Temporal Logic specifications. It shapes rewards using robustness measures, collects counterexamples when effects fail, and employs Gaussian Process-driven Bayesian optimization to refine parameterized cause templates. The GP models capture spatial and temporal correlations in system dynamics.

Result: Case studies in gene regulatory networks and power networks demonstrate faster learning and clearer, verifiable behavior compared to standard RL baselines. The framework achieves improved sample efficiency and interpretability.

Conclusion: GTL-CIRL provides an effective closed-loop framework for spatial-temporal decision-making that combines policy learning with causal specification mining, offering both performance improvements and interpretable, verifiable behavior specifications.

Abstract: Decision-making tasks often unfold on graphs with spatial-temporal dynamics. Black-box reinforcement learning often overlooks how local changes spread through network structure, limiting sample efficiency and interpretability. We present GTL-CIRL, a closed-loop framework that simultaneously learns policies and mines Causal Graph Temporal Logic (Causal GTL) specifications. The method shapes rewards with robustness, collects counterexamples when effects fail, and uses Gaussian Process (GP) driven Bayesian optimization to refine parameterized cause templates. The GP models capture spatial and temporal correlations in the system dynamics, enabling efficient exploration of complex parameter spaces. Case studies in gene and power networks show faster learning and clearer, verifiable behavior compared to standard RL baselines.

*Dongyu Chen,Jian Ma,Xianpeng Zhang,Lei Zhang,Haonan Lu,Chen Chen,Chuangchuang Wang,Kai Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HAPO framework addresses prompt drift and interpretability issues in prompt optimization through hierarchical attribution and semantic-unit editing, outperforming existing methods on tasks like image QA and complex reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prompt optimization methods suffer from prompt drift (fixing new failures while breaking previously working tasks) and compromise interpretability when generating prompts from scratch. There's a need for automated/semi-automated optimization that reduces manual effort, improves performance, and maintains interpretability.

Method: Hierarchical Attribution Prompt Optimization (HAPO) framework with three innovations: (1) dynamic attribution mechanism targeting error patterns in training data and prompting history, (2) semantic-unit optimization for editing functional prompt segments, (3) multimodal-friendly progression supporting both end-to-end LLM and LLM-MLLM workflows.

Result: HAPO demonstrates enhanced optimization efficiency, outperforming comparable automated prompt optimization methods on tasks like single/multi-image QA (OCRV2) and complex task analysis (BBH).

Conclusion: HAPO establishes an extensible paradigm for scalable prompt engineering that addresses prompt drift and interpretability limitations while supporting multimodal applications.

Abstract: Optimization is fundamental across numerous disciplines, typically following an iterative process of refining an initial solution to enhance performance. This principle is equally critical in prompt engineering, where designing effective prompts for large language models constitutes a complex optimization challenge. A structured optimization approach requires automated or semi-automated procedures to develop improved prompts, thereby reducing manual effort, improving performance, and yielding an interpretable process. However, current prompt optimization methods often induce prompt drift, where new prompts fix prior failures but impair performance on previously successful tasks. Additionally, generating prompts from scratch can compromise interpretability. To address these limitations, this study proposes the Hierarchical Attribution Prompt Optimization (HAPO) framework, which introduces three innovations: (1) a dynamic attribution mechanism targeting error patterns in training data and prompting history, (2) semantic-unit optimization for editing functional prompt segments, and (3) multimodal-friendly progression supporting both end-to-end LLM and LLM-MLLM workflows. Applied in contexts like single/multi-image QA (e.g., OCRV2) and complex task analysis (e.g., BBH), HAPO demonstrates enhanced optimization efficiency, outperforming comparable automated prompt optimization methods and establishing an extensible paradigm for scalable prompt engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As conversational agents work with users over time, adapting to user preferences is crucial for building long-term relationships and improving collaboration quality.

Method: Introduces MultiSessionCollab benchmark and develops long-term collaborative agents with persistent memory that refines user preferences as interactions accumulate. Uses learning signals from user simulator behavior to train agents for better reflection and memory updates.

Result: Memory-equipped agents achieve higher task success rates, more efficient interactions, and reduced user effort. Human study confirms memory improves real-world user experience.

Conclusion: Memory is essential for agents to learn and adapt to user preferences over multiple sessions, significantly improving long-term collaboration quality and user experience.

Abstract: As conversational agents accumulate experience collaborating with users, adapting to user preferences is essential for fostering long-term relationships and improving collaboration quality over time. We introduce MultiSessionCollab, a benchmark that evaluates how well agents can learn user preferences and leverage them to improve collaboration quality throughout multiple sessions. To develop agents that succeed in this setting, we present long-term collaborative agents equipped with a memory that persists and refines user preference as interaction experience accumulates. Moreover, we demonstrate that learning signals can be derived from user simulator behavior in MultiSessionCollab to train agents to generate more comprehensive reflections and update their memory more effectively. Extensive experiments show that equipping agents with memory improves long-term collaboration, yielding higher task success rates, more efficient interactions, and reduced user effort. Finally, we conduct a human user study that demonstrates that memory helps improve user experience in real-world settings.

### [155] [Time-Scaling Is What Agents Need Now](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02714)
*Zhi Liu,Guangzhi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues for "Time-Scaling" - systematically extending AI agents' ability to unfold reasoning over time through architectural designs with extended temporal pathways, enabling deeper problem exploration and dynamic strategy adjustment without proportional parameter increases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early AI paradigms were separated (neural networks for perception, RL for decision-making, symbolic AI for reasoning), but are now converging into cognitive agents. While LLMs can generate fluent text, they lack robust semantic reasoning. Prompting techniques like CoT and ToT help but have limitations in search completeness and efficiency. Humans solve complex problems through temporalized sequential reasoning under cognitive constraints, highlighting the need for systematic temporal reasoning extension.

Method: Proposes "Time-Scaling" as an architectural design principle utilizing extended temporal pathways. This enables deeper problem space exploration, dynamic strategy adjustment, and enhanced metacognitive control. The approach parallels human sequential reasoning and focuses on explicit temporal reasoning management rather than just increasing static model parameters.

Result: The paper presents a conceptual framework rather than empirical results. It positions Time-Scaling as a critical frontier for enhancing deep reasoning and problem-solving in AI agents, suggesting it can overcome limitations of current prompting techniques while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Advancing intelligent agent capabilities requires placing Time-Scaling principles at the forefront, with explicit temporal reasoning management as foundational. This represents a key direction for developing AI systems with more robust semantic reasoning and problem-solving abilities that better emulate human cognitive processes under resource constraints.

Abstract: Early artificial intelligence paradigms exhibited separated cognitive functions: Neural Networks focused on "perception-representation," Reinforcement Learning on "decision-making-behavior," and Symbolic AI on "knowledge-reasoning." With Transformer-based large models and world models, these paradigms are converging into cognitive agents with closed-loop "perception-decision-action" capabilities.
  Humans solve complex problems under limited cognitive resources through temporalized sequential reasoning. Language relies on problem space search for deep semantic reasoning. While early large language models (LLMs) could generate fluent text, they lacked robust semantic reasoning capabilities. Prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) extended reasoning paths by making intermediate steps explicit. Recent models like DeepSeek-R1 enhanced performance through explicit reasoning trajectories. However, these methods have limitations in search completeness and efficiency.
  This highlights the need for "Time-Scaling"--the systematic extension and optimization of an agent's ability to unfold reasoning over time. Time-Scaling refers to architectural design utilizing extended temporal pathways, enabling deeper problem space exploration, dynamic strategy adjustment, and enhanced metacognitive control, paralleling human sequential reasoning under cognitive constraints. It represents a critical frontier for enhancing deep reasoning and problem-solving without proportional increases in static model parameters. Advancing intelligent agent capabilities requires placing Time-Scaling principles at the forefront, positioning explicit temporal reasoning management as foundational.

Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) from passive text generators to autonomous, goal-driven systems represents a fundamental shift in artificial intelligence. This chapter examines the emergence of agentic AI systems that integrate planning, memory, tool use, and iterative reasoning to operate autonomously in complex environments. We trace the architectural progression from statistical models to transformer-based systems, identifying capabilities that enable agentic behavior: long-range reasoning, contextual awareness, and adaptive decision-making. The chapter provides three contributions: (1) a synthesis of how LLM capabilities extend toward agency through reasoning-action-reflection loops; (2) an integrative framework describing core components perception, memory, planning, and tool execution that bridge LLMs with autonomous behavior; (3) a critical assessment of applications and persistent challenges in safety, alignment, reliability, and sustainability. Unlike existing surveys, we focus on the architectural transition from language understanding to autonomous action, emphasizing the technical gaps that must be resolved before deployment. We identify critical research priorities, including verifiable planning, scalable multi-agent coordination, persistent memory architectures, and governance frameworks. Responsible advancement requires simultaneous progress in technical robustness, interpretability, and ethical safeguards to realize potential while mitigating risks of misalignment and unintended consequences.

*Masum Hasan,Junjie Zhao,Ehsan Hoque*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HAL framework aligns LLMs to conversational human-likeness using interpretable, data-driven rewards derived from contrastive dialogue data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conversational human-likeness is crucial for human-AI interaction but difficult to define, measure, and optimize, with current improvements driven by scale rather than targeted alignment.

Method: Derives explicit conversational traits from contrastive dialogue data, combines them into a compact scalar score, and uses this as a transparent reward signal for alignment with standard preference optimization methods.

Result: Aligned models of varying sizes without affecting overall performance; in human evaluations, HAL-aligned models are more frequently perceived as human-like in conversation.

Conclusion: HAL demonstrates how soft, qualitative properties of language can be made measurable and aligned in an interpretable and explainable way, enabling inspection of alignment behavior and diagnosis of unintended effects.

Abstract: Conversational human-likeness plays a central role in human-AI interaction, yet it has remained difficult to define, measure, and optimize. As a result, improvements in human-like behavior are largely driven by scale or broad supervised training, rather than targeted alignment. We introduce Human Aligning LLMs (HAL), a framework for aligning language models to conversational human-likeness using an interpretable, data-driven reward. HAL derives explicit conversational traits from contrastive dialogue data, combines them into a compact scalar score, and uses this score as a transparent reward signal for alignment with standard preference optimization methods. Using this approach, we align models of varying sizes without affecting their overall performance. In large-scale human evaluations, models aligned with HAL are more frequently perceived as human-like in conversation. Because HAL operates over explicit, interpretable traits, it enables inspection of alignment behavior and diagnosis of unintended effects. More broadly, HAL demonstrates how soft, qualitative properties of language--previously outside the scope for alignment--can be made measurable and aligned in an interpretable and explainable way.

TL;DR: Quantum-enhanced LSTM with attention (QLSTMA) model improves permeability prediction in reservoir characterization by incorporating variational quantum circuits, achieving 19-20% error reduction over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatial prediction of reservoir parameters like permeability is crucial for oil/gas exploration, but existing methods struggle due to permeability's wide range and high variability. The study aims to leverage quantum computing principles to improve prediction accuracy for complex geological parameters.

Method: Developed QLSTMA model incorporating variational quantum circuits (VQCs) into LSTM recurrent cells. Designed two quantization structures: QLSTMA with Shared Gates (QLSTMA-SG) and with Independent Gates (QLSTMA-IG). Investigated effects of quantum structure configurations and number of qubits on performance.

Result: 8-qubit QLSTMA-IG model significantly outperformed traditional LSTMA, reducing MAE by 19% and RMSE by 20%. Strongest performance in regions with complex well-logging data. Increasing qubit count yields further accuracy gains despite reliance on classical simulations.

Conclusion: Study validates potential of quantum-classical hybrid neural networks for reservoir prediction, establishes foundational framework for eventual deployment on real quantum hardware, and enables extension to broader petroleum engineering and geoscience applications.

Abstract: Spatial prediction of reservoir parameters, especially permeability, is crucial for oil and gas exploration and development. However, the wide range and high variability of permeability prevent existing methods from providing reliable predictions. For the first time in subsurface spatial prediction, this study presents a quantum-enhanced long short-term memory with attention (QLSTMA) model that incorporates variational quantum circuits (VQCs) into the recurrent cell. Using quantum entanglement and superposition principles, the QLSTMA significantly improves the ability to predict complex geological parameters such as permeability. Two quantization structures, QLSTMA with Shared Gates (QLSTMA-SG) and with Independent Gates (QLSTMA-IG), are designed to investigate and evaluate the effects of quantum structure configurations and the number of qubits on model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the 8-qubit QLSTMA-IG model significantly outperforms the traditional long short-term memory with attention (LSTMA), reducing Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 19% and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) by 20%, with particularly strong performance in regions featuring complex well-logging data. These findings validate the potential of quantum-classical hybrid neural networks for reservoir prediction, indicating that increasing the number of qubits yields further accuracy gains despite the reliance on classical simulations. This study establishes a foundational framework for the eventual deployment of such models on real quantum hardware and their extension to broader applications in petroleum engineering and geoscience.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DRL algorithms require large training datasets and struggle with generalization beyond small-scale training scenarios, even within standard benchmarks.

Method: Integrates background symbolic knowledge by representing partial policies as logical rules, using online reasoning to guide training through: (i) biasing action distribution during exploration, and (ii) rescaling Q-values during exploitation.

Result: Empirical validation on challenging gridworld variants shows improved performance over state-of-the-art reward machine baseline, with enhanced interpretability, trustworthiness, and accelerated convergence.

Conclusion: Neuro-symbolic integration of symbolic knowledge with DRL improves sample efficiency, generalization, and interpretability, particularly effective in sparse-reward environments and tasks with long planning horizons.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a well-established framework for sequential decision-making in complex environments. However, state-of-the-art Deep RL (DRL) algorithms typically require large training datasets and often struggle to generalize beyond small-scale training scenarios, even within standard benchmarks. We propose a neuro-symbolic DRL approach that integrates background symbolic knowledge to improve sample efficiency and generalization to more challenging, unseen tasks. Partial policies defined for simple domain instances, where high performance is easily attained, are transferred as useful priors to accelerate learning in more complex settings and avoid tuning DRL parameters from scratch. To do so, partial policies are represented as logical rules, and online reasoning is performed to guide the training process through two mechanisms: (i) biasing the action distribution during exploration, and (ii) rescaling Q-values during exploitation. This neuro-symbolic integration enhances interpretability and trustworthiness while accelerating convergence, particularly in sparse-reward environments and tasks with long planning horizons. We empirically validate our methodology on challenging variants of gridworld environments, both in the fully observable and partially observable setting. We show improved performance over a state-of-the-art reward machine baseline.

Conclusion: M3MAD-Bench offers a reliable foundation for future standardized MAD evaluation research, addressing current limitations in evaluation consistency and modality coverage while providing comprehensive insights into multi-agent debate performance.

Abstract: As an agent-level reasoning and coordination paradigm, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) orchestrates multiple agents through structured debate to improve answer quality and support complex reasoning. However, existing research on MAD suffers from two fundamental limitations: evaluations are conducted under fragmented and inconsistent settings, hindering fair comparison, and are largely restricted to single-modality scenarios that rely on textual inputs only. To address these gaps, we introduce M3MAD-Bench, a unified and extensible benchmark for evaluating MAD methods across Multi-domain tasks, Multi-modal inputs, and Multi-dimensional metrics. M3MAD-Bench establishes standardized protocols over five core task domains: Knowledge, Mathematics, Medicine, Natural Sciences, and Complex Reasoning, and systematically covers both pure text and vision-language datasets, enabling controlled cross-modality comparison. We evaluate MAD methods on nine base models spanning different architectures, scales, and modality capabilities. Beyond accuracy, M3MAD-Bench incorporates efficiency-oriented metrics such as token consumption and inference time, providing a holistic view of performance--cost trade-offs. Extensive experiments yield systematic insights into the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of MAD across text-only and multimodal scenarios. We believe M3MAD-Bench offers a reliable foundation for future research on standardized MAD evaluation. The code is available at http://github.com/liaolea/M3MAD-Bench.

Motivation: Task-oriented proactive dialogue agents are crucial for recruitment (e.g., acquiring social-media contacts), but their performance is limited by the scarcity of high-quality, goal-oriented domain-specific training data. Existing methods like supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning are constrained by data availability.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) Develop a high-fidelity user simulator to synthesize large-scale conversational data through multi-turn online dialogue. 2) Introduce a multi-dimensional evaluation framework based on Chain-of-Intention (CoI) to assess the simulator and select high-quality data using both global-level and instance-level metrics. 3) Train the recruitment proactive dialogue agent on the selected dataset.

Conclusion: SimRPD effectively addresses the data scarcity problem in training recruitment proactive dialogue agents through synthetic data generation and quality selection, showing superior performance and practical deployment value for industrial applications.

Abstract: Task-oriented proactive dialogue agents play a pivotal role in recruitment, particularly for steering conversations towards specific business outcomes, such as acquiring social-media contacts for private-channel conversion. Although supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning have proven effective for training such agents, their performance is heavily constrained by the scarcity of high-quality, goal-oriented domain-specific training data. To address this challenge, we propose SimRPD, a three-stage framework for training recruitment proactive dialogue agents. First, we develop a high-fidelity user simulator to synthesize large-scale conversational data through multi-turn online dialogue. Then we introduce a multi-dimensional evaluation framework based on Chain-of-Intention (CoI) to comprehensively assess the simulator and effectively select high-quality data, incorporating both global-level and instance-level metrics. Finally, we train the recruitment proactive dialogue agent on the selected dataset. Experiments in a real-world recruitment scenario demonstrate that SimRPD outperforms existing simulator-based data selection strategies, highlighting its practical value for industrial deployment and its potential applicability to other business-oriented dialogue scenarios.

Conclusion: ReTreVal's combination of structured exploration, critique-driven refinement, and cross-problem memory makes it an effective framework for multi-step reasoning tasks requiring exploratory reasoning, rigorous verification, and knowledge transfer.

Abstract: Multi-step reasoning remains a key challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in complex domains such as mathematics and creative writing. While recent approaches including ReAct, Reflexion, and Self-Refine improve reasoning through iterative refinement and reflection, they often lack structured exploration of alternative solution paths and persistent learning across problems. We propose ReTreVal (Reasoning Tree with Validation), a hybrid framework that integrates Tree-of-Thoughts exploration, self-refinement, LLM-based critique scoring, and reflexion memory to enable bounded and validated multi-step reasoning. ReTreVal constructs a structured reasoning tree with adaptive depth based on problem complexity, where each node undergoes iterative self-critique and refinement guided by explicit LLM-generated feedback. A dual validation mechanism evaluates reasoning quality, coherence, and correctness at each node while persistently storing insights from successful reasoning paths and failure patterns in a reflexion memory buffer, enabling cross-problem learning. Critique-based pruning retains only the top-k highest-scoring nodes at each level, controlling computational cost while preserving high-quality solution paths. We evaluate ReTreVal against ReAct, Reflexion, and Self-Refine across 500 mathematical problems and creative writing tasks using Qwen 2.5 7B as the underlying LLM, and demonstrate that ReTreVal consistently outperforms existing methods through its combination of structured exploration, critique-driven refinement, and cross-problem memory, making it particularly effective for tasks requiring exploratory reasoning, rigorous verification, and knowledge transfer.

### [165] [Logical Phase Transitions: Understanding Collapse in LLM Logical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02902)
*Xinglang Zhang,Yunyao Zhang,ZeLiang Chen,Junqing Yu,Wei Yang,Zikai Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show abrupt performance collapse at critical logical complexity thresholds (Logical Phase Transitions), not gradual degradation. Neuro-Symbolic Curriculum Tuning mitigates this collapse by aligning language with logic and progressive training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symbolic logical reasoning is crucial for LLMs in high-stakes domains but remains underexplored. Current models may fail unpredictably at certain complexity levels, which needs systematic understanding and improvement.

Method: 1) Systematic analysis reveals Logical Phase Transitions phenomenon; 2) Neuro-Symbolic Curriculum Tuning framework with adaptive alignment of natural language and logical symbols; 3) Reshapes training dynamics around phase-transition boundaries for progressive reasoning at increasing logical depths.

Result: Approach effectively mitigates logical reasoning collapse at high complexity, achieving average accuracy gains of +1.26 in naive prompting and +3.95 in CoT across five benchmarks, with improved generalization to unseen logical compositions.

Conclusion: Logical reasoning in LLMs exhibits phase transition behavior, not smooth degradation. The proposed neuro-symbolic curriculum tuning successfully addresses this collapse, enabling more reliable logical reasoning at higher complexity levels.

Abstract: Symbolic logical reasoning is a critical yet underexplored capability of large language models (LLMs), providing reliable and verifiable decision-making in high-stakes domains such as mathematical reasoning and legal judgment. In this study, we present a systematic analysis of logical reasoning under controlled increases in logical complexity, and reveal a previously unrecognized phenomenon, which we term Logical Phase Transitions: rather than degrading smoothly, logical reasoning performance remains stable within a regime but collapses abruptly beyond a critical logical depth, mirroring physical phase transitions such as water freezing beyond a critical temperature threshold. Building on this insight, we propose Neuro-Symbolic Curriculum Tuning, a principled framework that adaptively aligns natural language with logical symbols to establish a shared representation, and reshapes training dynamics around phase-transition boundaries to progressively strengthen reasoning at increasing logical depths. Experiments on five benchmarks show that our approach effectively mitigates logical reasoning collapse at high complexity, yielding average accuracy gains of +1.26 in naive prompting and +3.95 in CoT, while improving generalization to unseen logical compositions.

*Xuan Yang,Furong Jia,Roy Xie,Xiong Xi,Hengwei Bian,Jian Li,Monica Agrawal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Batch-of-Thought (BoT) enables LLMs to process related queries jointly for cross-instance learning, improving accuracy and reducing costs through batch-aware reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM reasoning systems process queries independently, discarding valuable cross-instance signals like shared reasoning patterns and consistency constraints, which limits learning and efficiency.

Method: BoT processes related queries jointly to enable cross-instance learning through comparative analysis across batches. BoT-R implements this within a multi-agent reflection architecture where a Reflector performs joint evaluation to unlock mutual information gain.

Result: Experiments across three model families and six benchmarks show BoT-R consistently improves accuracy and confidence calibration while reducing inference costs by up to 61%.

Conclusion: Batch-aware reasoning benefits LLM systems by leveraging cross-instance signals, with theoretical and experimental analysis revealing when and why this approach is effective.

Abstract: Current Large Language Model reasoning systems process queries independently, discarding valuable cross-instance signals such as shared reasoning patterns and consistency constraints. We introduce Batch-of-Thought (BoT), a training-free method that processes related queries jointly to enable cross-instance learning. By performing comparative analysis across batches, BoT identifies high-quality reasoning templates, detects errors through consistency checks, and amortizes computational costs. We instantiate BoT within a multi-agent reflection architecture (BoT-R), where a Reflector performs joint evaluation to unlock mutual information gain unavailable in isolated processing. Experiments across three model families and six benchmarks demonstrate that BoT-R consistently improves accuracy and confidence calibration while reducing inference costs by up to 61%. Our theoretical and experimental analysis reveals when and why batch-aware reasoning benefits LLM systems.

### [167] [Rationale-Grounded In-Context Learning for Time Series Reasoning with Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02968)
*Qingxiang Liu,Zhiqing Cui,Xiaoliang Luo,Yuqian Wu,Zhuoyang Jiang,Huaiyu Wan,Sheng Sun,Lvchun Wang,Wei Yu,Yuxuan Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RationaleTS introduces rationale-grounded in-context learning for time series reasoning, using label-conditioned rationales as guiding reasoning units instead of post-hoc explanations, with hybrid retrieval balancing temporal patterns and semantic contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal LLMs underperform on time series reasoning because they lack rationale priors connecting temporal observations to outcomes, leading to superficial pattern matching rather than principled reasoning.

Method: 1) Induce label-conditioned rationales (reasoning paths from evidence to outcomes), 2) Design hybrid retrieval balancing temporal patterns and semantic contexts to retrieve correlated rationale priors, 3) Use retrieved rationales for in-context inference on new samples.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness and efficiency on three-domain time series reasoning tasks. Code will be released for reproduction.

Conclusion: RationaleTS addresses the rationale prior gap in time series reasoning by grounding in-context learning in explicit reasoning paths, moving beyond superficial pattern matching to principled reasoning.

Abstract: The underperformance of existing multimodal large language models for time series reasoning lies in the absence of rationale priors that connect temporal observations to their downstream outcomes, which leads models to rely on superficial pattern matching rather than principled reasoning. We therefore propose the rationale-grounded in-context learning for time series reasoning, where rationales work as guiding reasoning units rather than post-hoc explanations, and develop the RationaleTS method. Specifically, we firstly induce label-conditioned rationales, composed of reasoning paths from observable evidence to the potential outcomes. Then, we design the hybrid retrieval by balancing temporal patterns and semantic contexts to retrieve correlated rationale priors for the final in-context inference on new samples. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed RationaleTS on three-domain time series reasoning tasks. We will release our code for reproduction.

*Qusai Khaled,Pasquale De Marinis,Moez Louati,David Ferras,Laura Genga,Uzay Kaymak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes an explainable GNN framework with fuzzy logic for water leak detection that balances accuracy with interpretable rule-based explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GNNs for water leak detection are black-box models with limited explainability, hindering practical adoption by hydraulic engineers who need to validate predictions and optimize maintenance.

Method: Developed a fuzzy-enhanced graph neural network (FGENConv) that integrates mutual information to identify critical network regions and fuzzy logic to provide clear, rule-based explanations for node classification tasks.

Result: FGENConv achieved Graph F1 scores of 0.889 for detection and 0.814 for localization, slightly below crisp GENConv (0.938 and 0.858) but provides spatially localized, fuzzy rule-based explanations.

Conclusion: The framework strikes a balance between precision and explainability, enabling hydraulic engineers to validate leak predictions, conserve human resources, and optimize maintenance strategies.

Abstract: Timely leak detection in water distribution networks is critical for conserving resources and maintaining operational efficiency. Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at capturing spatial-temporal dependencies in sensor data, their black-box nature and the limited work on graph-based explainable models for water networks hinder practical adoption. We propose an explainable GNN framework that integrates mutual information to identify critical network regions and fuzzy logic to provide clear, rule-based explanations for node classification tasks. After benchmarking several GNN architectures, we selected the generalized graph convolution network (GENConv) for its superior performance and developed a fuzzy-enhanced variant that offers intuitive explanations for classified leak locations. Our fuzzy graph neural network (FGENConv) achieved Graph F1 scores of 0.889 for detection and 0.814 for localization, slightly below the crisp GENConv 0.938 and 0.858, respectively. Yet it compensates by providing spatially localized, fuzzy rule-based explanations. By striking the right balance between precision and explainability, the proposed fuzzy network could enable hydraulic engineers to validate predicted leak locations, conserve human resources, and optimize maintenance strategies.

*Adam Keane,Nick Pepper,Chris Burr,Amy Hodgkin,Dewi Gould,John Korna,Marc Thomas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents an assurance framework for probabilistic Digital Twins in aviation, using Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance methodology to create structured arguments for regulatory compliance and stakeholder engagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digital Twins have significant potential in aviation but face regulatory challenges. There's a need for structured approaches to demonstrate that Digital Twins accurately represent physical systems and meet regulatory requirements for AI/ML applications in Air Traffic Management.

Method: Developed an assurance framework using Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance (TEA) methodology to create structured assurance cases. The framework defines actionable goals and evidence requirements for Digital Twin accuracy and functionality across target use cases.

Result: Created a concrete framework that provides structured arguments, evidence requirements, and justifications for assessing Digital Twin fidelity. The framework supports stakeholder engagement and regulatory discussions, demonstrated through Project Bluebird's probabilistic Digital Twin of UK airspace.

Conclusion: The assurance framework offers a practical approach for researchers to document Digital Twin strengths/limitations, identify improvement areas, and engage with regulators. It contributes to emerging guidance through a working example and supports the development of application-specific regulatory requirements.

Abstract: Digital Twins combine simulation, operational data and Artificial Intelligence (AI), and have the potential to bring significant benefits across the aviation industry. Project Bluebird, an industry-academic collaboration, has developed a probabilistic Digital Twin of en route UK airspace as an environment for training and testing AI Air Traffic Control (ATC) agents. There is a developing regulatory landscape for this kind of novel technology. Regulatory requirements are expected to be application specific, and may need to be tailored to each specific use case.
  We draw on emerging guidance for both Digital Twin development and the use of Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) in Air Traffic Management (ATM) to present an assurance framework. This framework defines actionable goals and the evidence required to demonstrate that a Digital Twin accurately represents its physical counterpart and also provides sufficient functionality across target use cases. It provides a structured approach for researchers to assess, understand and document the strengths and limitations of the Digital Twin, whilst also identifying areas where fidelity could be improved. Furthermore, it serves as a foundation for engagement with stakeholders and regulators, supporting discussions around the regulatory needs for future applications, and contributing to the emerging guidance through a concrete, working example of a Digital Twin.
  The framework leverages a methodology known as Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance (TEA) to develop an assurance case. An assurance case is a nested set of structured arguments that provides justified evidence for how a top-level goal has been realised. In this paper we provide an overview of each structured argument and a number of deep dives which elaborate in more detail upon particular arguments, including the required evidence, assumptions and justifications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A simple, tuneless automatic prompt engineering system that matches existing approaches in effectiveness, applied to cryptic column name expansion in databases across English and German datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cryptic column name expansion (CNE) is critical for tabular data search, access, and understanding, but has received little research attention. Existing prompt engineering approaches are complex and require tuning, while there's a need for simpler, more accessible methods.

Method: A system for automatic prompt engineering that requires no tuning and no explicit task clues. The approach is simpler in design and application than existing methods. Evaluation focuses on CNE task using datasets in both English and German.

Result: The system is as effective as existing approaches despite being simpler. It successfully handles CNE in both English and German, making it the first work on automatic prompt engineering for non-English languages and the first application to CNE task.

Conclusion: Simple, tuneless automatic prompt engineering can be as effective as complex approaches, enabling broader accessibility and application to important but understudied tasks like cryptic column name expansion across multiple languages.

Abstract: This paper presents a system for automatic prompt engineering that is much simpler in both design and application and yet as effective as the existing approaches. It requires no tuning and no explicit clues about the task. We evaluated our approach on cryptic column name expansion (CNE) in database tables, a task which is critical for tabular data search, access, and understanding and yet there has been very little existing work. We evaluated on datasets in two languages, English and German. This is the first work to report on the application of automatic prompt engineering for the CNE task. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first work on the application of automatic prompt engineering for a language other than English.

### [171] [InfiAgent: An Infinite-Horizon Framework for General-Purpose Autonomous Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03204)
*Chenglin Yu,Yuchen Wang,Songmiao Wang,Hongxia Yang,Ming Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InfiAgent is a framework that uses file-centric state externalization to keep agent reasoning context bounded for long-horizon tasks, achieving competitive performance with smaller models while maintaining better long-term coverage than context-centric approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents struggle with long-horizon tasks due to unbounded context growth and accumulated errors. Existing solutions like context compression or retrieval-augmented prompting create trade-offs between information fidelity and reasoning stability.

Method: InfiAgent externalizes persistent state into a file-centric state abstraction, keeping reasoning context strictly bounded regardless of task duration. At each step, the agent reconstructs context from a workspace state snapshot plus a fixed window of recent actions.

Result: Experiments on DeepResearch and an 80-paper literature review task show that InfiAgent with a 20B open-source model is competitive with larger proprietary systems and maintains substantially higher long-horizon coverage than context-centric baselines.

Conclusion: Explicit state externalization provides a practical foundation for stable long-horizon agents, enabling bounded context management without compromising performance on complex, extended tasks.

Abstract: LLM agents can reason and use tools, but they often break down on long-horizon tasks due to unbounded context growth and accumulated errors. Common remedies such as context compression or retrieval-augmented prompting introduce trade-offs between information fidelity and reasoning stability. We present InfiAgent, a general-purpose framework that keeps the agent's reasoning context strictly bounded regardless of task duration by externalizing persistent state into a file-centric state abstraction. At each step, the agent reconstructs context from a workspace state snapshot plus a fixed window of recent actions. Experiments on DeepResearch and an 80-paper literature review task show that, without task-specific fine-tuning, InfiAgent with a 20B open-source model is competitive with larger proprietary systems and maintains substantially higher long-horizon coverage than context-centric baselines. These results support explicit state externalization as a practical foundation for stable long-horizon agents. Github Repo:https://github.com/ChenglinPoly/infiAgent

### [172] [MAGMA: A Multi-Graph based Agentic Memory Architecture for AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03236)
*Dongming Jiang,Yi Li,Guanpeng Li,Bingzhe Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MAGMA introduces a multi-graph memory architecture that separates memory items across semantic, temporal, causal, and entity graphs, using policy-guided traversal for query-adaptive retrieval to improve long-context reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Memory-Augmented Generation (MAG) approaches rely on semantic similarity over monolithic memory stores, which entangles temporal, causal, and entity information. This limits interpretability and alignment between query intent and retrieved evidence, leading to suboptimal reasoning accuracy.

Method: MAGMA proposes a multi-graph agentic memory architecture that represents each memory item across orthogonal semantic, temporal, causal, and entity graphs. It formulates retrieval as policy-guided traversal over these relational views, enabling query-adaptive selection and structured context construction.

Result: Experiments on LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks demonstrate that MAGMA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art agentic memory systems in long-horizon reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: By decoupling memory representation from retrieval logic, MAGMA provides transparent reasoning paths and fine-grained control over retrieval, addressing limitations of existing monolithic memory approaches in long-context reasoning.

Abstract: Memory-Augmented Generation (MAG) extends Large Language Models with external memory to support long-context reasoning, but existing approaches largely rely on semantic similarity over monolithic memory stores, entangling temporal, causal, and entity information. This design limits interpretability and alignment between query intent and retrieved evidence, leading to suboptimal reasoning accuracy. In this paper, we propose MAGMA, a multi-graph agentic memory architecture that represents each memory item across orthogonal semantic, temporal, causal, and entity graphs. MAGMA formulates retrieval as policy-guided traversal over these relational views, enabling query-adaptive selection and structured context construction. By decoupling memory representation from retrieval logic, MAGMA provides transparent reasoning paths and fine-grained control over retrieval.
