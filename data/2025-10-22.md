### [1] [MAT-Agent: Adaptive Multi-Agent Training Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17845)
*Jusheng Zhang,Kaitong Cai,Yijia Fan,Ningyuan Liu,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAT-Agent is a multi-agent framework that dynamically optimizes training parameters using bandit algorithms, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multi-label image classification benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional multi-label image classification methods use static configurations that fail in dynamic settings, requiring adaptive training strategies for complex visual-semantic landscapes.

Method: Uses autonomous agents to dynamically tune data augmentation, optimizers, learning rates, and loss functions via non-stationary multi-armed bandit algorithms, with dual-rate exponential moving average smoothing and mixed-precision training.

Result: Achieved mAP of 97.4 (vs. 96.2 for PAT-T) on Pascal VOC, 92.8 (vs. 92.0 for HSQ-CvN) on COCO, and 60.9 on VG-256, with superior OF1 and CF1 scores across all datasets.

Conclusion: MAT-Agent provides scalable, intelligent optimization for complex visual models with accelerated convergence and robust cross-domain generalization, advancing adaptive deep learning.

Abstract: Multi-label image classification demands adaptive training strategies to
navigate complex, evolving visual-semantic landscapes, yet conventional methods
rely on static configurations that falter in dynamic settings. We propose
MAT-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework that reimagines training as a
collaborative, real-time optimization process. By deploying autonomous agents
to dynamically tune data augmentation, optimizers, learning rates, and loss
functions, MAT-Agent leverages non-stationary multi-armed bandit algorithms to
balance exploration and exploitation, guided by a composite reward harmonizing
accuracy, rare-class performance, and training stability. Enhanced with
dual-rate exponential moving average smoothing and mixed-precision training, it
ensures robustness and efficiency. Extensive experiments across Pascal VOC,
COCO, and VG-256 demonstrate MAT-Agent's superiority: it achieves an mAP of
97.4 (vs. 96.2 for PAT-T), OF1 of 92.3, and CF1 of 91.4 on Pascal VOC; an mAP
of 92.8 (vs. 92.0 for HSQ-CvN), OF1 of 88.2, and CF1 of 87.1 on COCO; and an
mAP of 60.9, OF1 of 70.8, and CF1 of 61.1 on VG-256. With accelerated
convergence and robust cross-domain generalization, MAT-Agent offers a
scalable, intelligent solution for optimizing complex visual models, paving the
way for adaptive deep learning advancements.

### [2] [CoIDO: Efficient Data Selection for Visual Instruction Tuning via Coupled Importance-Diversity Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17847)
*Yichen Yan,Ming Zhong,Qi Zhu,Xiaoling Gu,Jinpeng Chen,Huan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoIDO is a dual-objective framework that jointly optimizes data importance and diversity for efficient multimodal LLM instruction tuning, achieving 98.2% of full-data performance using only 20% of data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data selection methods for MLLM instruction tuning have high computational overhead and suboptimal selection due to separate treatment of importance and diversity.

Method: CoIDO uses a lightweight plug-in scorer trained on a small random sample to learn candidate set distribution, employing homoscedastic uncertainty-based formulation to balance importance and diversity.

Result: Using only 20% of randomly sampled data to train the scorer, then selecting 20% subset achieved 98.2% of full-data fine-tuning performance on LLaVA-1.5-7B across ten downstream tasks.

Conclusion: CoIDO provides an efficient and scalable data selection method that dramatically reduces computational costs while maintaining near-full performance for multimodal LLM instruction tuning.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely heavily on instruction tuning
to align vision and language capabilities, yet the computational cost of
training on large-scale datasets remains a major bottleneck. Existing data
selection methods aim to mitigate this by selecting important and diverse
subsets, but they often suffer from two critical drawbacks: high computational
overhead from processing the entire dataset and suboptimal data selection due
to separate treatment of importance and diversity.
  We introduce CoIDO, a novel dual-objective framework that jointly optimizes
data importance and diversity to overcome these challenges. Unlike existing
approaches that require costly evaluations across the whole dataset, CoIDO
employs a lightweight plug-in scorer. This scorer is trained on just a small
random sample of data to learn the distribution of the candidate set,
drastically reducing computational demands. By leveraging a homoscedastic
uncertainty-based formulation, CoIDO effectively balances importance and
diversity during training, enabling efficient and scalable data selection.
  In our experiments, we trained the CoIDO scorer using only 20 percent of
randomly sampled data. Once trained, CoIDO was applied to the entire dataset to
select a 20 percent subset for instruction tuning. On the widely used
LLaVA-1.5-7B model across ten downstream tasks, this selected subset achieved
an impressive 98.2 percent of the performance of full-data fine-tuning, on
average.

### [3] [Pre to Post-Treatment Glioblastoma MRI Prediction using a Latent Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17851)
*Alexandre G. Leclercq,Sébastien Bougleux,Noémie N. Moreau,Alexis Desmonts,Romain Hérault,Aurélien Corroyer-Dulmont*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Latent Diffusion Model is proposed for early visual treatment response prediction in glioblastoma, generating post-treatment MRI from pre-treatment MRI and tumor localization using classifier-free guidance with survival information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early prediction of treatment response in glioblastoma is crucial for personalized medicine, as current methods require at least two months to observe visual impact via MRI, and patients show highly heterogeneous therapeutic responses.

Method: A slice-to-slice translation model using Latent Diffusion Model with concatenation-based conditioning from pre-treatment MRI and tumor localization, enhanced by classifier-free guidance using survival information to reflect post-treatment tumor evolution.

Result: The model was trained and tested on a local dataset of 140 GBM patients with pre/post T1-Gd MRI, manually delineated tumor localization, and survival information collected at Centre François Baclesse.

Conclusion: The proposed approach addresses early visual treatment response prediction by generating post-treatment MRI from pre-treatment data, potentially enabling earlier assessment of therapeutic interventions in glioblastoma patients.

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive primary brain tumor with a median
survival of approximately 15 months. In clinical practice, the Stupp protocol
serves as the standard first-line treatment. However, patients exhibit highly
heterogeneous therapeutic responses which required at least two months before
first visual impact can be observed, typically with MRI. Early prediction
treatment response is crucial for advancing personalized medicine. Disease
Progression Modeling (DPM) aims to capture the trajectory of disease evolution,
while Treatment Response Prediction (TRP) focuses on assessing the impact of
therapeutic interventions. Whereas most TRP approaches primarly rely on
timeseries data, we consider the problem of early visual TRP as a
slice-to-slice translation model generating post-treatment MRI from a
pre-treatment MRI, thus reflecting the tumor evolution. To address this problem
we propose a Latent Diffusion Model with a concatenation-based conditioning
from the pre-treatment MRI and the tumor localization, and a classifier-free
guidance to enhance generation quality using survival information, in
particular post-treatment tumor evolution. Our model were trained and tested on
a local dataset consisting of 140 GBM patients collected at Centre Fran\c{c}ois
Baclesse. For each patient we collected pre and post T1-Gd MRI, tumor
localization manually delineated in the pre-treatment MRI by medical experts,
and survival information.

### [4] [Provenance of AI-Generated Images: A Vector Similarity and Blockchain-based Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17854)
*Jitendra Sharma,Arthur Carvalho,Suman Bhunia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an embedding-based framework using vector similarity to detect AI-generated images by analyzing embedding proximity patterns between AI and human-created content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of generative AI and LLMs enables creation of highly realistic images indistinguishable from human-created ones, posing challenges for digital content authentication and trust maintenance.

Method: Uses image embeddings and vector similarity from five benchmark embedding models to distinguish AI-generated from human-created images, based on the hypothesis that AI-generated images cluster closer to other AI content.

Result: Extensive experiments show robustness with moderate to high perturbations minimally impacting embedding signatures, and perturbed images maintain close similarity to originals.

Conclusion: Provides a generalizable framework for AI-generated image detection that balances accuracy with computational efficiency.

Abstract: Rapid advancement in generative AI and large language models (LLMs) has
enabled the generation of highly realistic and contextually relevant digital
content. LLMs such as ChatGPT with DALL-E integration and Stable Diffusion
techniques can produce images that are often indistinguishable from those
created by humans, which poses challenges for digital content authentication.
Verifying the integrity and origin of digital data to ensure it remains
unaltered and genuine is crucial to maintaining trust and legality in digital
media. In this paper, we propose an embedding-based AI image detection
framework that utilizes image embeddings and a vector similarity to distinguish
AI-generated images from real (human-created) ones. Our methodology is built on
the hypothesis that AI-generated images demonstrate closer embedding proximity
to other AI-generated content, while human-created images cluster similarly
within their domain. To validate this hypothesis, we developed a system that
processes a diverse dataset of AI and human-generated images through five
benchmark embedding models. Extensive experimentation demonstrates the
robustness of our approach, and our results confirm that moderate to high
perturbations minimally impact the embedding signatures, with perturbed images
maintaining close similarity matches to their original versions. Our solution
provides a generalizable framework for AI-generated image detection that
balances accuracy with computational efficiency.

### [5] [CMIS-Net: A Cascaded Multi-Scale Individual Standardization Network for Backchannel Agreement Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17855)
*Yuxuan Huang,Kangzhong Wang,Eugene Yujun Fu,Grace Ngai,Peter H. F. Ng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CMIS-Net is a novel framework for backchannel agreement detection that addresses individual differences through multi-scale individual standardization and implicit data augmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backchannels are crucial for human-like AI interactions but are significantly influenced by individual differences across multiple scales. Existing emotion recognition methods operate at single scales and overlook multi-scale behavioral cues, creating a complex pattern recognition challenge.

Method: Proposed Cascaded Multi-Scale Individual Standardization Network (CMIS-Net) that extracts individual-normalized backchannel features by removing person-specific neutral baselines at both frame and sequence levels. Also includes implicit data augmentation to address training data distributional bias.

Result: Comprehensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate that CMIS-Net effectively handles individual differences and data imbalance, achieving state-of-the-art performance in backchannel agreement detection.

Conclusion: The proposed CMIS-Net framework successfully addresses the challenges of individual differences in backchannel behaviors through multi-scale standardization and data augmentation, enabling more accurate and generalized backchannel detection for responsive AI systems.

Abstract: Backchannels are subtle listener responses, such as nods, smiles, or short
verbal cues like "yes" or "uh-huh," which convey understanding and agreement in
conversations. These signals provide feedback to speakers, improve the
smoothness of interaction, and play a crucial role in developing human-like,
responsive AI systems. However, the expression of backchannel behaviors is
often significantly influenced by individual differences, operating across
multiple scales: from instant dynamics such as response intensity (frame-level)
to temporal patterns such as frequency and rhythm preferences (sequence-level).
This presents a complex pattern recognition problem that contemporary emotion
recognition methods have yet to fully address. Particularly, existing
individualized methods in emotion recognition often operate at a single scale,
overlooking the complementary nature of multi-scale behavioral cues. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel Cascaded Multi-Scale Individual
Standardization Network (CMIS-Net) that extracts individual-normalized
backchannel features by removing person-specific neutral baselines from
observed expressions. Operating at both frame and sequence levels, this
normalization allows model to focus on relative changes from each person's
baseline rather than absolute expression values. Furthermore, we introduce an
implicit data augmentation module to address the observed training data
distributional bias, improving model generalization. Comprehensive experiments
and visualizations demonstrate that CMIS-Net effectively handles individual
differences and data imbalance, achieving state-of-the-art performance in
backchannel agreement detection.

### [6] [TriggerNet: A Novel Explainable AI Framework for Red Palm Mite Detection and Multi-Model Comparison and Heuristic-Guided Annotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18038)
*Harshini Suresha,Kavitha SH*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study evaluates ML models for detecting red palm mite infestation using TriggerNet, an interpretable AI framework that combines multiple explanation methods for plant classification and disease detection across 11 plant species.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Red palm mite infestation causes significant productivity losses in palm cultivation, making early and accurate identification critical for effective management and economic protection.

Method: Used TriggerNet framework with Grad-CAM, RISE, FullGrad, and TCAV for interpretable AI. Applied CNN, EfficientNet, MobileNet, ViT, ResNet50, InceptionV3 for plant classification, and Random Forest, SVM, KNN for comparison. Used Snorkel for automated disease class labeling (Healthy, Yellow Spots, Reddish Bronzing, Silk Webbing).

Result: Developed a comprehensive framework for classifying 11 plant species and detecting four disease classes related to red palm mite infestation using diverse RGB image dataset.

Conclusion: TriggerNet provides an effective interpretable AI solution for red palm mite detection, enabling better disease management through improved classification accuracy and visual explanations.

Abstract: The red palm mite infestation has become a serious concern, particularly in
regions with extensive palm cultivation, leading to reduced productivity and
economic losses. Accurate and early identification of mite-infested plants is
critical for effective management. The current study focuses on evaluating and
comparing the ML model for classifying the affected plants and detecting the
infestation. TriggerNet is a novel interpretable AI framework that integrates
Grad-CAM, RISE, FullGrad, and TCAV to generate novel visual explanations for
deep learning models in plant classification and disease detection. This study
applies TriggerNet to address red palm mite (Raoiella indica) infestation, a
major threat to palm cultivation and agricultural productivity. A diverse set
of RGB images across 11 plant species, Arecanut, Date Palm, Bird of Paradise,
Coconut Palm, Ginger, Citrus Tree, Palm Oil, Orchid, Banana Palm, Avocado Tree,
and Cast Iron Plant was utilized for training and evaluation. Advanced deep
learning models like CNN, EfficientNet, MobileNet, ViT, ResNet50, and
InceptionV3, alongside machine learning classifiers such as Random Forest, SVM,
and KNN, were employed for plant classification. For disease classification,
all plants were categorized into four classes: Healthy, Yellow Spots, Reddish
Bronzing, and Silk Webbing. Snorkel was used to efficiently label these disease
classes by leveraging heuristic rules and patterns, reducing manual annotation
time and improving dataset reliability.

### [7] [Shortcutting Pre-trained Flow Matching Diffusion Models is Almost Free Lunch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17858)
*Xu Cai,Yang Wu,Qianli Chen,Haoran Wu,Lichuan Xiang,Hongkai Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An ultra-efficient post-training method that shortcuts large flow matching diffusion models into few-step samplers using velocity field self-distillation, eliminating the need for step-size embedding and enabling efficient training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing shortcutting methods require specialized step-size embedding incompatible with standard models, necessitating costly retraining from scratch.

Method: Uses velocity field self-distillation to impart aggressive shortcut mechanisms to standard flow matching models, working on velocity field rather than sample space with online self-guided distillation.

Result: Achieves efficient training (e.g., 3-step Flux in <1 A100 day), enables few-shot distillation (10 text-image pairs) for billion-parameter models with state-of-the-art performance at minimal cost.

Conclusion: The method provides an efficient way to create few-step samplers from pre-trained models and can be incorporated into pretraining, enabling high-quality few-step generation without compromising performance.

Abstract: We present an ultra-efficient post-training method for shortcutting
large-scale pre-trained flow matching diffusion models into efficient few-step
samplers, enabled by novel velocity field self-distillation. While shortcutting
in flow matching, originally introduced by shortcut models, offers flexible
trajectory-skipping capabilities, it requires a specialized step-size embedding
incompatible with existing models unless retraining from
scratch$\unicode{x2013}$a process nearly as costly as pretraining itself.
  Our key contribution is thus imparting a more aggressive shortcut mechanism
to standard flow matching models (e.g., Flux), leveraging a unique distillation
principle that obviates the need for step-size embedding. Working on the
velocity field rather than sample space and learning rapidly from self-guided
distillation in an online manner, our approach trains efficiently, e.g.,
producing a 3-step Flux less than one A100 day. Beyond distillation, our method
can be incorporated into the pretraining stage itself, yielding models that
inherently learn efficient, few-step flows without compromising quality. This
capability also enables, to our knowledge, the first few-shot distillation
method (e.g., 10 text-image pairs) for dozen-billion-parameter diffusion
models, delivering state-of-the-art performance at almost free cost.

### [8] [Robotic Classification of Divers' Swimming States using Visual Pose Keypoints as IMUs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17863)
*Demetrious T. Kutzke,Ying-Kun Wu,Elizabeth Terveen,Junaed Sattar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid approach for underwater human activity recognition that uses computer vision to generate pseudo-IMU data from 3D joint keypoints, enabling detection of scuba diver distress signals without relying on wireless communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional activity recognition methods fail in underwater environments due to wireless signal attenuation, creating safety risks for scuba divers who face medical emergencies like cardiac arrest.

Method: Leverages computer vision to generate high-fidelity motion data (pseudo-IMU) from 3D human joint keypoints, integrated with an onboard classifier in an AUV to detect anomalous diver behavior.

Result: The system successfully identifies simulated distress scenarios and demonstrates effectiveness for robotic monitoring of diver safety in underwater environments.

Conclusion: This hybrid approach provides a viable solution for underwater diver safety monitoring by overcoming wireless communication limitations and enabling real-time detection of medical emergencies.

Abstract: Traditional human activity recognition uses either direct image analysis or
data from wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs), but can be ineffective in
challenging underwater environments. We introduce a novel hybrid approach that
bridges this gap to monitor scuba diver safety. Our method leverages computer
vision to generate high-fidelity motion data, effectively creating a
``pseudo-IMU'' from a stream of 3D human joint keypoints. This technique
circumvents the critical problem of wireless signal attenuation in water, which
plagues conventional diver-worn sensors communicating with an Autonomous
Underwater Vehicle (AUV). We apply this system to the vital task of identifying
anomalous scuba diver behavior that signals the onset of a medical emergency
such as cardiac arrest -- a leading cause of scuba diving fatalities. By
integrating our classifier onboard an AUV and conducting experiments with
simulated distress scenarios, we demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of
our method for advancing robotic monitoring and diver safety.

TL;DR: InsideOut extends 3D Gaussian splatting to fuse RGB surface details with subsurface X-ray structures, addressing challenges in multi-modal data fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between high-fidelity RGB surface details and subsurface X-ray structures, which is valuable for medical diagnostics, cultural heritage restoration, and manufacturing.

Method: Collect paired RGB and X-ray data, perform hierarchical fitting to align RGB and X-ray radiative Gaussian splats, and use an X-ray reference loss for consistent internal structures.

Result: InsideOut effectively addresses challenges of disparate data representations and limited paired datasets between RGB and X-ray modalities.

Conclusion: This approach significantly extends 3DGS applicability, enhancing visualization, simulation, and non-destructive testing capabilities across various domains.

Abstract: We introduce InsideOut, an extension of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) that
bridges the gap between high-fidelity RGB surface details and subsurface X-ray
structures. The fusion of RGB and X-ray imaging is invaluable in fields such as
medical diagnostics, cultural heritage restoration, and manufacturing. We
collect new paired RGB and X-ray data, perform hierarchical fitting to align
RGB and X-ray radiative Gaussian splats, and propose an X-ray reference loss to
ensure consistent internal structures. InsideOut effectively addresses the
challenges posed by disparate data representations between the two modalities
and limited paired datasets. This approach significantly extends the
applicability of 3DGS, enhancing visualization, simulation, and non-destructive
testing capabilities across various domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MUSE is a training-free framework for zero-shot 2D object detection and segmentation that uses 3D object templates and joint similarity metrics with uncertainty-aware priors, achieving SOTA on BOP Challenge 2025.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a generalizable framework for zero-shot 2D object detection and segmentation without requiring additional training or fine-tuning.

Method: Uses 2D multi-view templates from 3D objects and 2D proposals; integrates class and patch embeddings with GeM pooling; employs joint similarity metric combining absolute and relative scores; refines with uncertainty-aware object prior.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on BOP Challenge 2025, ranking first across Classic Core, H3, and Industrial tracks.

Conclusion: MUSE provides a powerful and generalizable framework for zero-shot 2D object detection and segmentation without training requirements.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce MUSE (Model-based Uncertainty-aware Similarity
Estimation), a training-free framework designed for model-based zero-shot 2D
object detection and segmentation. MUSE leverages 2D multi-view templates
rendered from 3D unseen objects and 2D object proposals extracted from input
query images. In the embedding stage, it integrates class and patch embeddings,
where the patch embeddings are normalized using generalized mean pooling (GeM)
to capture both global and local representations efficiently. During the
matching stage, MUSE employs a joint similarity metric that combines absolute
and relative similarity scores, enhancing the robustness of matching under
challenging scenarios. Finally, the similarity score is refined through an
uncertainty-aware object prior that adjusts for proposal reliability. Without
any additional training or fine-tuning, MUSE achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the BOP Challenge 2025, ranking first across the Classic Core,
H3, and Industrial tracks. These results demonstrate that MUSE offers a
powerful and generalizable framework for zero-shot 2D object detection and
segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the scarcity of annotated data in Optical Music Recognition (OMR) by developing a GAN-based method to generate realistic handwritten musical scores, showing significant progress in synthetic score generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of real annotated data in Optical Music Recognition, especially for handwritten historical musical scores, hinders the development of better recognition systems. Similar fields like Handwritten Text Recognition have shown that synthetic data can improve training.

Method: Implemented a music symbol-level Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate realistic handwritten-looking musical symbols, then assembled these symbols into full scores using the Smashcima engraving software.

Result: The generated symbols exhibit a high degree of visual realism, with systematic evaluation confirming their fidelity. This represents significant progress in synthetic score generation.

Conclusion: The proposed GAN-based approach successfully generates realistic handwritten musical scores, offering a promising solution to the data scarcity problem in Optical Music Recognition.

Abstract: The field of Optical Music Recognition (OMR) is currently hindered by the
scarcity of real annotated data, particularly when dealing with handwritten
historical musical scores. In similar fields, such as Handwritten Text
Recognition, it was proven that synthetic examples produced with image
generation techniques could help to train better-performing recognition
architectures. This study explores the generation of realistic,
handwritten-looking scores by implementing a music symbol-level Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) and assembling its output into a full score using the
Smashcima engraving software. We have systematically evaluated the visual
fidelity of these generated samples, concluding that the generated symbols
exhibit a high degree of realism, marking significant progress in synthetic
score generation.

*Tadesse K Bahiru,Natnael Tilahun Sinshaw,Teshager Hailemariam Moges,Dheeraj Kumar Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses bias in gender classification systems by auditing datasets, revealing intersectional underrepresentation, and creating BalancedFace - a balanced dataset that significantly improves fairness metrics while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gender classification systems inherit and amplify demographic imbalances from training data, leading to biased performance across different demographic subgroups.

Method: 1) Audited five widely used gender classification datasets for intersectional underrepresentation 2) Trained identical MobileNetV2 classifiers on the most balanced datasets (UTKFace and FairFace) 3) Created BalancedFace by blending images from FairFace and UTKFace and supplementing with other collections to fill demographic gaps, equalizing subgroup shares across 189 intersections of age, race, and gender using only real, unedited images

Result: BalancedFace reduces the maximum True Positive Rate gap across racial subgroups by over 50% and brings the average Disparate Impact score 63% closer to the ideal of 1.0 compared to the next-best dataset, with minimal loss of overall accuracy.

Conclusion: Data-centric interventions like BalancedFace provide profound value for fair gender classification research, demonstrating that carefully engineered datasets can significantly mitigate bias while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Gender classification systems often inherit and amplify demographic
imbalances in their training data. We first audit five widely used gender
classification datasets, revealing that all suffer from significant
intersectional underrepresentation. To measure the downstream impact of these
flaws, we train identical MobileNetV2 classifiers on the two most balanced of
these datasets, UTKFace and FairFace. Our fairness evaluation shows that even
these models exhibit significant bias, misclassifying female faces at a higher
rate than male faces and amplifying existing racial skew. To counter these
data-induced biases, we construct BalancedFace, a new public dataset created by
blending images from FairFace and UTKFace, supplemented with images from other
collections to fill missing demographic gaps. It is engineered to equalize
subgroup shares across 189 intersections of age, race, and gender using only
real, unedited images. When a standard classifier is trained on BalancedFace,
it reduces the maximum True Positive Rate gap across racial subgroups by over
50% and brings the average Disparate Impact score 63% closer to the ideal of
1.0 compared to the next-best dataset, all with a minimal loss of overall
accuracy. These results underline the profound value of data-centric
interventions and provide an openly available resource for fair gender
classification research.

### [13] [3D Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation via Class-Aware and Geometry-Guided Pseudo-Label Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17875)
*Xiaoxu Xu,Xuexun Liu,Jinlong Li,Yitian Yuan,Qiudan Zhang,Lin Ma,Nicu Sebe,Xu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 3D weakly supervised semantic segmentation method that integrates geometric priors with class-aware guidance to generate high-quality pseudo labels through iterative refinement and self-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of previous 3D WSSS methods that suffer from low-quality pseudo-labels and insufficient exploitation of 3D geometric priors, which create significant bottlenecks for developing high-performance models.

Method: Uses Class-Aware Label Refinement for balanced pseudo labels, Geometry-Aware Label Refinement with 3D geometric constraints to filter low-confidence labels, and Label Update strategy with Self-Training to propagate labels to unlabeled regions through iterative refinement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet and S3DIS benchmarks and demonstrates remarkable generalization capability in unsupervised settings with competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology effectively integrates 3D geometric priors into weakly supervised learning, enabling high-performance 3D semantic segmentation with reduced annotation requirements through robust pseudo-label generation and refinement.

Abstract: 3D weakly supervised semantic segmentation (3D WSSS) aims to achieve semantic
segmentation by leveraging sparse or low-cost annotated data, significantly
reducing reliance on dense point-wise annotations. Previous works mainly employ
class activation maps or pre-trained vision-language models to address this
challenge. However, the low quality of pseudo-labels and the insufficient
exploitation of 3D geometric priors jointly create significant technical
bottlenecks in developing high-performance 3D WSSS models. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective 3D weakly supervised semantic segmentation
method that integrates 3D geometric priors into a class-aware guidance
mechanism to generate high-fidelity pseudo labels. Concretely, our designed
methodology first employs Class-Aware Label Refinement module to generate more
balanced and accurate pseudo labels for semantic categrories. This initial
refinement stage focuses on enhancing label quality through category-specific
optimization. Subsequently, the Geometry-Aware Label Refinement component is
developed, which strategically integrates implicit 3D geometric constraints to
effectively filter out low-confidence pseudo labels that fail to comply with
geometric plausibility. Moreover, to address the challenge of extensive
unlabeled regions, we propose a Label Update strategy that integrates
Self-Training to propagate labels into these areas. This iterative process
continuously enhances pseudo-label quality while expanding label coverage,
ultimately fostering the development of high-performance 3D WSSS models.
Comprehensive experimental validation reveals that our proposed methodology
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both ScanNet and S3DIS benchmarks
while demonstrating remarkable generalization capability in unsupervised
settings, maintaining competitive accuracy through its robust design.

*Ghazal Danaee,Marc Niethammer,Jarrett Rushmore,Sylvain Bouix*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study evaluates fairness in medical image segmentation by analyzing performance disparities across demographic groups (race and sex) for nucleus accumbens segmentation in MRI using three deep learning models and one traditional method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address growing concerns about unfairness and performance disparities in medical AI based on sensitive attributes like race and sex, particularly in structural MRI segmentation.

Method: Used four segmentation methods (UNesT, nnU-Net, CoTr, ANTs) on a dataset with four demographic subgroups. Employed manually labeled gold-standard segmentations, fairness metrics, and linear mixed models to analyze demographic effects on segmentation accuracy and derived volumes.

Result: Training on race-matched data significantly improved segmentation accuracy for ANTs and UNesT, while nnU-Net showed robust performance regardless of demographic matching. Sex effects from manual segmentation persisted in biased models, but race effects disappeared in all but one model.

Conclusion: Demographic matching affects segmentation performance differently across models, with nnU-Net demonstrating demographic robustness. Biased models can preserve sex effects but often lose race effects in volume measurements, highlighting the importance of fairness considerations in medical AI.

Abstract: Deep-learning-based segmentation algorithms have substantially advanced the
field of medical image analysis, particularly in structural delineations in
MRIs. However, an important consideration is the intrinsic bias in the data.
Concerns about unfairness, such as performance disparities based on sensitive
attributes like race and sex, are increasingly urgent. In this work, we
evaluate the results of three different segmentation models (UNesT, nnU-Net,
and CoTr) and a traditional atlas-based method (ANTs), applied to segment the
left and right nucleus accumbens (NAc) in MRI images. We utilize a dataset
including four demographic subgroups: black female, black male, white female,
and white male. We employ manually labeled gold-standard segmentations to train
and test segmentation models. This study consists of two parts: the first
assesses the segmentation performance of models, while the second measures the
volumes they produce to evaluate the effects of race, sex, and their
interaction. Fairness is quantitatively measured using a metric designed to
quantify fairness in segmentation performance. Additionally, linear mixed
models analyze the impact of demographic variables on segmentation accuracy and
derived volumes. Training on the same race as the test subjects leads to
significantly better segmentation accuracy for some models. ANTs and UNesT show
notable improvements in segmentation accuracy when trained and tested on
race-matched data, unlike nnU-Net, which demonstrates robust performance
independent of demographic matching. Finally, we examine sex and race effects
on the volume of the NAc using segmentations from the manual rater and from our
biased models. Results reveal that the sex effects observed with manual
segmentation can also be observed with biased models, whereas the race effects
disappear in all but one model.

Abstract: Engagement detection in online learning environments is vital for improving
student outcomes and personalizing instruction. We present ViBED-Net
(Video-Based Engagement Detection Network), a novel deep learning framework
designed to assess student engagement from video data using a dual-stream
architecture. ViBED-Net captures both facial expressions and full-scene context

spatial feature extraction. These features are then analyzed over time using
two temporal modeling strategies: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and
Transformer encoders. Our model is evaluated on the DAiSEE dataset, a
large-scale benchmark for affective state recognition in e-learning. To enhance
performance on underrepresented engagement classes, we apply targeted data
augmentation techniques. Among the tested variants, ViBED-Net with LSTM
achieves 73.43\% accuracy, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.
ViBED-Net demonstrates that combining face-aware and scene-aware spatiotemporal
cues significantly improves engagement detection accuracy. Its modular design
allows flexibility for application across education, user experience research,

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving systems are vulnerable to rare, out-of-distribution scenarios with semantic anomalies, and current VLM approaches suffer from unreliable performance and dependency on expensive proprietary models.

Method: A structured reasoning framework with layered scene analysis across four semantic layers (Street, Infrastructure, Movable Objects, Environment) using a two-phase pipeline: structured scene description extraction followed by multi-modal evaluation.

Result: Achieved 89.6% recall and 88.0% accuracy on real-world driving scenarios, and enabled a fine-tuned 7B parameter open-source model to achieve 90.8% recall and 93.8% accuracy, surpassing all evaluated models while enabling local deployment at near-zero cost.

Conclusion: SAVANT addresses the critical data scarcity problem in anomaly detection by automatically labeling real-world images with high accuracy and provides a practical path toward reliable, accessible semantic monitoring for autonomous systems.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems remain critically vulnerable to the long-tail of
rare, out-of-distribution scenarios with semantic anomalies. While Vision
Language Models (VLMs) offer promising reasoning capabilities, naive prompting
approaches yield unreliable performance and depend on expensive proprietary
models, limiting practical deployment. We introduce SAVANT (Semantic Analysis
with Vision-Augmented Anomaly deTection), a structured reasoning framework that
achieves high accuracy and recall in detecting anomalous driving scenarios from
input images through layered scene analysis and a two-phase pipeline:
structured scene description extraction followed by multi-modal evaluation. Our
approach transforms VLM reasoning from ad-hoc prompting to systematic analysis
across four semantic layers: Street, Infrastructure, Movable Objects, and
Environment. SAVANT achieves 89.6% recall and 88.0% accuracy on real-world
driving scenarios, significantly outperforming unstructured baselines. More
importantly, we demonstrate that our structured framework enables a fine-tuned
7B parameter open-source model (Qwen2.5VL) to achieve 90.8% recall and 93.8%
accuracy - surpassing all models evaluated while enabling local deployment at
near-zero cost. By automatically labeling over 9,640 real-world images with
high accuracy, SAVANT addresses the critical data scarcity problem in anomaly
detection and provides a practical path toward reliable, accessible semantic
monitoring for autonomous systems.

TL;DR: HouseTour generates smooth 3D camera trajectories and natural language summaries from image collections using diffusion models constrained by camera poses, integrated with vision-language models for 3D-grounded descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models struggle with geometric reasoning for spatial understanding, creating a need for automated professional-quality video creation for real estate and touristic applications without specialized expertise.

Method: Uses diffusion process constrained by known camera poses to generate smooth trajectories, integrates this with VLMs for 3D-grounded descriptions, and synthesizes final videos using 3D Gaussian splatting for novel view rendering.

Result: Incorporating 3D camera trajectories improves text generation performance over independent task handling. Experiments show enhanced performance with new joint metric evaluation on the HouseTour dataset containing 1,200 house-tour videos.

Conclusion: The method enables automated professional-quality video creation for real estate and tourism applications, demonstrating that 3D-aware trajectory generation enhances vision-language model performance for spatial understanding tasks.

Abstract: We introduce HouseTour, a method for spatially-aware 3D camera trajectory and
natural language summary generation from a collection of images depicting an
existing 3D space. Unlike existing vision-language models (VLMs), which
struggle with geometric reasoning, our approach generates smooth video
trajectories via a diffusion process constrained by known camera poses and
integrates this information into the VLM for 3D-grounded descriptions. We
synthesize the final video using 3D Gaussian splatting to render novel views
along the trajectory. To support this task, we present the HouseTour dataset,
which includes over 1,200 house-tour videos with camera poses, 3D
reconstructions, and real estate descriptions. Experiments demonstrate that
incorporating 3D camera trajectories into the text generation process improves
performance over methods handling each task independently. We evaluate both
individual and end-to-end performance, introducing a new joint metric. Our work
enables automated, professional-quality video creation for real estate and
touristic applications without requiring specialized expertise or equipment.

TL;DR: Chimera is a personalized image generation model that combines specified parts from different source images using textual instructions, outperforming baselines in part alignment and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing personalized image generative models lack explicit control for composing objects from specific parts of multiple source images without user-specified masks or annotations.

Method: Constructed a dataset from 464 unique (part, subject) pairs (semantic atoms), generated 37k prompts, trained a custom diffusion prior model with part-conditional guidance to enforce semantic identity and spatial layout.

Result: Chimera outperforms other baselines by 14% in part alignment and compositional accuracy and 21% in visual quality according to human evaluations and the proposed PartEval metric.

Conclusion: Chimera enables effective composition of objects from multiple source images through textual instructions, demonstrating superior performance in part alignment and visual quality compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Personalized image generative models are highly proficient at synthesizing
images from text or a single image, yet they lack explicit control for
composing objects from specific parts of multiple source images without user
specified masks or annotations. To address this, we introduce Chimera, a
personalized image generation model that generates novel objects by combining
specified parts from different source images according to textual instructions.
To train our model, we first construct a dataset from a taxonomy built on 464
unique (part, subject) pairs, which we term semantic atoms. From this, we
generate 37k prompts and synthesize the corresponding images with a
high-fidelity text-to-image model. We train a custom diffusion prior model with
part-conditional guidance, which steers the image-conditioning features to
enforce both semantic identity and spatial layout. We also introduce an
objective metric PartEval to assess the fidelity and compositional accuracy of
generation pipelines. Human evaluations and our proposed metric show that
Chimera outperforms other baselines by 14% in part alignment and compositional
accuracy and 21% in visual quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study explores using SEM imaging combined with YOLO machine learning models for microplastic detection, focusing on filtration scenarios with patterned backgrounds, and identifies challenges like limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Microplastics are widespread pollutants that are difficult to detect due to their microscopic size, and current detection methods like SEM require manual analysis, preventing efficient large-scale screening.

Method: Combined SEM imaging with machine learning-based object detection (YOLO models) in filtration scenarios with symmetric and repetitive background patterns, with focus on preprocessing optimization.

Result: Found differences in YOLO model performance for microplastic detection and identified the importance of preprocessing optimization, but also revealed limitations due to insufficient expert-labeled training data.

Conclusion: Machine learning shows potential for advancing microplastic detection but faces challenges including limited labeled datasets needed for reliable model training.

Abstract: Microplastics (MPs) are ubiquitous pollutants with demonstrated potential to
impact ecosystems and human health. Their microscopic size complicates
detection, classification, and removal, especially in biological and
environmental samples. While techniques like optical microscopy, Scanning
Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) provide a sound
basis for detection, applying these approaches requires usually manual analysis
and prevents efficient use in large screening studies. To this end, machine
learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool in advancing microplastic
detection. In this exploratory study, we investigate potential, limitations and
future directions of advancing the detection and quantification of MP particles
and fibres using a combination of SEM imaging and machine learning-based object
detection. For simplicity, we focus on a filtration scenario where image
backgrounds exhibit a symmetric and repetitive pattern. Our findings indicate
differences in the quality of YOLO models for the given task and the relevance
of optimizing preprocessing. At the same time, we identify open challenges,
such as limited amounts of expert-labeled data necessary for reliable training
of ML models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APT uses adaptive patch sizes in Vision Transformers to reduce input sequence length, achieving 40-50% throughput improvement while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard ViTs use uniform patch sizes regardless of image content, leading to inefficient long input sequences for high-resolution images.

Method: APT allocates larger patch sizes in homogeneous areas and smaller patches in complex regions within the same image, reducing total input tokens.

Result: 40% throughput improvement on ViT-L, 50% on ViT-H, 30% faster training/inference in visual tasks, with no performance loss. Can be applied to fine-tuned ViTs in just 1 epoch.

Conclusion: APT provides significant efficiency gains for Vision Transformers through adaptive patch sizing while preserving model performance.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) partition input images into uniformly sized
patches regardless of their content, resulting in long input sequence lengths
for high-resolution images. We present Adaptive Patch Transformers (APT), which
addresses this by using multiple different patch sizes within the same image.
APT reduces the total number of input tokens by allocating larger patch sizes
in more homogeneous areas and smaller patches in more complex ones. APT
achieves a drastic speedup in ViT inference and training, increasing throughput
by 40% on ViT-L and 50% on ViT-H while maintaining downstream performance, and
can be applied to a previously fine-tuned ViT, converging in as little as 1
epoch. It also significantly reduces training and inference time without loss
of performance in high-resolution dense visual tasks, achieving up to 30\%
faster training and inference in visual QA, object detection, and semantic
segmentation.

TL;DR: This tutorial provides a comprehensive overview of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), covering its pipeline, limitations, and applications in 3D reconstruction and content generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D reconstruction from posed images is undergoing transformation with advances in 3DGS, which enables efficient rasterization through volumetric splatting but suffers from memory issues, baked lighting effects, and limited secondary-ray support.

Method: The tutorial explores the 3DGS pipeline starting from splatting formulation and examines efforts to address its limitations, including memory footprint, lighting effects, and secondary-ray constraints.

Result: 3DGS offers real-time rendering capabilities for novel view synthesis and seamless integration with graphics pipelines, making it suitable for various applications despite current limitations.

Conclusion: 3D Gaussian Splatting represents a significant advancement in 3D reconstruction with efficient rendering capabilities, though challenges remain in memory usage, lighting representation, and secondary-ray effects that require ongoing research.

Abstract: The problem of 3D reconstruction from posed images is undergoing a
fundamental transformation, driven by continuous advances in 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS). By modeling scenes explicitly as collections of 3D Gaussians,
3DGS enables efficient rasterization through volumetric splatting, offering
thus a seamless integration with common graphics pipelines. Despite its
real-time rendering capabilities for novel view synthesis, 3DGS suffers from a
high memory footprint, the tendency to bake lighting effects directly into its
representation, and limited support for secondary-ray effects. This tutorial
provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of the 3DGS pipeline, starting
from its splatting formulation and then exploring the main efforts in
addressing its limitations. Finally, we survey a range of applications that
leverage 3DGS for surface reconstruction, avatar modeling, animation, and
content generation-highlighting its efficient rendering and suitability for
feed-forward pipelines.

TL;DR: Online In-Context Distillation (ICD) enables small vision-language models to collaborate with stronger teacher models at inference time, using sparse demonstrations to bridge performance gaps without costly fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of deploying vision-language models in low-resource, budget-constrained settings where large models are impractical and small models require expensive fine-tuning to achieve competitive performance.

Method: Proposes an online In-Context Distillation framework where a small VLM collaborates with a stronger teacher model at inference time, using sparse demonstrations for knowledge distillation. Includes cross-modal demonstration selection, teacher test-time scaling to reduce noise, and student uncertainty conditioning to dynamically populate demonstration pools.

Result: Significantly boosts performance of small models (up to 33%) using scarce teacher annotations (as low as 4%), and competes with the teacher's zero-shot performance while being more practical for low-resource settings.

Conclusion: ICD provides an efficient alternative to fine-tuning for adapting small VLMs to budget-constrained environments, enabling them to leverage teacher knowledge through in-context learning while minimizing computational costs and teacher queries.

Abstract: As the field continues its push for ever more resources, this work turns the
spotlight on a critical question: how can vision-language models (VLMs) be
adapted to thrive in low-resource, budget-constrained settings? While large
VLMs offer strong performance, they are impractical to deploy in such settings.
Small VLMs, on the other hand, are efficient but typically require costly
fine-tuning to close the performance gap with larger models in the deployment
domain. Inspired by the in-context learning framework, we propose an online
In-Context Distillation (ICD) method, in which a small VLM collaborates with a
stronger teacher model at inference time, distilling its knowledge via sparse
demonstrations to efficiently bridge the gap between them. Our method is built
on an in-depth analysis that identifies the scale and the choice of models for
which vision-language ICL is currently feasible, and demonstrates the advantage
of ICL over fine-tuning under constrained compute budgets. We enhance our
method with a novel cross-modal demonstration selection strategy, teacher
test-time scaling to reduce noise, and student uncertainty conditioning to
dynamically populate a demonstration pool and minimize teacher queries. Our ICD
method significantly boosts the performance of small models (up to 33%) using
scarce teacher annotations (as low as 4%), and competes with the teacher's
zero-shot performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional V2X systems face challenges like high bandwidth demands and semantic loss, while natural language communication introduces new vulnerabilities including message loss, hallucinations, and adversarial attacks in collaborative driving.

Method: Developed a comprehensive taxonomy of attack strategies and introduced SafeCoop defense pipeline with semantic firewall, language-perception consistency checks, multi-source consensus, and agentic transformation for cross-frame spatial alignment.

Result: Evaluated in CARLA simulation across 32 critical scenarios, achieving 69.15% driving score improvement under malicious attacks and up to 67.32% F1 score for malicious detection.

Conclusion: Provides guidance for advancing research on safe, secure, and trustworthy language-driven collaboration in transportation systems, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed defense mechanisms.

Abstract: Collaborative driving systems leverage vehicle-to-everything (V2X)
communication across multiple agents to enhance driving safety and efficiency.
Traditional V2X systems take raw sensor data, neural features, or perception
results as communication media, which face persistent challenges, including
high bandwidth demands, semantic loss, and interoperability issues. Recent
advances investigate natural language as a promising medium, which can provide
semantic richness, decision-level reasoning, and human-machine interoperability
at significantly lower bandwidth. Despite great promise, this paradigm shift
also introduces new vulnerabilities within language communication, including
message loss, hallucinations, semantic manipulation, and adversarial attacks.
In this work, we present the first systematic study of full-stack safety and
security issues in natural-language-based collaborative driving. Specifically,
we develop a comprehensive taxonomy of attack strategies, including connection
disruption, relay/replay interference, content spoofing, and multi-connection
forgery. To mitigate these risks, we introduce an agentic defense pipeline,
which we call SafeCoop, that integrates a semantic firewall,
language-perception consistency checks, and multi-source consensus, enabled by
an agentic transformation function for cross-frame spatial alignment. We
systematically evaluate SafeCoop in closed-loop CARLA simulation across 32
critical scenarios, achieving 69.15% driving score improvement under malicious
attacks and up to 67.32% F1 score for malicious detection. This study provides
guidance for advancing research on safe, secure, and trustworthy

TL;DR: World-in-World is a new platform that benchmarks generative world models (WMs) for embodied AI tasks using closed-loop evaluation, showing that visual quality alone doesn't guarantee task success and controllability matters more.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current WM benchmarks focus on open-loop protocols and visual quality, leaving the core question unanswered: do WMs actually help agents succeed at embodied tasks? There's a need for closed-loop evaluation that mirrors real agent-environment interactions.

Method: Introduced World-in-World platform with unified online planning strategy and standardized action API. Curated four closed-loop environments to evaluate diverse WMs, prioritizing task success over visual quality. Also presented first data scaling law for WMs in embodied settings.

Result: Three key findings: (1) Visual quality alone doesn't guarantee task success - controllability matters more; (2) Scaling post-training with action-observation data is more effective than upgrading pretrained video generators; (3) More inference-time compute allows WMs to substantially improve closed-loop performance.

Conclusion: World-in-World provides the first comprehensive closed-loop benchmark for WMs in embodied AI, revealing that task-oriented evaluation and controllability are more important than visual quality for practical utility in decision making.

Abstract: Generative world models (WMs) can now simulate worlds with striking visual
realism, which naturally raises the question of whether they can endow embodied
agents with predictive perception for decision making. Progress on this
question has been limited by fragmented evaluation: most existing benchmarks
adopt open-loop protocols that emphasize visual quality in isolation, leaving
the core issue of embodied utility unresolved, i.e., do WMs actually help
agents succeed at embodied tasks? To address this gap, we introduce
World-in-World, the first open platform that benchmarks WMs in a closed-loop
world that mirrors real agent-environment interactions. World-in-World provides
a unified online planning strategy and a standardized action API, enabling
heterogeneous WMs for decision making. We curate four closed-loop environments
that rigorously evaluate diverse WMs, prioritize task success as the primary
metric, and move beyond the common focus on visual quality; we also present the
first data scaling law for world models in embodied settings. Our study
uncovers three surprises: (1) visual quality alone does not guarantee task
success, controllability matters more; (2) scaling post-training with
action-observation data is more effective than upgrading the pretrained video
generators; and (3) allocating more inference-time compute allows WMs to
substantially improve closed-loop performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing stereo vision methods struggle with lunar reconstruction due to lack of texture, difficult lighting variations, and atypical orbital trajectories. Deep learning models trained on human-scale datasets cannot be directly transferred to lunar conditions.

Method: Created LunarStereo dataset using ray tracing based on high-resolution topography and reflectance models. Fine-tuned MASt3R model on this dataset to adapt it to lunar domain.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real lunar data show significant improvements over zero-shot baselines for 3D surface reconstruction and relative pose estimation.

Conclusion: The approach enables robust cross-scale generalization in extraterrestrial environments and paves the way for improved lunar exploration capabilities.

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction of lunar surfaces is essential for space
exploration. However, existing stereo vision reconstruction methods struggle in
this context due to the Moon's lack of texture, difficult lighting variations,
and atypical orbital trajectories. State-of-the-art deep learning models,
trained on human-scale datasets, have rarely been tested on planetary imagery
and cannot be transferred directly to lunar conditions. To address this issue,
we introduce LunarStereo, the first open dataset of photorealistic stereo image
pairs of the Moon, simulated using ray tracing based on high-resolution
topography and reflectance models. It covers diverse altitudes, lighting
conditions, and viewing angles around the lunar South Pole, offering physically
grounded supervision for 3D reconstruction tasks. Based on this dataset, we
adapt the MASt3R model to the lunar domain through fine-tuning on LunarStereo.
We validate our approach through extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments on both synthetic and real lunar data, evaluating 3D surface
reconstruction and relative pose estimation. Extensive experiments on synthetic
and real lunar data validate the approach, demonstrating significant
improvements over zero-shot baselines and paving the way for robust cross-scale
generalization in extraterrestrial environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with occlusions and dynamic motion in crowded scenes, lacking adaptability to varying densities and interpretable anomaly indicators.

Method: Dual-pipeline framework combining head detection and dense optical flow to extract person-specific velocities, followed by hierarchical clustering into motion classes and percentile-based anomaly scoring.

Result: Effective real-time detection of diverse anomalous motion patterns in densely crowded environments.

Conclusion: VelocityNet addresses key challenges in crowd anomaly detection through interpretable velocity-based analysis and adaptable motion pattern classification.

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in crowded scenes is challenging due to severe
inter-person occlusions and highly dynamic, context-dependent motion patterns.
Existing approaches often struggle to adapt to varying crowd densities and lack
interpretable anomaly indicators. To address these limitations, we introduce
VelocityNet, a dual-pipeline framework that combines head detection and dense
optical flow to extract person-specific velocities. Hierarchical clustering
categorizes these velocities into semantic motion classes (halt, slow, normal,
and fast), and a percentile-based anomaly scoring system measures deviations
from learned normal patterns. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework in real-time detection of diverse anomalous motion patterns within
densely crowded environments.

Motivation: Current medical vision language models fail to jointly generate diagnostic text and segmentation masks, which limits their clinical application value since practitioners need both modalities simultaneously for effective diagnosis.

Method: First created RadDiagSeg-D dataset combining abnormality detection, diagnosis, and multi-target segmentation, then developed RadDiagSeg-M model capable of joint abnormality detection, diagnosis, and flexible segmentation across multiple imaging modalities.

Result: RadDiagSeg-M demonstrates strong performance across all components of multi-target text-and-mask generation, providing highly informative and clinically useful outputs that enrich contextual information for assistive diagnosis.

Conclusion: The proposed approach establishes a robust baseline for joint text-and-mask generation in medical vision-language models, effectively addressing the clinical need for simultaneous diagnostic text and segmentation mask generation.

Abstract: Most current medical vision language models struggle to jointly generate
diagnostic text and pixel-level segmentation masks in response to complex
visual questions. This represents a major limitation towards clinical
application, as assistive systems that fail to provide both modalities
simultaneously offer limited value to medical practitioners. To alleviate this
limitation, we first introduce RadDiagSeg-D, a dataset combining abnormality
detection, diagnosis, and multi-target segmentation into a unified and
hierarchical task. RadDiagSeg-D covers multiple imaging modalities and is
precisely designed to support the development of models that produce
descriptive text and corresponding segmentation masks in tandem. Subsequently,
we leverage the dataset to propose a novel vision-language model, RadDiagSeg-M,
capable of joint abnormality detection, diagnosis, and flexible segmentation.
RadDiagSeg-M provides highly informative and clinically useful outputs,
effectively addressing the need to enrich contextual information for assistive
diagnosis. Finally, we benchmark RadDiagSeg-M and showcase its strong
performance across all components involved in the task of multi-target
text-and-mask generation, establishing a robust and competitive baseline.

### [29] [EMA-SAM: Exponential Moving-average for SAM-based PTMC Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18213)
*Maryam Dialameh,Hossein Rajabzadeh,Jung Suk Sim,Hyock Ju Kwon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EMA-SAM is a lightweight extension of SAM-2 that adds a confidence-weighted exponential moving average pointer to achieve stable tumor tracking in ultrasound videos, improving segmentation accuracy while maintaining real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) is increasingly managed with radio-frequency ablation (RFA), but accurate lesion segmentation in ultrasound videos remains challenging due to low contrast, probe-induced motion, and heat-related artifacts. SAM-2's frame-independent design yields unstable predictions and temporal drift in interventional ultrasound.

Method: EMA-SAM incorporates a confidence-weighted exponential moving average pointer into SAM-2's memory bank, providing a stable latent prototype of the tumor across frames. This preserves temporal coherence through probe pressure and bubble occlusion while rapidly adapting when clear evidence reappears.

Result: On PTMC-RFA dataset (124 minutes, 13 patients), EMA-SAM improved maxDice from 0.82 to 0.86 and maxIoU from 0.72 to 0.76, while reducing false positives by 29%. On external benchmarks, it achieved consistent gains of 2-5 Dice points over SAM-2. The EMA pointer adds <0.1% FLOPs, maintaining real-time throughput of ~30 FPS.

Conclusion: EMA-SAM establishes a robust and efficient framework for stable tumor tracking, bridging the gap between foundation models and the stringent demands of interventional ultrasound.

Abstract: Papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) is increasingly managed with
radio-frequency ablation (RFA), yet accurate lesion segmentation in ultrasound
videos remains difficult due to low contrast, probe-induced motion, and
heat-related artifacts. The recent Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM-2) generalizes
well to static images, but its frame-independent design yields unstable
predictions and temporal drift in interventional ultrasound. We introduce
\textbf{EMA-SAM}, a lightweight extension of SAM-2 that incorporates a
confidence-weighted exponential moving average pointer into the memory bank,
providing a stable latent prototype of the tumour across frames. This design
preserves temporal coherence through probe pressure and bubble occlusion while
rapidly adapting once clear evidence reappears. On our curated PTMC-RFA dataset
(124 minutes, 13 patients), EMA-SAM improves \emph{maxDice} from 0.82 (SAM-2)
to 0.86 and \emph{maxIoU} from 0.72 to 0.76, while reducing false positives by
29\%. On external benchmarks, including VTUS and colonoscopy video polyp
datasets, EMA-SAM achieves consistent gains of 2--5 Dice points over SAM-2.
Importantly, the EMA pointer adds \textless0.1\% FLOPs, preserving real-time
throughput of $\sim$30\,FPS on a single A100 GPU. These results establish
EMA-SAM as a robust and efficient framework for stable tumour tracking,
bridging the gap between foundation models and the stringent demands of

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLSU is a framework that systematically evaluates multimodal safety by analyzing joint image-text understanding failures, revealing that models perform well on unimodal safety signals but degrade significantly when combinatorial reasoning is required.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety evaluation methods treat vision and language inputs separately, missing risks from joint interpretation where benign content becomes harmful in combination. Existing approaches also fail to distinguish clearly unsafe content from borderline cases.

Method: A comprehensive framework using fine-grained severity classification and combinatorial analysis across 17 safety patterns, with a multi-stage pipeline using real-world images and human annotation to construct a benchmark of 8,187 samples spanning 15 harm categories.

Result: Models achieve 90%+ accuracy on unimodal safety signals but degrade to 20-55% when joint image-text reasoning is required. 34% of joint classification errors occur despite correct individual modality classification. Models struggle to balance refusal of unsafe content while engaging with borderline cases.

Conclusion: The framework exposes weaknesses in joint image-text understanding and alignment gaps in current models, providing a critical test bed for research on robust vision-language safety.

Abstract: Safety evaluation of multimodal foundation models often treats vision and
language inputs separately, missing risks from joint interpretation where
benign content becomes harmful in combination. Existing approaches also fail to
distinguish clearly unsafe content from borderline cases, leading to
problematic over-blocking or under-refusal of genuinely harmful content. We
present Vision Language Safety Understanding (VLSU), a comprehensive framework
to systematically evaluate multimodal safety through fine-grained severity
classification and combinatorial analysis across 17 distinct safety patterns.
Using a multi-stage pipeline with real-world images and human annotation, we
construct a large-scale benchmark of 8,187 samples spanning 15 harm categories.
Our evaluation of eleven state-of-the-art models reveals systematic joint
understanding failures: while models achieve 90%-plus accuracy on clear
unimodal safety signals, performance degrades substantially to 20-55% when
joint image-text reasoning is required to determine the safety label. Most
critically, 34% of errors in joint image-text safety classification occur
despite correct classification of the individual modalities, further
demonstrating absent compositional reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we
find that models struggle to balance refusing unsafe content while still
responding to borderline cases that deserve engagement. For example, we find
that instruction framing can reduce the over-blocking rate on borderline
content from 62.4% to 10.4% in Gemini-1.5, but only at the cost of
under-refusing on unsafe content with refusal rate dropping from 90.8% to
53.9%. Overall, our framework exposes weaknesses in joint image-text
understanding and alignment gaps in current models, and provides a critical
test bed to enable the next milestones in research on robust vision-language
safety.

*Xinhao Cai,Liulei Li,Gensheng Pei,Tao Chen,Jinshan Pan,Yazhou Yao,Wenguan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A generation-based debiasing framework for object detection that addresses biases by using representation scores to identify gaps, creating unbiased layouts, and employing generative alignment between detector and generator for high-quality synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior debiasing methods are limited by representation diversity, naive generative augmentation preserves biases, and current layout-to-image synthesis lacks fidelity and control for complex scenes.

Method: Introduces representation score (RS) to diagnose representational gaps beyond frequency, creates unbiased layouts, replaces text prompts with visual blueprints, and uses generative alignment strategy between detector and generator.

Result: Significantly narrows performance gap for underrepresented object groups - improves large/rare instances by 4.4/3.6 mAP over baseline, and surpasses prior L2I synthesis models by 15.9 mAP for layout accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses object detection biases through representation-aware generation and generative alignment, achieving substantial improvements for underrepresented groups.

Abstract: This paper presents a generation-based debiasing framework for object
detection. Prior debiasing methods are often limited by the representation
diversity of samples, while naive generative augmentation often preserves the
biases it aims to solve. Moreover, our analysis reveals that simply generating
more data for rare classes is suboptimal due to two core issues: i) instance
frequency is an incomplete proxy for the true data needs of a model, and ii)
current layout-to-image synthesis lacks the fidelity and control to generate
high-quality, complex scenes. To overcome this, we introduce the representation
score (RS) to diagnose representational gaps beyond mere frequency, guiding the
creation of new, unbiased layouts. To ensure high-quality synthesis, we replace
ambiguous text prompts with a precise visual blueprint and employ a generative
alignment strategy, which fosters communication between the detector and
generator. Our method significantly narrows the performance gap for
underrepresented object groups, \eg, improving large/rare instances by 4.4/3.6
mAP over the baseline, and surpassing prior L2I synthesis models by 15.9 mAP
for layout accuracy in generated images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepSeek-OCR compresses long contexts via optical 2D mapping using DeepEncoder and DeepSeek3B-MoE-A570M decoder, achieving high OCR accuracy with low vision tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate feasibility of compressing long contexts via optical 2D mapping for applications like historical document compression and memory mechanisms in LLMs.

Method: Uses DeepEncoder to maintain low activations under high-resolution input with high compression ratios, and DeepSeek3B-MoE-A570M as decoder for OCR tasks.

Result: Achieves 97% OCR precision at <10x compression ratio, 60% at 20x ratio. Outperforms GOT-OCR2.0 with 100 tokens and MinerU2.0 with <800 tokens. Can process 200k+ pages/day on single A100-40G.

Conclusion: Shows considerable promise for long-context compression research and has high practical value for LLM/VLM training data generation.

Abstract: We present DeepSeek-OCR as an initial investigation into the feasibility of
compressing long contexts via optical 2D mapping. DeepSeek-OCR consists of two
components: DeepEncoder and DeepSeek3B-MoE-A570M as the decoder. Specifically,
DeepEncoder serves as the core engine, designed to maintain low activations
under high-resolution input while achieving high compression ratios to ensure
an optimal and manageable number of vision tokens. Experiments show that when
the number of text tokens is within 10 times that of vision tokens (i.e., a
compression ratio < 10x), the model can achieve decoding (OCR) precision of
97%. Even at a compression ratio of 20x, the OCR accuracy still remains at
about 60%. This shows considerable promise for research areas such as
historical long-context compression and memory forgetting mechanisms in LLMs.
Beyond this, DeepSeek-OCR also demonstrates high practical value. On
OmniDocBench, it surpasses GOT-OCR2.0 (256 tokens/page) using only 100 vision
tokens, and outperforms MinerU2.0 (6000+ tokens per page on average) while
utilizing fewer than 800 vision tokens. In production, DeepSeek-OCR can
generate training data for LLMs/VLMs at a scale of 200k+ pages per day (a
single A100-40G). Codes and model weights are publicly accessible at

*Ajinkya Khoche,Gergő László Nagy,Maciej Wozniak,Thomas Gustafsson,Patric Jensfelt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BlendCLIP is a multimodal pretraining framework that bridges the synthetic-to-real gap in 3D object classification by strategically combining synthetic CAD data with real-world LiDAR scans using a curriculum-based data mixing strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot 3D object classification faces a significant domain gap between synthetic training data and real-world LiDAR scans. Methods trained only on synthetic data fail in outdoor scenes, while real-data-only approaches lack semantic diversity for rare objects.

Method: Proposes a pipeline to generate object-level triplets (point cloud, image, text) from real-world driving data, and introduces a curriculum-based data mixing strategy that first trains on semantically rich synthetic CAD data before progressively adapting to real-world scans.

Result: Highly label-efficient: adding just 1.5% real-world samples per batch boosts zero-shot accuracy on nuScenes by 27%. Achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes and TruckScenes, improving by 19.3% over prior methods while maintaining strong generalization on synthetic benchmarks.

Conclusion: Effective domain adaptation, not full-scale real-world annotation, is key to robust open-vocabulary 3D perception. The approach demonstrates that strategic combination of synthetic and real data can overcome the synthetic-to-real gap in 3D object classification.

Abstract: Zero-shot 3D object classification is crucial for real-world applications
like autonomous driving, however it is often hindered by a significant domain
gap between the synthetic data used for training and the sparse, noisy LiDAR
scans encountered in the real-world. Current methods trained solely on
synthetic data fail to generalize to outdoor scenes, while those trained only
on real data lack the semantic diversity to recognize rare or unseen objects.
  We introduce BlendCLIP, a multimodal pretraining framework that bridges this
synthetic-to-real gap by strategically combining the strengths of both domains.
We first propose a pipeline to generate a large-scale dataset of object-level
triplets -- consisting of a point cloud, image, and text description -- mined
directly from real-world driving data and human annotated 3D boxes. Our core
contribution is a curriculum-based data mixing strategy that first grounds the
model in the semantically rich synthetic CAD data before progressively adapting
it to the specific characteristics of real-world scans.
  Our experiments show that our approach is highly label-efficient: introducing
as few as 1.5\% real-world samples per batch into training boosts zero-shot
accuracy on the nuScenes benchmark by 27\%. Consequently, our final model
achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging outdoor datasets like
nuScenes and TruckScenes, improving over the best prior method by 19.3\% on
nuScenes, while maintaining strong generalization on diverse synthetic
benchmarks. Our findings demonstrate that effective domain adaptation, not
full-scale real-world annotation, is the key to unlocking robust
open-vocabulary 3D perception. Our code and dataset will be released upon
acceptance on https://github.com/kesu1/BlendCLIP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current semantic Gaussian splatting approaches suffer from insufficient contextual cues for individual masks during preprocessing and inconsistencies/missing details when fusing multi-view features from 2D models.

Method: Two main modules: Context-Aware Feature Extraction (augments each mask with rich semantic context) and Attention-Driven Feature Aggregation (selectively fuses multi-view features to mitigate alignment errors and incompleteness).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary 3D Gaussian segmentation, outperforming existing baselines by a large margin on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates robustness and generality, marking a significant step forward in 3D scene understanding for autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality applications.

Abstract: Understanding 3D scenes is pivotal for autonomous driving, robotics, and
augmented reality. Recent semantic Gaussian Splatting approaches leverage
large-scale 2D vision models to project 2D semantic features onto 3D scenes.
However, they suffer from two major limitations: (1) insufficient contextual
cues for individual masks during preprocessing and (2) inconsistencies and
missing details when fusing multi-view features from these 2D models. In this
paper, we introduce \textbf{OpenInsGaussian}, an \textbf{Open}-vocabulary
\textbf{Ins}tance \textbf{Gaussian} segmentation framework with Context-aware
Cross-view Fusion. Our method consists of two modules: Context-Aware Feature
Extraction, which augments each mask with rich semantic context, and

features to mitigate alignment errors and incompleteness. Through extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets, OpenInsGaussian achieves state-of-the-art
results in open-vocabulary 3D Gaussian segmentation, outperforming existing

*Xiang Zhang,Suping Wu,Weibin Qiu,Zhaocheng Jin,Sheng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a hyperbolic space learning method for 3D human mesh recovery from videos that captures hierarchical structure better than Euclidean methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video-based 3D human mesh recovery methods learn in Euclidean space, which struggles to capture the natural hierarchical structure of human bodies, leading to inaccurate reconstructions.

Method: Uses temporal motion prior extraction and hyperbolic space optimization learning strategy with hyperbolic mesh optimization loss to capture hierarchical relationships and improve mesh accuracy.

Result: Extensive experiments on large public datasets show superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic space learning effectively captures hierarchical human body structure and improves 3D human mesh recovery accuracy from videos.

Abstract: 3D human meshes show a natural hierarchical structure (like
torso-limbs-fingers). But existing video-based 3D human mesh recovery methods
usually learn mesh features in Euclidean space. It's hard to catch this
hierarchical structure accurately. So wrong human meshes are reconstructed. To
solve this problem, we propose a hyperbolic space learning method leveraging
temporal motion prior for recovering 3D human meshes from videos. First, we
design a temporal motion prior extraction module. This module extracts the
temporal motion features from the input 3D pose sequences and image feature
sequences respectively. Then it combines them into the temporal motion prior.
In this way, it can strengthen the ability to express features in the temporal
motion dimension. Since data representation in non-Euclidean space has been
proved to effectively capture hierarchical relationships in real-world datasets
(especially in hyperbolic space), we further design a hyperbolic space
optimization learning strategy. This strategy uses the temporal motion prior
information to assist learning, and uses 3D pose and pose motion information
respectively in the hyperbolic space to optimize and learn the mesh features.
Then, we combine the optimized results to get an accurate and smooth human
mesh. Besides, to make the optimization learning process of human meshes in
hyperbolic space stable and effective, we propose a hyperbolic mesh
optimization loss. Extensive experimental results on large publicly available
datasets indicate superiority in comparison with most state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: UWBench is a comprehensive underwater vision-language benchmark with 15,003 high-resolution images, 15,281 object referring expressions, and 124,983 QA pairs, designed to evaluate VLMs on underwater scene understanding through captioning, visual grounding, and VQA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs excel in natural scenes but struggle with underwater environments due to unique challenges like light attenuation, color distortion, and specialized marine knowledge requirements.

Method: Created UWBench dataset with diverse underwater images and human-verified annotations, then established three benchmarks: detailed image captioning, visual grounding, and visual question answering for underwater contexts.

Result: Experiments show current VLMs perform poorly on underwater understanding tasks, indicating significant room for improvement in this domain.

Conclusion: UWBench provides essential resources to advance vision-language research for underwater applications in marine science, ecological monitoring, and autonomous exploration.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
natural scene understanding, yet their application to underwater environments
remains largely unexplored. Underwater imagery presents unique challenges
including severe light attenuation, color distortion, and suspended particle
scattering, while requiring specialized knowledge of marine ecosystems and
organism taxonomy. To bridge this gap, we introduce UWBench, a comprehensive
benchmark specifically designed for underwater vision-language understanding.
UWBench comprises 15,003 high-resolution underwater images captured across
diverse aquatic environments, encompassing oceans, coral reefs, and deep-sea
habitats. Each image is enriched with human-verified annotations including
15,281 object referring expressions that precisely describe marine organisms
and underwater structures, and 124,983 question-answer pairs covering diverse
reasoning capabilities from object recognition to ecological relationship
understanding. The dataset captures rich variations in visibility, lighting
conditions, and water turbidity, providing a realistic testbed for model
evaluation. Based on UWBench, we establish three comprehensive benchmarks:
detailed image captioning for generating ecologically informed scene
descriptions, visual grounding for precise localization of marine organisms,
and visual question answering for multimodal reasoning about underwater
environments. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs demonstrate that
underwater understanding remains challenging, with substantial room for
improvement. Our benchmark provides essential resources for advancing
vision-language research in underwater contexts and supporting applications in
marine science, ecological monitoring, and autonomous underwater exploration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage network for 3D human mesh recovery that uses latent information and low-dimensional learning to address limb misalignment and computational efficiency issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D human mesh recovery methods fail to fully exploit latent information (human motion, shape alignment), leading to limb misalignment and insufficient local details. Attention-based methods for mesh-vertex interactions are computationally expensive.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) Extract global and local information from low/high-frequency image components into hybrid latent frequency domain features to enhance 2D-to-3D pose learning. (2) Use low-dimensional mesh-pose interaction through dimensionality reduction and parallel optimization to reduce computational costs while maintaining accuracy.

Result: Extensive experiments on large public datasets show superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses limb misalignment and computational efficiency issues in 3D human mesh recovery through latent information exploitation and low-dimensional optimization.

Abstract: Existing 3D human mesh recovery methods often fail to fully exploit the
latent information (e.g., human motion, shape alignment), leading to issues
with limb misalignment and insufficient local details in the reconstructed
human mesh (especially in complex scenes). Furthermore, the performance
improvement gained by modelling mesh vertices and pose node interactions using
attention mechanisms comes at a high computational cost. To address these
issues, we propose a two-stage network for human mesh recovery based on latent
information and low dimensional learning. Specifically, the first stage of the
network fully excavates global (e.g., the overall shape alignment) and local
(e.g., textures, detail) information from the low and high-frequency components
of image features and aggregates this information into a hybrid latent
frequency domain feature. This strategy effectively extracts latent
information. Subsequently, utilizing extracted hybrid latent frequency domain
features collaborates to enhance 2D poses to 3D learning. In the second stage,
with the assistance of hybrid latent features, we model the interaction
learning between the rough 3D human mesh template and the 3D pose, optimizing
the pose and shape of the human mesh. Unlike existing mesh pose interaction
methods, we design a low-dimensional mesh pose interaction method through
dimensionality reduction and parallel optimization that significantly reduces
computational costs without sacrificing reconstruction accuracy. Extensive
experimental results on large publicly available datasets indicate superiority
compared to the most state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: TreeFedDG is a novel tree topology framework for federated domain generalization in medical imaging that addresses global drift through hierarchical aggregation, style mixing, and progressive fusion strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional federated learning methods fail to handle information aggregation imbalance in cross-domain medical imaging scenarios, leading to Global Drift problems that degrade model generalization performance.

Method: Proposes TreeFedDG framework with: 1) hierarchical parameter aggregation using tree topology, 2) FedStyle parameter difference-based style mixing, 3) progressive personalized fusion strategy, and 4) feature similarity-guided ensemble inference.

Result: Extensive experiments on two public datasets show TreeFedDG outperforms state-of-the-art domain generalization approaches and achieves better cross-domain performance balance.

Conclusion: The proposed TreeFedDG framework effectively addresses global drift in federated domain generalization for medical imaging through its hierarchical structure and novel aggregation strategies.

Abstract: In medical image segmentation tasks, Domain Generalization (DG) under the
Federated Learning (FL) framework is crucial for addressing challenges related
to privacy protection and data heterogeneity. However, traditional federated
learning methods fail to account for the imbalance in information aggregation
across clients in cross-domain scenarios, leading to the Global Drift (GD)
problem and a consequent decline in model generalization performance. This
motivates us to delve deeper and define a new critical issue: global drift in
federated domain generalization for medical imaging (FedDG-GD). In this paper,
we propose a novel tree topology framework called TreeFedDG. First, starting
from the distributed characteristics of medical images, we design a
hierarchical parameter aggregation method based on a tree-structured topology
to suppress deviations in the global model direction. Second, we introduce a
parameter difference-based style mixing method (FedStyle), which enforces
mixing among clients with maximum parameter differences to enhance robustness
against drift. Third, we develop a a progressive personalized fusion strategy
during model distribution, ensuring a balance between knowledge transfer and
personalized features. Finally, during the inference phase, we use feature
similarity to guide the retrieval of the most relevant model chain from the
tree structure for ensemble decision-making, thereby fully leveraging the
advantages of hierarchical knowledge. We conducted extensive experiments on two
publicly available datasets. The results demonstrate that our method
outperforms other state-of-the-art domain generalization approaches in these
challenging tasks and achieves better balance in cross-domain performance.

*Xueyi Chen,Keda Tao,Kele Shao,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StreamingTOM is a training-free framework that addresses both pre-LLM and post-LLM bottlenecks in streaming video VLMs through causal temporal reduction and online quantized memory, achieving significant efficiency gains while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Streaming video VLMs face causality constraints (no future frame access) and accumulation issues (unbounded token growth), but existing methods only regulate post-LLM kv-cache while leaving costly pre-LLM prefill unchanged.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Causal Temporal Reduction imposes fixed per-frame budget and selects tokens based on adjacent-frame changes and token saliency, reducing prefill cost; 2) Online Quantized Memory stores tokens in 4-bit format, retrieves relevant groups on demand, and dequantizes them to keep active kv-cache bounded.

Result: Achieves 15.7× kv-cache compression, 1.2× lower peak memory, and 2× faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA. Maintains state-of-the-art accuracy with 63.8% on offline benchmarks and 55.8%/3.7 on RVS.

Conclusion: The two-stage approach provides practical benefits for efficient streaming video understanding with bounded growth, demonstrating the importance of addressing both pre-LLM and post-LLM bottlenecks.

Abstract: Unlike offline processing, streaming video vision-language models face two
fundamental constraints: causality and accumulation. Causality prevents access
to future frames that offline methods exploit, while accumulation causes tokens
to grow unbounded, creating efficiency bottlenecks. However, existing
approaches only regulate post-LLM kv-cache, leaving costly pre-LLM prefill
unchanged. We introduce StreamingTOM, a training-free, plug-and-play two-stage
framework that addresses both pre-LLM and post-LLM bottlenecks with predictable
latency. Causal Temporal Reduction imposes a fixed per-frame budget and selects
tokens based on adjacent-frame changes and token saliency, drastically reducing
per-frame prefill cost by processing only a compact subset of visual tokens per
frame instead of all visual tokens. Online Quantized Memory stores tokens in
4-bit format, retrieves relevant groups on demand, and dequantizes them,
keeping the active kv-cache bounded regardless of stream length. Experiments
demonstrate our method achieves $15.7\times$ kv-cache compression, $1.2\times$
lower peak memory and $2\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA.
StreamingTOM maintains state-of-the-art accuracy among training-free methods
with an average of $63.8\%$ on offline benchmarks and $55.8\%/3.7$ on RVS.
These results highlight the practical benefits of our two-stage approach for
efficient streaming video understanding with bounded growth.

*Vishal Vinod*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a method for identity-preserving 3D face editing using few-shot learning to estimate latent space directions that enable photorealistic attribute modifications while maintaining view consistency across multiple poses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identity preserving editing for 3D faces is challenging due to view consistency requirements and the trade-off between editability in low-resolution vs inflexibility in high-resolution. Current methods require large-scale attribute labelled datasets.

Method: The method builds on 3D-aware deep generative models and 2D portrait editing techniques to perform efficient few-shot identity preserving attribute editing. It uses just ten or fewer labelled images per attribute to estimate edit directions in latent space, leveraging existing face datasets with masks for synthetic images.

Result: The approach enables 3D-aware attribute editing using minimal training data, demonstrating that few-shot learning is sufficient for estimating edit directions. The method also shows linearity of edits through sequential editing and investigates continuous style manifolds for 3D consistent face aging.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses constraints in 3D face editing by identifying latent space directions for photorealistic edits using minimal training data, enabling efficient identity-preserving attribute modifications with view consistency.

Abstract: Identity preserving editing of faces is a generative task that enables
modifying the illumination, adding/removing eyeglasses, face aging, editing
hairstyles, modifying expression etc., while preserving the identity of the
face. Recent progress in 2D generative models have enabled photorealistic
editing of faces using simple techniques leveraging the compositionality in
GANs. However, identity preserving editing for 3D faces with a given set of
attributes is a challenging task as the generative model must reason about view
consistency from multiple poses and render a realistic 3D face. Further, 3D
portrait editing requires large-scale attribute labelled datasets and presents
a trade-off between editability in low-resolution and inflexibility to editing
in high resolution. In this work, we aim to alleviate some of the constraints
in editing 3D faces by identifying latent space directions that correspond to
photorealistic edits. To address this, we present a method that builds on
recent advancements in 3D-aware deep generative models and 2D portrait editing
techniques to perform efficient few-shot identity preserving attribute editing
for 3D-aware generative models. We aim to show from experimental results that
using just ten or fewer labelled images of an attribute is sufficient to
estimate edit directions in the latent space that correspond to 3D-aware
attribute editing. In this work, we leverage an existing face dataset with
masks to obtain the synthetic images for few attribute examples required for
estimating the edit directions. Further, to demonstrate the linearity of edits,
we investigate one-shot stylization by performing sequential editing and use
the (2D) Attribute Style Manipulation (ASM) technique to investigate a
continuous style manifold for 3D consistent identity preserving face aging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based monocular depth estimation methods excel at relative depth but struggle with absolute metric depth due to scale ambiguities in single-image scenarios.

Method: Reframe depth estimation as an inverse problem using pretrained latent diffusion models conditioned on RGB images, combined with stereo-based geometric constraints to learn scale and shift for accurate depth recovery.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios with translucent and specular surfaces, without requiring retraining.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free solution seamlessly integrates into existing frameworks and generalizes well across indoor, outdoor, and complex environments.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for metric depth estimation that enhances
pretrained diffusion-based monocular depth estimation (DB-MDE) models with
stereo vision guidance. While existing DB-MDE methods excel at predicting
relative depth, estimating absolute metric depth remains challenging due to
scale ambiguities in single-image scenarios. To address this, we reframe depth
estimation as an inverse problem, leveraging pretrained latent diffusion models
(LDMs) conditioned on RGB images, combined with stereo-based geometric
constraints, to learn scale and shift for accurate depth recovery. Our
training-free solution seamlessly integrates into existing DB-MDE frameworks
and generalizes across indoor, outdoor, and complex environments. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach matches or surpasses state-of-the-art
methods, particularly in challenging scenarios involving translucent and
specular surfaces, all without requiring retraining.

*Lehan Wang,Yi Qin,Honglong Yang,Xiaomeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Med-RwR is a multimodal medical reasoning framework that enhances MLLMs by actively retrieving external knowledge during diagnosis, using reinforcement learning and confidence-driven image re-retrieval to improve accuracy and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical MLLMs rely solely on internal knowledge, leading to hallucinations and factual inaccuracies when encountering cases beyond their training scope. Current RAG methods are limited to unimodal LLMs and neglect visual information.

Method: Proposes Med-RwR framework with two-stage reinforcement learning strategy and tailored rewards to stimulate model to leverage both visual diagnostic findings and textual clinical information. Includes Confidence-Driven Image Re-retrieval (CDIR) for test-time scaling when low confidence is detected.

Result: Significant improvements over baseline models on various medical benchmarks. Demonstrates remarkable generalizability with 8.8% performance gain on EchoCardiography Benchmark (ECBench) despite training data scarcity.

Conclusion: Med-RwR effectively enhances reasoning capabilities through external knowledge integration and shows strong performance in unfamiliar medical domains, proving the value of multimodal retrieval-augmented reasoning in medical applications.

Abstract: Incentivizing the reasoning ability of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) is essential for medical applications to transparently analyze medical
scans and provide reliable diagnosis. However, existing medical MLLMs rely
solely on internal knowledge during reasoning, leading to hallucinated
reasoning and factual inaccuracies when encountering cases beyond their
training scope. Although recent Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
methods elicit the medical model's proactive retrieval ability during
reasoning, they are confined to unimodal LLMs, neglecting the crucial visual
information during reasoning and retrieval. Consequently, we propose the first
Multimodal Medical Reasoning-with-Retrieval framework, Med-RwR, which actively
retrieves external knowledge by querying observed symptoms or domain-specific
medical concepts during reasoning. Specifically, we design a two-stage
reinforcement learning strategy with tailored rewards that stimulate the model
to leverage both visual diagnostic findings and textual clinical information
for effective retrieval. Building on this foundation, we further propose a
Confidence-Driven Image Re-retrieval (CDIR) method for test-time scaling when
low prediction confidence is detected. Evaluation on various public medical
benchmarks demonstrates Med-RwR's significant improvements over baseline
models, proving the effectiveness of enhancing reasoning capabilities with
external knowledge integration. Furthermore, Med-RwR demonstrates remarkable
generalizability to unfamiliar domains, evidenced by 8.8% performance gain on
our proposed EchoCardiography Benchmark (ECBench), despite the scarcity of
echocardiography data in the training corpus. Our data, model, and codes will
be made publicly available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/Med-RwR.

TL;DR: Native-resolution training and inference significantly improve biomedical MLLM performance, while resolution misalignment degrades it; mixed-resolution training effectively balances computational constraints with performance requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most multimodal large language models are designed for low-resolution general-purpose images, risking critical information loss in biomedical applications where high-resolution analysis is essential.

Method: Investigated how image resolution affects MLLM performance through native-resolution training/inference experiments, resolution misalignment studies, and mixed-resolution training approaches.

Result: Native-resolution training and inference significantly improved performance across multiple biomedical tasks, while misalignment between training and inference resolutions severely degraded performance.

Conclusion: Prioritize native-resolution inference and mixed-resolution datasets to optimize biomedical MLLMs for transformative impact in scientific research and clinical applications.

Abstract: Imaging technologies are fundamental to biomedical research and modern
medicine, requiring analysis of high-resolution images across various
modalities. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise for
biomedical image analysis, most are designed for low-resolution images from
general-purpose datasets, risking critical information loss. We investigate how
image resolution affects MLLM performance in biomedical applications and
demonstrate that: (1) native-resolution training and inference significantly
improve performance across multiple tasks, (2) misalignment between training
and inference resolutions severely degrades performance, and (3)
mixed-resolution training effectively mitigates misalignment and balances
computational constraints with performance requirements. Based on these
findings, we recommend prioritizing native-resolution inference and
mixed-resolution datasets to optimize biomedical MLLMs for transformative
impact in scientific research and clinical applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniNWM is an omniscient panoramic navigation world model that addresses state, action, and reward dimensions in autonomous driving through panoramic video generation, precise action control via Plucker ray-maps, and occupancy-grounded reward functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autonomous driving world models are limited in state modalities, video sequence length, action control precision, and reward awareness, creating a need for a comprehensive solution that addresses all three core dimensions.

Method: OmniNWM uses panoramic video generation for multiple state modalities (RGB, semantics, depth, 3D occupancy), employs normalized panoramic Plucker ray-maps for precise action control, and leverages generated 3D occupancy for rule-based dense rewards.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance in video generation, control accuracy, and long-horizon stability, providing a reliable closed-loop evaluation framework through occupancy-grounded rewards.

Conclusion: OmniNWM successfully unifies state, action, and reward dimensions in a single framework, demonstrating superior performance across multiple metrics and enabling comprehensive autonomous driving world modeling.

Abstract: Autonomous driving world models are expected to work effectively across three
core dimensions: state, action, and reward. Existing models, however, are
typically restricted to limited state modalities, short video sequences,
imprecise action control, and a lack of reward awareness. In this paper, we
introduce OmniNWM, an omniscient panoramic navigation world model that
addresses all three dimensions within a unified framework. For state, OmniNWM
jointly generates panoramic videos of RGB, semantics, metric depth, and 3D
occupancy. A flexible forcing strategy enables high-quality long-horizon
auto-regressive generation. For action, we introduce a normalized panoramic
Plucker ray-map representation that encodes input trajectories into pixel-level
signals, enabling highly precise and generalizable control over panoramic video
generation. Regarding reward, we move beyond learning reward functions with
external image-based models: instead, we leverage the generated 3D occupancy to
directly define rule-based dense rewards for driving compliance and safety.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniNWM achieves state-of-the-art
performance in video generation, control accuracy, and long-horizon stability,
while providing a reliable closed-loop evaluation framework through
occupancy-grounded rewards. Project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ATED is a training-free ensemble method that reduces object hallucination in LVLMs by dynamically weighting predictions from multiple models during inference based on uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs suffer from object hallucination (describing non-existent objects), and existing solutions have limitations in scalability, adaptability, and model independence.

Method: Adaptive Token Ensemble Decoding (ATED) - a token-level ensemble framework that aggregates predictions from multiple LVLMs using uncertainty-based weights and integrates diverse decoding paths.

Result: ATED significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on hallucination detection benchmarks, reducing hallucination without compromising fluency or relevance.

Conclusion: Adaptive ensembling is a promising direction for improving LVLM robustness in high-stakes applications, offering a training-free solution to hallucination problems.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently achieved impressive
results in multimodal tasks such as image captioning and visual question
answering. However, they remain prone to object hallucination -- generating
descriptions of nonexistent or misidentified objects. Prior work has partially
mitigated this via auxiliary training objectives or external modules, but
challenges remain in terms of scalability, adaptability, and model
independence. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Token Ensemble
Decoding (ATED), a training-free, token-level ensemble framework that mitigates
hallucination by aggregating predictions from multiple LVLMs during inference.
ATED dynamically computes uncertainty-based weights for each model, reflecting
their reliability at each decoding step. It also integrates diverse decoding
paths to improve contextual grounding and semantic consistency. Experiments on
standard hallucination detection benchmarks demonstrate that ATED significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing hallucination without
compromising fluency or relevance. Our findings highlight the benefits of
adaptive ensembling and point to a promising direction for improving LVLM
robustness in high-stakes applications. The code is available at

*Gao Yu Lee,Tanmoy Dam,Md Meftahul Ferdaus,Daniel Puiu Poenar,Vu Duong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ATTBHFA-Net, a novel few-shot learning method using Bhattacharyya-Hellinger distance for robust feature aggregation in disaster image classification, addressing data scarcity and high intra-class variation challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the critical need for accurate disaster image classification to support rescue operations, overcoming challenges of limited disaster imagery data and high intra-class variation/inter-class similarity in disaster contexts.

Method: Introduces Attention-based Bhattacharyya-Hellinger Feature Aggregation Network (ATTBHFA-Net) that combines Bhattacharyya coefficient and Hellinger distances to compare feature probability distributions, with a novel contrastive loss function operating over distributions rather than embedded features.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance on four FSL benchmarks and two disaster image datasets, showing improved generalization and effectiveness compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: ATTBHFA-Net provides an effective solution for few-shot disaster image classification by leveraging distribution-based feature aggregation, offering practical benefits for real-world disaster response applications.

Abstract: The increasing frequency of natural and human-induced disasters necessitates
advanced visual recognition techniques capable of analyzing critical
photographic data. With progress in artificial intelligence and resilient
computational systems, rapid and accurate disaster classification has become
crucial for efficient rescue operations. However, visual recognition in
disaster contexts faces significant challenges due to limited and diverse data
from the difficulties in collecting and curating comprehensive, high-quality
disaster imagery. Few-Shot Learning (FSL) provides a promising approach to data
scarcity, yet current FSL research mainly relies on generic benchmark datasets
lacking remote-sensing disaster imagery, limiting its practical effectiveness.
Moreover, disaster images exhibit high intra-class variation and inter-class
similarity, hindering the performance of conventional metric-based FSL methods.
To address these issues, this paper introduces the Attention-based
Bhattacharyya-Hellinger Feature Aggregation Network (ATTBHFA-Net), which
linearly combines the Bhattacharyya coefficient and Hellinger distances to
compare and aggregate feature probability distributions for robust prototype
formation. The Bhattacharyya coefficient serves as a contrastive margin that
enhances inter-class separability, while the Hellinger distance regularizes
same-class alignment. This framework parallels contrastive learning but
operates over probability distributions rather than embedded feature points.
Furthermore, a Bhattacharyya-Hellinger distance-based contrastive loss is
proposed as a distributional counterpart to cosine similarity loss, used
jointly with categorical cross-entropy to significantly improve FSL
performance. Experiments on four FSL benchmarks and two disaster image datasets
demonstrate the superior effectiveness and generalization of ATTBHFA-Net
compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The comprehensive four-stage approach effectively addresses street view extrapolation challenges and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in realistic view synthesis for autonomous driving simulation.

Abstract: Realistic view extrapolation is critical for closed-loop simulation in
autonomous driving, yet it remains a significant challenge for current Novel
View Synthesis (NVS) methods, which often produce distorted and inconsistent
images beyond the original trajectory. This report presents our winning
solution which ctook first place in the RealADSim Workshop NVS track at ICCV
2025. To address the core challenges of street view extrapolation, we introduce
a comprehensive four-stage pipeline. First, we employ a data-driven
initialization strategy to generate a robust pseudo-LiDAR point cloud, avoiding
local minima. Second, we inject strong geometric priors by modeling the road
surface with a novel dimension-reduced SDF termed 2D-SDF. Third, we leverage a
generative prior to create pseudo ground truth for extrapolated viewpoints,
providing auxilary supervision. Finally, a data-driven adaptation network
removes time-specific artifacts. On the RealADSim-NVS benchmark, our method
achieves a final score of 0.441, ranking first among all participants.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A generative pre-training model for facial knowledge learning using large-scale web-built data, achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art models on facial downstream tasks and enabling various face editing applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited research on large-scale pre-training models for facial knowledge learning compared to natural image understanding, with current approaches relying on manually annotated datasets that are labor-intensive and have limited scalability.

Method: Leverages large-scale web-built data (texts and images with human faces) for pre-training using self-supervised tasks including masked image/language modeling (MILM) and image-text matching (ITM), with image-text matching loss used during generation for controllable image/text generation.

Result: Achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art pre-training models on various facial downstream tasks such as attribution classification and expression recognition.

Conclusion: The approach is applicable to a wide range of face editing tasks including face attribute editing, expression manipulation, mask removal, and photo inpainting, demonstrating the effectiveness of using web-built data for facial knowledge learning.

Abstract: Compared to the prosperity of pre-training models in natural image
understanding, the research on large-scale pre-training models for facial
knowledge learning is still limited. Current approaches mainly rely on manually
assembled and annotated face datasets for training, but labeling such datasets
is labor-intensive and the trained models have limited scalability beyond the
training data. To address these limitations, we present a generative
pre-training model for facial knowledge learning that leverages large-scale
web-built data for training. We use texts and images containing human faces
crawled from the internet and conduct pre-training on self-supervised tasks,
including masked image/language modeling (MILM) and image-text matching (ITM).
During the generation stage, we further utilize the image-text matching loss to
pull the generation distribution towards the control signal for controllable
image/text generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves
comparable performance to state-of-the-art pre-training models for various
facial downstream tasks, such as attribution classification and expression
recognition. Furthermore, our approach is also applicable to a wide range of
face editing tasks, including face attribute editing, expression manipulation,
mask removal, and photo inpainting.

*Jiayu Zhang,Qilang Ye,Shuo Ye,Xun Lin,Zihan Song,Zitong Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AV-Master is a novel framework for Audio-Visual Question Answering that dynamically models temporal and modality dimensions to extract key information from complex scenes with redundant content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AVQA methods lack flexibility in temporal sampling and modality preference awareness, limiting their ability to focus on question-relevant information in complex scenarios.

Method: Uses dynamic adaptive focus sampling for temporal dimension, preference-aware strategy for modality dimension, and dual-path contrastive loss for cross-modal consistency.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing methods on four large-scale benchmarks, especially in complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: AV-Master effectively addresses redundancy and fragmentation issues in AVQA through dynamic temporal and modality modeling.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) requires models to effectively utilize
both visual and auditory modalities to answer complex and diverse questions
about audio-visual scenes. However, existing methods lack sufficient
flexibility and dynamic adaptability in temporal sampling and modality
preference awareness, making it difficult to focus on key information based on
the question. This limits their reasoning capability in complex scenarios. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named AV-Master. It
enhances the model's ability to extract key information from complex
audio-visual scenes with substantial redundant content by dynamically modeling
both temporal and modality dimensions. In the temporal dimension, we introduce
a dynamic adaptive focus sampling mechanism that progressively focuses on
audio-visual segments most relevant to the question, effectively mitigating
redundancy and segment fragmentation in traditional sampling methods. In the
modality dimension, we propose a preference-aware strategy that models each
modality's contribution independently, enabling selective activation of
critical features. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-path contrastive loss to
reinforce consistency and complementarity across temporal and modality
dimensions, guiding the model to learn question-specific cross-modal
collaborative representations. Experiments on four large-scale benchmarks show
that AV-Master significantly outperforms existing methods, especially in
complex reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion-DRO is a new preference learning framework for text-to-image diffusion models that uses inverse reinforcement learning to cast preference learning as a ranking problem, eliminating reward model dependency and improving training stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DPO methods struggle with accurate image probability estimation due to sigmoid function non-linearity and limited diversity in offline datasets, motivating a more stable and effective approach.

Method: Diffusion-DRO frames preference learning as a ranking problem using inverse reinforcement learning, simplifies training to a denoising formulation, and combines offline expert demonstrations with online policy-generated negative samples.

Result: Experiments show Diffusion-DRO achieves improved generation quality across challenging prompts, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in both quantitative metrics and user studies.

Conclusion: Diffusion-DRO provides an effective solution for aligning diffusion models with human preferences by overcoming limitations of previous DPO methods through its ranking-based approach and hybrid data strategy.

Abstract: Direct preference optimization (DPO) methods have shown strong potential in
aligning text-to-image diffusion models with human preferences by training on
paired comparisons. These methods improve training stability by avoiding the
REINFORCE algorithm but still struggle with challenges such as accurately
estimating image probabilities due to the non-linear nature of the sigmoid
function and the limited diversity of offline datasets. In this paper, we
introduce Diffusion Denoising Ranking Optimization (Diffusion-DRO), a new
preference learning framework grounded in inverse reinforcement learning.
Diffusion-DRO removes the dependency on a reward model by casting preference
learning as a ranking problem, thereby simplifying the training objective into
a denoising formulation and overcoming the non-linear estimation issues found
in prior methods. Moreover, Diffusion-DRO uniquely integrates offline expert
demonstrations with online policy-generated negative samples, enabling it to
effectively capture human preferences while addressing the limitations of
offline data. Comprehensive experiments show that Diffusion-DRO delivers
improved generation quality across a range of challenging and unseen prompts,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in both both quantitative metrics and
user studies. Our source code and pre-trained models are available at

TL;DR: GroupHOI is a framework for Human-Object Interaction Detection that models interactions from a group perspective using geometric proximity and semantic similarity, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HOI-DET methods focus on pairwise relationships but overlook collective behaviors where multiple humans and objects engage in joint activities, which are common in real-world scenarios.

Method: Groups humans and objects using learnable proximity estimator based on spatial features, computes soft correspondence via self-attention within groups, and enhances transformer-based decoder with local contextual cues from HO-pair features.

Result: Achieves superior performance on HICO-DET and V-COCO benchmarks, and shows leading performance on the challenging Nonverbal Interaction Detection (NVI-DET) task involving higher-order interactions.

Conclusion: GroupHOI effectively addresses the limitation of pairwise relationship modeling by considering collective behaviors through geometric proximity and semantic similarity, demonstrating the importance of group-level interaction modeling in HOI detection.

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction Detection (HOI-DET) aims to localize human-object
pairs and identify their interactive relationships. To aggregate contextual
cues, existing methods typically propagate information across all detected
entities via self-attention mechanisms, or establish message passing between
humans and objects with bipartite graphs. However, they primarily focus on
pairwise relationships, overlooking that interactions in real-world scenarios
often emerge from collective behaviors (multiple humans and objects engaging in
joint activities). In light of this, we revisit relation modeling from a group
view and propose GroupHOI, a framework that propagates contextual information
in terms of geometric proximity and semantic similarity. To exploit the
geometric proximity, humans and objects are grouped into distinct clusters
using a learnable proximity estimator based on spatial features derived from
bounding boxes. In each group, a soft correspondence is computed via
self-attention to aggregate and dispatch contextual cues. To incorporate the
semantic similarity, we enhance the vanilla transformer-based interaction
decoder with local contextual cues from HO-pair features. Extensive experiments
on HICO-DET and V-COCO benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of GroupHOI over
the state-of-the-art methods. It also exhibits leading performance on the more
challenging Nonverbal Interaction Detection (NVI-DET) task, which involves
varied forms of higher-order interactions within groups.

### [52] [Visual Space Optimization for Zero-shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00330)
*Xinsheng Wang,Shanmin Pang,Jihua Zhu,Zhongyu Li,Zhiqiang Tian,Yaochen Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes two strategies to optimize the visual embedding space for zero-shot learning: visual prototype learning and intermediate embedding space optimization, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current zero-shot learning models use visual space as embedding space, but discrete distribution of visual features makes data structure unremarkable. Optimizing visual space allows semantic vectors to be embedded more effectively.

Method: Two strategies: 1) Visual prototype method - learns a prototype for each visual class to represent classes instead of discrete features; 2) Intermediate embedding space optimization using multilayer perceptron framework to make visual data structure more distinctive.

Result: Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show that optimizing visual space benefits zero-shot learning. The prototype-based method achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Optimizing the visual embedding space is crucial for effective zero-shot learning, and the proposed visual prototype method sets new state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Zero-shot learning, which aims to recognize new categories that are not
included in the training set, has gained popularity owing to its potential
ability in the real-word applications. Zero-shot learning models rely on
learning an embedding space, where both semantic descriptions of classes and
visual features of instances can be embedded for nearest neighbor search.
Recently, most of the existing works consider the visual space formulated by
deep visual features as an ideal choice of the embedding space. However, the
discrete distribution of instances in the visual space makes the data structure
unremarkable. We argue that optimizing the visual space is crucial as it allows
semantic vectors to be embedded into the visual space more effectively. In this
work, we propose two strategies to accomplish this purpose. One is the visual
prototype based method, which learns a visual prototype for each visual class,
so that, in the visual space, a class can be represented by a prototype feature
instead of a series of discrete visual features. The other is to optimize the
visual feature structure in an intermediate embedding space, and in this method
we successfully devise a multilayer perceptron framework based algorithm that
is able to learn the common intermediate embedding space and meanwhile to make
the visual data structure more distinctive. Through extensive experimental
evaluation on four benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that optimizing visual
space is beneficial for zero-shot learning. Besides, the proposed prototype
based method achieves the new state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FeatureFool is a zero-query black-box attack that exploits DNN-extracted features to alter video feature spaces, achieving high attack success without iterative queries while maintaining video quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing black-box attacks require multiple queries and are impractical for real-world applications, especially for Video-LLMs. No video-domain attacks directly leverage feature maps to shift clean-video feature spaces.

Method: Utilizes information extracted from DNNs to directly alter the feature space of clean videos, performing zero-query attacks by exploiting DNN-extracted features without iterative interaction.

Result: Achieves >70% attack success rate against traditional video classifiers without queries. Successfully bypasses Video-LLM recognition through feature map transferability, with high quality metrics (SSIM, PSNR, Temporal-Inconsistency).

Conclusion: FeatureFool demonstrates effective zero-query black-box attacks in video domain, showing practical viability for real-world scenarios while maintaining stealth through high-quality adversarial videos.

Abstract: The vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) has been preliminarily
verified. Existing black-box adversarial attacks usually require multi-round
interaction with the model and consume numerous queries, which is impractical
in the real-world and hard to scale to recently emerged Video-LLMs. Moreover,
no attack in the video domain directly leverages feature maps to shift the
clean-video feature space. We therefore propose FeatureFool, a stealthy,
video-domain, zero-query black-box attack that utilizes information extracted
from a DNN to alter the feature space of clean videos. Unlike query-based
methods that rely on iterative interaction, FeatureFool performs a zero-query
attack by directly exploiting DNN-extracted information. This efficient
approach is unprecedented in the video domain. Experiments show that
FeatureFool achieves an attack success rate above 70\% against traditional
video classifiers without any queries. Benefiting from the transferability of
the feature map, it can also craft harmful content and bypass Video-LLM
recognition. Additionally, adversarial videos generated by FeatureFool exhibit
high quality in terms of SSIM, PSNR, and Temporal-Inconsistency, making the
attack barely perceptible. This paper may contain violent or explicit content.

Motivation: Existing ICA methods use single visual modality features which are insufficient to capture perceived representations related to image complexity. Cross-modal scene semantic information has shown success in perceptual tasks but hasn't been explored for ICA.

Method: CM-SSA consists of two branches: complexity regression branch that estimates complexity levels, and scene semantic alignment branch that aligns images with text prompts through pair-wise learning to leverage rich scene semantic information.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple ICA datasets show CM-SSA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: Cross-modal scene semantic alignment effectively enhances ICA performance by making complexity predictions more consistent with human subjective perception.

Abstract: Image complexity assessment (ICA) is a challenging task in perceptual
evaluation due to the subjective nature of human perception and the inherent
semantic diversity in real-world images. Existing ICA methods predominantly
rely on hand-crafted or shallow convolutional neural network-based features of
a single visual modality, which are insufficient to fully capture the perceived
representations closely related to image complexity. Recently, cross-modal
scene semantic information has been shown to play a crucial role in various
computer vision tasks, particularly those involving perceptual understanding.
However, the exploration of cross-modal scene semantic information in the
context of ICA remains unaddressed. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a
novel ICA method called Cross-Modal Scene Semantic Alignment (CM-SSA), which
leverages scene semantic alignment from a cross-modal perspective to enhance
ICA performance, enabling complexity predictions to be more consistent with
subjective human perception. Specifically, the proposed CM-SSA consists of a
complexity regression branch and a scene semantic alignment branch. The
complexity regression branch estimates image complexity levels under the
guidance of the scene semantic alignment branch, while the scene semantic
alignment branch is used to align images with corresponding text prompts that
convey rich scene semantic information by pair-wise learning. Extensive
experiments on several ICA datasets demonstrate that the proposed CM-SSA
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Codes are available at

### [55] [S2AP: Score-space Sharpness Minimization for Adversarial Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18381)
*Giorgio Piras,Qi Zhao,Fabio Brau,Maura Pintor,Christian Wressnegger,Battista Biggio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: S2AP is a novel adversarial pruning method that uses score-space sharpness minimization to stabilize mask selection and improve robustness during neural network compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial pruning methods suffer from unstable mask selection due to sharp local minima in the robust loss landscape when optimizing importance scores, which reduces their robustness.

Method: Proposes Score-space Sharpness-aware Adversarial Pruning (S2AP) that minimizes sharpness in score space by perturbing importance scores and minimizing the corresponding robust loss during mask search.

Result: Extensive experiments show S2AP effectively minimizes score-space sharpness, stabilizes mask selection, and improves robustness across various datasets, models, and sparsity levels.

Conclusion: S2AP successfully addresses the instability in adversarial pruning methods through score-space sharpness minimization, leading to more robust compressed neural networks.

Abstract: Adversarial pruning methods have emerged as a powerful tool for compressing
neural networks while preserving robustness against adversarial attacks. These
methods typically follow a three-step pipeline: (i) pretrain a robust model,
(ii) select a binary mask for weight pruning, and (iii) finetune the pruned
model. To select the binary mask, these methods minimize a robust loss by
assigning an importance score to each weight, and then keep the weights with
the highest scores. However, this score-space optimization can lead to sharp
local minima in the robust loss landscape and, in turn, to an unstable mask
selection, reducing the robustness of adversarial pruning methods. To overcome
this issue, we propose a novel plug-in method for adversarial pruning, termed
Score-space Sharpness-aware Adversarial Pruning (S2AP). Through our method, we
introduce the concept of score-space sharpness minimization, which operates
during the mask search by perturbing importance scores and minimizing the
corresponding robust loss. Extensive experiments across various datasets,
models, and sparsity levels demonstrate that S2AP effectively minimizes
sharpness in score space, stabilizing the mask selection, and ultimately
improving the robustness of adversarial pruning methods.

TL;DR: A novel method using entropy of conformally-derived geometric features from cortical surfaces achieves 98.62% accuracy in distinguishing Alzheimer's patients from healthy controls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Alzheimer's disease causes significant cortical atrophy, making geometric surface analysis valuable for diagnosis. The study aims to develop an automated and accurate diagnostic tool using local surface representations.

Method: Used T1-weighted MRI from 160 participants (80 AD, 80 controls) from ADNI. Reconstructed cortical surfaces with Freesurfer, computed geometric attributes (area distortion, conformal factor via Ricci flow, Gaussian curvature), applied Shannon entropy to create feature vectors, and trained multiple classifiers.

Result: The method was highly effective in distinguishing AD patients. MLP and Logistic Regression classifiers achieved the best performance with 98.62% accuracy and F1 score, with statistical significance confirmed by Welch's t-test.

Conclusion: Entropy of conformally-derived geometric features provides a powerful metric for cortical morphometry. The high accuracy demonstrates potential for enhancing Alzheimer's disease study and diagnosis in clinical research.

Abstract: Background and Objective: In brain imaging, geometric surface models are
essential for analyzing the 3D shapes of anatomical structures. Alzheimer's
disease (AD) is associated with significant cortical atrophy, making such shape
analysis a valuable diagnostic tool. The objective of this study is to
introduce and validate a novel local surface representation method for the
automated and accurate diagnosis of AD. Methods: The study utilizes T1-weighted
MRI scans from 160 participants (80 AD patients and 80 healthy controls) from
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Cortical surface models
were reconstructed from the MRI data using Freesurfer. Key geometric attributes
were computed from the 3D meshes. Area distortion and conformal factor were
derived using Ricci flow for conformal parameterization, while Gaussian
curvature was calculated directly from the mesh geometry. Shannon entropy was
applied to these three features to create compact and informative feature
vectors. The feature vectors were used to train and evaluate a suite of
classifiers (e.g. XGBoost, MLP, Logistic Regression, etc.). Results:
Statistical significance of performance differences between classifiers was
evaluated using paired Welch's t-test. The method proved highly effective in
distinguishing AD patients from healthy controls. The Multi-Layer Perceptron
(MLP) and Logistic Regression classifiers outperformed all others, achieving an
accuracy and F$_1$ Score of 98.62%. Conclusions: This study confirms that the
entropy of conformally-derived geometric features provides a powerful and
robust metric for cortical morphometry. The high classification accuracy
underscores the method's potential to enhance the study and diagnosis of
Alzheimer's disease, offering a straightforward yet powerful tool for clinical
research applications.

TL;DR: Proposes Bayesian FCTN (BFCTN) method for hyperspectral-multispectral image fusion using probabilistic tensor decomposition with hierarchical sparse priors to preserve spatial-spectral structures and model cross-dimensional correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tensor decomposition methods disrupt spatial-spectral structures through data vectorization/reshaping, impose rigid constraints, require extensive manual parameter tuning, and lack robustness against noise and degradation.

Method: Bayesian FCTN framework with hierarchical sparse prior connecting factor tensors, modeling spatial-spectral correlations and local scene homogeneity. Uses Variational Bayesian inference and EM algorithm for parameter estimation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art fusion accuracy, strong robustness against noise and spatial degradation, and practical applicability in complex real-world scenarios with reduced manual parameter tuning.

Conclusion: BFCTN effectively addresses limitations of existing tensor decomposition methods by preserving intrinsic structures, modeling cross-dimensional correlations, and providing automated parameter estimation with improved robustness.

Abstract: Tensor decomposition is a powerful tool for data analysis and has been
extensively employed in the field of hyperspectral-multispectral image fusion
(HMF). Existing tensor decomposition-based fusion methods typically rely on
disruptive data vectorization/reshaping or impose rigid constraints on the
arrangement of factor tensors, hindering the preservation of spatial-spectral
structures and the modeling of cross-dimensional correlations. Although recent
advances utilizing the Fully-Connected Tensor Network (FCTN) decomposition have
partially alleviated these limitations, the process of reorganizing data into
higher-order tensors still disrupts the intrinsic spatial-spectral structure.
Furthermore, these methods necessitate extensive manual parameter tuning and
exhibit limited robustness against noise and spatial degradation. To alleviate
these issues, we propose the Bayesian FCTN (BFCTN) method. Within this
probabilistic framework, a hierarchical sparse prior that characterizing the
sparsity of physical elements, establishes connections between the factor
tensors. This framework explicitly models the intrinsic physical coupling among
spatial structures, spectral signatures, and local scene homogeneity. For model
learning, we develop a parameter estimation method based on Variational
Bayesian inference (VB) and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, which
significantly reduces the need for manual parameter tuning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BFCTN not only achieves state-of-the-art fusion
accuracy and strong robustness but also exhibits practical applicability in
complex real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScaleNet enables efficient scaling of vision transformers by inserting additional layers with weight sharing and adapter modules, achieving better performance with fewer training epochs compared to training from scratch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational intensity and high cost of training larger vision transformer models from scratch, while maintaining superior performance.

Method: ScaleNet inserts additional layers into pretrained ViTs using layer-wise weight sharing and parallel adapter modules with adjustment parameters to maintain parameter efficiency and optimize performance.

Result: On ImageNet-1K, a 2× depth-scaled DeiT-Base model achieved 7.42% accuracy improvement over training from scratch while requiring only one-third of the training epochs. Also validated in object detection tasks.

Conclusion: ScaleNet provides a cost-effective solution for scaling vision transformers efficiently, with demonstrated success in both image classification and downstream vision tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated that
larger models often achieve superior performance. However, training these
models remains computationally intensive and costly. To address this challenge,
we introduce ScaleNet, an efficient approach for scaling ViT models. Unlike
conventional training from scratch, ScaleNet facilitates rapid model expansion
with negligible increases in parameters, building on existing pretrained
models. This offers a cost-effective solution for scaling up ViTs.
Specifically, ScaleNet achieves model expansion by inserting additional layers
into pretrained ViTs, utilizing layer-wise weight sharing to maintain
parameters efficiency. Each added layer shares its parameter tensor with a
corresponding layer from the pretrained model. To mitigate potential
performance degradation due to shared weights, ScaleNet introduces a small set
of adjustment parameters for each layer. These adjustment parameters are
implemented through parallel adapter modules, ensuring that each instance of
the shared parameter tensor remains distinct and optimized for its specific
function. Experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset demonstrate that ScaleNet
enables efficient expansion of ViT models. With a 2$\times$ depth-scaled
DeiT-Base model, ScaleNet achieves a 7.42% accuracy improvement over training
from scratch while requiring only one-third of the training epochs,
highlighting its efficiency in scaling ViTs. Beyond image classification, our
method shows significant potential for application in downstream vision areas,
as evidenced by the validation in object detection task.

Motivation: The key challenge hindering the development of generative models that understand individual preferences is the lack of in-the-wild and fine-grained user preference annotations.

Method: The dataset enables training better preference alignment models, investigating retrieval models and vision-language models on personalized tasks, and proposing an end-to-end framework for editing customized diffusion models in latent weight space.

Result: The dataset successfully enabled training better preference alignment models and demonstrated effectiveness in personalized image retrieval and generative model recommendation tasks.

Conclusion: ImageGem dataset enables, for the first time, a new paradigm for generative model personalization by providing real-world fine-grained user preference data.

Abstract: We introduce ImageGem, a dataset for studying generative models that
understand fine-grained individual preferences. We posit that a key challenge
hindering the development of such a generative model is the lack of in-the-wild

interaction data from 57K users, who collectively have built 242K customized
LoRAs, written 3M text prompts, and created 5M generated images. With user
preference annotations from our dataset, we were able to train better
preference alignment models. In addition, leveraging individual user
preference, we investigated the performance of retrieval models and a
vision-language model on personalized image retrieval and generative model
recommendation. Finally, we propose an end-to-end framework for editing
customized diffusion models in a latent weight space to align with individual
user preferences. Our results demonstrate that the ImageGem dataset enables,

### [61] [Beyond Single Images: Retrieval Self-Augmented Unsupervised Camouflaged Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18437)
*Ji Du,Xin Wang,Fangwei Hao,Mingyang Yu,Chunyuan Chen,Jiesheng Wu,Bin Wang,Jing Xu,Ping Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RISE is a retrieval-based self-augmented paradigm for camouflaged object detection that generates pseudo-labels using dataset-level contextual information without ground truth annotations, outperforming state-of-the-art unsupervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous COD methods primarily use image-level modeling or annotation-based optimization, failing to leverage valuable dataset-level contextual information and requiring laborious annotations. RISE aims to address these limitations by exploiting the entire training dataset without ground truth.

Method: RISE constructs prototype libraries for environments and camouflaged objects using training images without ground truth. It employs a Clustering-then-Retrieval strategy to generate coarse masks through clustering, followed by histogram-based filtering and cross-category retrieval. Multi-View KNN Retrieval integrates retrieval results from diverse views to produce robust pseudo-masks.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that RISE outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and prompt-based methods in camouflaged object detection.

Conclusion: RISE provides an effective self-augmented paradigm for COD that leverages dataset-level contextual information without requiring manual annotations, achieving superior performance compared to existing unsupervised approaches.

Abstract: At the core of Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) lies segmenting objects
from their highly similar surroundings. Previous efforts navigate this
challenge primarily through image-level modeling or annotation-based
optimization. Despite advancing considerably, this commonplace practice hardly
taps valuable dataset-level contextual information or relies on laborious
annotations. In this paper, we propose RISE, a RetrIeval SElf-augmented
paradigm that exploits the entire training dataset to generate pseudo-labels
for single images, which could be used to train COD models. RISE begins by
constructing prototype libraries for environments and camouflaged objects using
training images (without ground truth), followed by K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
retrieval to generate pseudo-masks for each image based on these libraries. It
is important to recognize that using only training images without annotations
exerts a pronounced challenge in crafting high-quality prototype libraries. In
this light, we introduce a Clustering-then-Retrieval (CR) strategy, where
coarse masks are first generated through clustering, facilitating subsequent
histogram-based image filtering and cross-category retrieval to produce
high-confidence prototypes. In the KNN retrieval stage, to alleviate the effect
of artifacts in feature maps, we propose Multi-View KNN Retrieval (MVKR), which
integrates retrieval results from diverse views to produce more robust and
precise pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RISE outperforms
state-of-the-art unsupervised and prompt-based methods. Code is available at

TL;DR: A new latent diffusion model generates high-quality 3D chest CT scans from anatomical masks, enabling precise control over lung and nodule features with reduced computational requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a computationally efficient method for generating realistic 3D chest CT scans that can be precisely controlled through anatomical masks, addressing the need for diverse training data for AI models and healthcare education.

Method: Uses a latent diffusion model conditioned on 3D anatomical masks (lung and nodule regions) to synthesize 256x256x256 volumetric CT images at 1 mm resolution, requiring only a single mid-range GPU.

Result: The model successfully generates diverse CT volumes with and without lung nodules, but experiments show that conditioning solely on nodule masks produces anatomically incorrect outputs, demonstrating the necessity of incorporating global lung structure.

Conclusion: The proposed latent diffusion model provides an efficient and controllable approach for generating realistic 3D chest CT scans, serving as a valuable tool for AI training and healthcare applications while highlighting the importance of global anatomical context for accurate synthesis.

Abstract: This work introduces a new latent diffusion model to generate high-quality 3D
chest CT scans conditioned on 3D anatomical masks. The method synthesizes
volumetric images of size 256x256x256 at 1 mm isotropic resolution using a
single mid-range GPU, significantly lowering the computational cost compared to
existing approaches. The conditioning masks delineate lung and nodule regions,
enabling precise control over the output anatomical features. Experimental
results demonstrate that conditioning solely on nodule masks leads to
anatomically incorrect outputs, highlighting the importance of incorporating
global lung structure for accurate conditional synthesis. The proposed approach
supports the generation of diverse CT volumes with and without lung nodules of
varying attributes, providing a valuable tool for training AI models or
healthcare professionals.

TL;DR: Proposes VFM-VAE, a direct integration approach for Vision Foundation Models in Latent Diffusion Models that bypasses distillation, achieving superior performance and 10x faster convergence through novel decoder design and joint training strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current distillation-based approaches for incorporating Vision Foundation Models into LDMs weaken alignment robustness and cause semantic deviation under distribution shifts, motivating a more direct integration method.

Method: Develops VFM-VAE with Multi-Scale Latent Fusion and Progressive Resolution Reconstruction blocks in the decoder, plus SE-CKNNA metric for representation analysis and joint tokenizer-diffusion alignment strategy.

Result: Achieves gFID (w/o CFG) of 2.20 in 80 epochs (10x speedup) and 1.62 after 640 epochs, establishing direct VFM integration as superior paradigm.

Conclusion: Direct VFM integration through VFM-VAE with proper decoder design and joint training strategy outperforms distillation-based approaches in both performance and efficiency for LDMs.

Abstract: The performance of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) is critically dependent on
the quality of their visual tokenizer. While recent works have explored
incorporating Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) via distillation, we identify a
fundamental flaw in this approach: it inevitably weakens the robustness of
alignment with the original VFM, causing the aligned latents to deviate
semantically under distribution shifts. In this paper, we bypass distillation
by proposing a more direct approach: Vision Foundation Model Variational
Autoencoder (VFM-VAE). To resolve the inherent tension between the VFM's
semantic focus and the need for pixel-level fidelity, we redesign the VFM-VAE
decoder with Multi-Scale Latent Fusion and Progressive Resolution
Reconstruction blocks, enabling high-quality reconstruction from spatially
coarse VFM features. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of
representation dynamics during diffusion training, introducing the proposed
SE-CKNNA metric as a more precise tool for this diagnosis. This analysis allows
us to develop a joint tokenizer-diffusion alignment strategy that dramatically
accelerates convergence. Our innovations in tokenizer design and training
strategy lead to superior performance and efficiency: our system reaches a gFID
(w/o CFG) of 2.20 in merely 80 epochs (a 10x speedup over prior tokenizers).
With continued training to 640 epochs, it further attains a gFID (w/o CFG) of
1.62, establishing direct VFM integration as a superior paradigm for LDMs.

Motivation: To address the challenging problem of reconstructing 4D high dynamic range scenes from unposed monocular low dynamic range videos with alternating exposures, which hasn't been studied before.

Method: A unified framework with two-stage optimization: first stage learns HDR Gaussian representation in orthographic camera space without poses, second stage transforms to world space and refines with camera poses, plus temporal luminance regularization for HDR appearance consistency.

Result: Significantly outperforms alternative solutions adapted from state-of-the-art methods in both rendering quality and speed, as demonstrated through extensive experiments on a new evaluation benchmark.

Conclusion: Mono4DGS-HDR successfully enables 4D HDR scene reconstruction from challenging unposed monocular LDR video inputs with alternating exposures, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: We introduce Mono4DGS-HDR, the first system for reconstructing renderable 4D
high dynamic range (HDR) scenes from unposed monocular low dynamic range (LDR)
videos captured with alternating exposures. To tackle such a challenging
problem, we present a unified framework with two-stage optimization approach
based on Gaussian Splatting. The first stage learns a video HDR Gaussian
representation in orthographic camera coordinate space, eliminating the need
for camera poses and enabling robust initial HDR video reconstruction. The
second stage transforms video Gaussians into world space and jointly refines
the world Gaussians with camera poses. Furthermore, we propose a temporal
luminance regularization strategy to enhance the temporal consistency of the
HDR appearance. Since our task has not been studied before, we construct a new

significantly outperforms alternative solutions adapted from state-of-the-art

Conclusion: RAG-enhanced LM reasoning enables scalable VMMR without large-scale retraining, supporting rapid updates by adding textual descriptions of new vehicles for smart-city applications.

Abstract: Vehicle make and model recognition (VMMR) is an important task in intelligent
transportation systems, but existing approaches struggle to adapt to newly
released models. Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) provides strong
visual-text alignment, yet its fixed pretrained weights limit performance
without costly image-specific finetuning. We propose a pipeline that integrates
vision language models (VLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to
support zero-shot recognition through text-based reasoning. A VLM converts
vehicle images into descriptive attributes, which are compared against a
database of textual features. Relevant entries are retrieved and combined with
the description to form a prompt, and a language model (LM) infers the make and
model. This design avoids large-scale retraining and enables rapid updates by
adding textual descriptions of new vehicles. Experiments show that the proposed
method improves recognition by nearly 20% over the CLIP baseline, demonstrating
the potential of RAG-enhanced LM reasoning for scalable VMMR in smart-city

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the growing waste problem from convenience packaging by enabling efficient waste sorting through AI on resource-constrained devices.

Method: Benchmarked image classification models (EfficientNetV2S/M, ResNet50/101, MobileNet) and object detection models (YOLOv8n, YOLOv11n) using custom waste dataset annotated with Annotated Lab tool, with model quantization for efficiency.

Result: EfficientNetV2S achieved highest accuracy (96%) but high latency (0.22s) and emissions. Lightweight detection models achieved 77% mAP with ultra-fast inference (0.03s) and small model sizes (<7MB). Quantization reduced model size and VRAM by up to 75%.

Conclusion: Lightweight object detection models with quantization are ideal for real-time, low-power waste sorting on edge devices, demonstrating successful implementation of "Greener AI" for sustainable waste management.

Abstract: The rise of convenience packaging has led to generation of enormous waste,
making efficient waste sorting crucial for sustainable waste management. To
address this, we developed DWaste, a computer vision-powered platform designed
for real-time waste sorting on resource-constrained smartphones and edge
devices, including offline functionality. We benchmarked various image
classification models (EfficientNetV2S/M, ResNet50/101, MobileNet) and object
detection (YOLOv8n, YOLOv11n) using a subset of our own waste data set and
annotated it using the custom tool Annotated Lab. We found a clear trade-off
between accuracy and resource consumption: the best classifier,
EfficientNetV2S, achieved high accuracy (~ 96%) but suffered from high latency
(~ 0.22s) and elevated carbon emissions. In contrast, lightweight object
detection models delivered strong performance (up to 77% mAP) with ultra-fast
inference (~ 0.03s) and significantly smaller model sizes (< 7MB), making them
ideal for real-time, low-power use. Model quantization further maximized
efficiency, substantially reducing model size and VRAM usage by up to 75%. Our
work demonstrates the successful implementation of "Greener AI" models to

TL;DR: A diffusion transformer-based method for template-based object pose estimation that reformulates the problem as ray alignment between query images and posed templates, achieving competitive performance on unseen object pose estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional template-based pose estimation methods fail when incorrect templates are retrieved, leading to inaccurate pose predictions. The paper aims to address this limitation by learning to align viewing directions from multiple posed templates with non-posed query images.

Method: Reformulates pose estimation as a ray alignment problem using a diffusion transformer architecture. Reparameterizes object rotation using object-centered camera rays and models translation via dense translation offsets. Uses geometric priors from templates and a coarse-to-fine training strategy with narrowed template sampling.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets show competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches in unseen object pose estimation.

Conclusion: The proposed ray alignment formulation and diffusion transformer architecture effectively address template retrieval failures in pose estimation, demonstrating strong performance on challenging unseen object pose estimation tasks.

Abstract: Typical template-based object pose pipelines estimate the pose by retrieving
the closest matching template and aligning it with the observed image. However,
failure to retrieve the correct template often leads to inaccurate pose
predictions. To address this, we reformulate template-based object pose
estimation as a ray alignment problem, where the viewing directions from
multiple posed template images are learned to align with a non-posed query
image. Inspired by recent progress in diffusion-based camera pose estimation,
we embed this formulation into a diffusion transformer architecture that aligns
a query image with a set of posed templates. We reparameterize object rotation
using object-centered camera rays and model object translation by extending
scale-invariant translation estimation to dense translation offsets. Our model
leverages geometric priors from the templates to guide accurate query pose
inference. A coarse-to-fine training strategy based on narrowed template
sampling improves performance without modifying the network architecture.
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets show competitive
results of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches in unseen object
pose estimation.

*Dušan Malić,Christian Fruhwirth-Reisinger,Alexander Prutsch,Wei Lin,Samuel Schulter,Horst Possegger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents GBlobs, a local point cloud feature descriptor that addresses the geometric shortcut problem in LiDAR-based 3D object detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance in RoboSense 2025 Track 3 by improving generalization across diverse sensor placements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LiDAR-based 3D detectors suffer from a geometric shortcut where models rely on absolute object positions rather than shape characteristics, limiting generalization when encountering different point distributions from varying sensor placements.

Method: The solution uses GBlobs as local point cloud feature descriptors instead of conventional global features (absolute Cartesian coordinates), which circumvents the geometric shortcut and forces the network to learn robust, object-centric representations.

Result: The approach achieved state-of-the-art performance on 3D object detection under various sensor placements in RoboSense 2025 Track 3, demonstrating significantly enhanced generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: Using GBlobs as network input features effectively addresses the geometric shortcut problem in LiDAR-based 3D detection, enabling better generalization across diverse sensor configurations and improving overall detection performance.

Abstract: This technical report outlines the top-ranking solution for RoboSense 2025:
Track 3, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 3D object detection under
various sensor placements. Our submission utilizes GBlobs, a local point cloud
feature descriptor specifically designed to enhance model generalization across
diverse LiDAR configurations. Current LiDAR-based 3D detectors often suffer
from a \enquote{geometric shortcut} when trained on conventional global
features (\ie, absolute Cartesian coordinates). This introduces a position bias
that causes models to primarily rely on absolute object position rather than
distinguishing shape and appearance characteristics. Although effective for
in-domain data, this shortcut severely limits generalization when encountering
different point distributions, such as those resulting from varying sensor
placements. By using GBlobs as network input features, we effectively
circumvent this geometric shortcut, compelling the network to learn robust,
object-centric representations. This approach significantly enhances the
model's ability to generalize, resulting in the exceptional performance
demonstrated in this challenge.

*Sanjay Kumar,Tim Brophy,Reenu Mohandas,Eoin Martino Grua,Ganesh Sistu,Valentina Donzella,Ciaran Eising*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The Occluded nuScenes Dataset extends the nuScenes benchmark with controlled, parameterized sensor occlusions for cameras, radar, and LiDAR to enable systematic evaluation of perception models under adverse conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autonomous driving datasets lack controlled, parameterized degradations across multiple sensing modalities, limiting systematic evaluation of perception and fusion architectures under well-defined adverse conditions like sensor failures and environmental occlusions.

Method: Extended nuScenes dataset with: camera occlusions (4 types, including 2 new designs), radar degradations (3 types), and LiDAR degradations (3 types) using parameterized scripts for flexible and repeatable generation of occluded data.

Result: Created the first multi-sensor occlusion dataset with controlled and reproducible degradations, enabling consistent evaluation of perception models under partial sensor failures and environmental interference.

Conclusion: This dataset advances research on robust sensor fusion, resilience analysis, and safety-critical perception in automated driving by providing systematic testing capabilities for adverse conditions.

Abstract: Robust perception in automated driving requires reliable performance under
adverse conditions, where sensors may be affected by partial failures or
environmental occlusions. Although existing autonomous driving datasets
inherently contain sensor noise and environmental variability, very few enable
controlled, parameterised, and reproducible degradations across multiple
sensing modalities. This gap limits the ability to systematically evaluate how
perception and fusion architectures perform under well-defined adverse
conditions. To address this limitation, we introduce the Occluded nuScenes
Dataset, a novel extension of the widely used nuScenes benchmark. For the
camera modality, we release both the full and mini versions with four types of
occlusions, two adapted from public implementations and two newly designed. For
radar and LiDAR, we provide parameterised occlusion scripts that implement
three types of degradations each, enabling flexible and repeatable generation
of occluded data. This resource supports consistent, reproducible evaluation of
perception models under partial sensor failures and environmental interference.
By releasing the first multi-sensor occlusion dataset with controlled and
reproducible degradations, we aim to advance research on robust sensor fusion,
resilience analysis, and safety-critical perception in automated driving.

*Zhenxing Zhang,Jiayan Teng,Zhuoyi Yang,Tiankun Cao,Cheng Wang,Xiaotao Gu,Jie Tang,Dan Guo,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Kaleido is a subject-to-video (S2V) generation framework that synthesizes subject-consistent videos from multiple reference images, addressing limitations in multi-subject consistency and background disentanglement through improved data construction and a novel Reference Rotary Positional Encoding method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing S2V generation models struggle with maintaining multi-subject consistency and handling background disentanglement, leading to lower reference fidelity and semantic drift when using multiple reference images. These issues stem from limited training data diversity and suboptimal multi-image integration mechanisms.

Method: Proposes a dedicated data construction pipeline with low-quality sample filtering and diverse data synthesis to create consistency-preserving training data. Introduces Reference Rotary Positional Encoding (R-RoPE) to enable stable and precise integration of multiple reference images.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Kaleido significantly outperforms previous methods in consistency, fidelity, and generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: Kaleido represents an advance in S2V generation by effectively addressing key limitations in multi-subject consistency and background handling through improved data construction and novel positional encoding techniques.

Abstract: We present Kaleido, a subject-to-video~(S2V) generation framework, which aims
to synthesize subject-consistent videos conditioned on multiple reference
images of target subjects. Despite recent progress in S2V generation models,
existing approaches remain inadequate at maintaining multi-subject consistency
and at handling background disentanglement, often resulting in lower reference
fidelity and semantic drift under multi-image conditioning. These shortcomings
can be attributed to several factors. Primarily, the training dataset suffers
from a lack of diversity and high-quality samples, as well as cross-paired
data, i.e., paired samples whose components originate from different instances.
In addition, the current mechanism for integrating multiple reference images is
suboptimal, potentially resulting in the confusion of multiple subjects. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a dedicated data construction pipeline,
incorporating low-quality sample filtering and diverse data synthesis, to
produce consistency-preserving training data. Moreover, we introduce Reference
Rotary Positional Encoding (R-RoPE) to process reference images, enabling
stable and precise multi-image integration. Extensive experiments across
numerous benchmarks demonstrate that Kaleido significantly outperforms previous
methods in consistency, fidelity, and generalization, marking an advance in S2V
generation.

*Yongmin Lee,Hye Won Chung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CovMatch is a scalable multimodal dataset distillation framework that aligns cross-covariance of real and synthetic features while regularizing feature distributions, enabling joint optimization of both image and text encoders for improved cross-modal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending dataset distillation to multimodal contrastive learning faces challenges in learning cross-modal alignment and managing computational costs. Prior approaches that freeze text encoders severely limit semantic alignment and become performance bottlenecks.

Method: Proposes CovMatch framework that aligns cross-covariance between real and synthetic features while regularizing feature distributions within each modality. Unlike prior methods, it enables joint optimization of both image and text encoders.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal distillation methods on Flickr30K and COCO datasets, achieving up to 6.8% absolute gains in retrieval accuracy using only 500 synthetic image-text pairs.

Conclusion: CovMatch provides a scalable solution for multimodal dataset distillation that enables joint encoder optimization, leading to stronger cross-modal alignment and significantly improved performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Multimodal dataset distillation aims to synthesize a small set of image-text
pairs that enables efficient training of large-scale vision-language models.
While dataset distillation has shown promise in unimodal tasks, extending it to
multimodal contrastive learning presents key challenges: learning cross-modal
alignment and managing the high computational cost of large encoders. Prior
approaches address scalability by freezing the text encoder and update only the
image encoder and text projection layer. However, we find this severely limits
semantic alignment and becomes a bottleneck for performance scaling. We propose
CovMatch, a scalable dataset distillation framework that aligns the
cross-covariance of real and synthetic features while regularizing feature
distributions within each modality. Unlike prior approaches, CovMatch enables
joint optimization of both encoders, leading to stronger cross-modal alignment
and improved performance. Evaluated on Flickr30K and COCO, CovMatch outperforms
state-of-the-art multimodal distillation methods and achieves up to 6.8%
absolute gains in retrieval accuracy using only 500 synthetic pairs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DThinker is a framework that enables 3D mental reasoning without 3D inputs, using two-stage training to align 3D latent representations and optimize reasoning trajectories based on outcome signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models struggle with 3D spatial understanding from limited views, as existing methods rely on text or 2D visual cues with limited representational capacity for 3D spatial imagination tasks.

Method: Two-stage training: first supervised training to align 3D latent representations from VLM with 3D foundation models (e.g., VGGT), then optimization of reasoning trajectory based solely on outcome signals to refine 3D mentaling.

Result: Extensive experiments show 3DThinker consistently outperforms strong baselines across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating effective 3D spatial reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: 3DThinker offers a new perspective for unifying 3D representations into multimodal reasoning and enables 3D mentaling during reasoning without requiring 3D prior input or explicitly labeled 3D training data.

Abstract: Though recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved
remarkable progress across a wide range of multimodal tasks, understanding 3D
spatial relationships from limited views remains a significant challenge.
Previous reasoning methods typically rely on pure text (e.g., topological
cognitive maps) or on 2D visual cues. However, their limited representational
capacity hinders performance in specific tasks that require 3D spatial
imagination. To address this limitation, we propose 3DThinker, a framework that
can effectively exploits the rich geometric information embedded within images
while reasoning, like humans do. Our framework is the first to enable 3D
mentaling during reasoning without any 3D prior input, and it does not rely on
explicitly labeled 3D data for training. Specifically, our training consists of
two stages. First, we perform supervised training to align the 3D latent
generated by VLM while reasoning with that of a 3D foundation model (e.g.,
VGGT). Then, we optimize the entire reasoning trajectory solely based on
outcome signals, thereby refining the underlying 3D mentaling. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks show that 3DThinker consistently
outperforms strong baselines and offers a new perspective toward unifying 3D
representations into multimodal reasoning. Our code will be available at

*Baptiste Bauvin,Loïc Baret,Ola Ahmad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel one-shot pruning framework using explainable deep learning and causal-aware pruning to efficiently reduce neural network size with minimal performance impact, without requiring fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome computational expense of iterative pruning methods and performance drops in existing one-shot pruning approaches by leveraging causal relationships between model predictions and structures.

Method: Causal-aware pruning approach that uses cause-effect relations between model predictions and structures in a progressive pruning process, applied directly at post-training without fine-tuning.

Result: Substantial model size reductions with minimal performance impact, outperforming counterparts and offering the best trade-off between compression and accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed one-shot pruning framework effectively reduces model size while maintaining performance, providing a practical solution for neural network compression without the need for retraining.

Abstract: Neural network compression has gained increasing attention in recent years,
particularly in computer vision applications, where the need for model
reduction is crucial for overcoming deployment constraints. Pruning is a widely
used technique that prompts sparsity in model structures, e.g. weights,
neurons, and layers, reducing size and inference costs. Structured pruning is
especially important as it allows for the removal of entire structures, which
further accelerates inference time and reduces memory overhead. However, it can
be computationally expensive, requiring iterative retraining and optimization.
To overcome this problem, recent methods considered one-shot setting, which
applies pruning directly at post-training. Unfortunately, they often lead to a
considerable drop in performance. In this paper, we focus on this issue by
proposing a novel one-shot pruning framework that relies on explainable deep
learning. First, we introduce a causal-aware pruning approach that leverages
cause-effect relations between model predictions and structures in a
progressive pruning process. It allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the
network, ensuring that the removed structures do not deter the performance of
the model. Then, through experiments conducted on convolution neural network
and vision transformer baselines, pre-trained on classification tasks, we
demonstrate that our method consistently achieves substantial reductions in
model size, with minimal impact on performance, and without the need for
fine-tuning. Overall, our approach outperforms its counterparts, offering the
best trade-off. Our code is available on GitHub.

*Sheida Rahnamai Kordasiabi,Damian Dalle Nogare,Florian Jug*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ε-Seg is a hierarchical variational autoencoder method for semantic segmentation of electron microscopy images that achieves competitive performance with sparse supervision (0.05% labeled data) using center-region masking, contrastive learning, and clustering-free label prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic segmentation of EM images is challenging due to biological complexity that can overwhelm human observers, and existing methods require extensive labeled data which is scarce in life sciences.

Method: Uses hierarchical VAEs with center-region masking for robust embeddings, sparse label contrastive learning and GMM prior for latent space structuring, and MLP segmentation head for direct label prediction instead of clustering.

Result: Achieves competitive sparsely-supervised segmentation results on 2 dense EM datasets and fluorescence microscopy data, working effectively with only 0.05% labeled training data.

Conclusion: ε-Seg provides an effective solution for semantic segmentation of complex biological images with minimal supervision, addressing the label scarcity problem in life sciences.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of electron microscopy (EM) images of biological
samples remains a challenge in the life sciences. EM data captures details of
biological structures, sometimes with such complexity that even human observers
can find it overwhelming. We introduce {\epsilon}-Seg, a method based on
hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs), employing center-region masking,
sparse label contrastive learning (CL), a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) prior,
and clustering-free label prediction. Center-region masking and the inpainting
loss encourage the model to learn robust and representative embeddings to
distinguish the desired classes, even if training labels are sparse (0.05% of
the total image data or less). For optimal performance, we employ CL and a GMM
prior to shape the latent space of the HVAE such that encoded input patches
tend to cluster wrt. the semantic classes we wish to distinguish. Finally,
instead of clustering latent embeddings for semantic segmentation, we propose a
MLP semantic segmentation head to directly predict class labels from latent
embeddings. We show empirical results of {\epsilon}-Seg and baseline methods on
2 dense EM datasets of biological tissues and demonstrate the applicability of
our method also on fluorescence microscopy data. Our results show that
{\epsilon}-Seg is capable of achieving competitive sparsely-supervised
segmentation results on complex biological image data, even if only limited
amounts of training labels are available.

*Kyo Kuroki,Yasuyuki Okoshi,Thiem Van Chu,Kazushi Kawamura,Masato Motomura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Binary Quadratic Quantization (BQQ), a novel matrix quantization method that uses binary quadratic expressions for superior compression and neural network quantization performance compared to conventional linear methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of conventional first-order quantization methods (uniform quantization, binary coding) that use linear combinations of binary bases, by leveraging the expressive power of binary quadratic expressions while maintaining compact data format.

Method: Binary Quadratic Quantization (BQQ) - uses binary quadratic expressions instead of linear combinations for matrix approximation, validated through matrix compression benchmarks and post-training quantization on Vision Transformer models.

Result: BQQ achieves superior trade-off between memory efficiency and reconstruction error for matrix compression, and strong PTQ performance - outperforms state-of-the-art PTQ by up to 2.2% and 59.1% on ImageNet under calibration-based and data-free scenarios with 2-bit quantization.

Conclusion: Binary quadratic expressions are surprisingly effective for efficient matrix approximation and neural network compression, demonstrating the power of higher-order binary representations.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel matrix quantization method, Binary Quadratic
Quantization (BQQ). In contrast to conventional first-order quantization
approaches, such as uniform quantization and binary coding quantization, that
approximate real-valued matrices via linear combinations of binary bases, BQQ
leverages the expressive power of binary quadratic expressions while
maintaining an extremely compact data format. We validate our approach with two
experiments: a matrix compression benchmark and post-training quantization
(PTQ) on pretrained Vision Transformer-based models. Experimental results
demonstrate that BQQ consistently achieves a superior trade-off between memory
efficiency and reconstruction error than conventional methods for compressing
diverse matrix data. It also delivers strong PTQ performance, even though we
neither target state-of-the-art PTQ accuracy under tight memory constraints nor
rely on PTQ-specific binary matrix optimization. For example, our proposed
method outperforms the state-of-the-art PTQ method by up to 2.2\% and 59.1% on
the ImageNet dataset under the calibration-based and data-free scenarios,
respectively, with quantization equivalent to 2 bits. These findings highlight
the surprising effectiveness of binary quadratic expressions for efficient
matrix approximation and neural network compression.

*Hichem Sahbi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel interactive satellite image change detection algorithm using active learning with an invertible network for data augmentation, achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve satellite image change detection by interactively querying users for labels and dynamically updating the model, addressing the challenge of limited labeled data.

Method: Uses an iterative active learning process with a question-and-answer model that queries users about image labels. Features a novel invertible network that maps images to latent spaces for linear augmentation, then back to input space for retraining.

Result: Experimental results show superior performance compared to related work.

Conclusion: The proposed framework with invertible network augmentation effectively improves change detection in satellite imagery through interactive active learning.

Abstract: This paper devises a novel interactive satellite image change detection
algorithm based on active learning. Our framework employs an iterative process
that leverages a question-and-answer model. This model queries the oracle
(user) about the labels of a small subset of images (dubbed as display), and
based on the oracle's responses, change detection model is dynamically updated.
The main contribution of our framework resides in a novel invertible network
that allows augmenting displays, by mapping them from highly nonlinear input
spaces to latent ones, where augmentation transformations become linear and
more tractable. The resulting augmented data are afterwards mapped back to the
input space, and used to retrain more effective change detection criteria in
the subsequent iterations of active learning. Experimental results demonstrate
superior performance of our proposed method compared to the related work.

*Hanif Rasyidi,Moshiur Farazi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes factors affecting end-to-end deep learning for historical writer identification, finding most models struggle with generalization in realistic document-level settings, but identifies one setup that achieves competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical writer identification remains challenging due to handwriting diversity, document degradation, and limited labeled samples. Traditional methods work well on curated datasets but end-to-end approaches struggle with generalization, especially in zero-shot scenarios.

Method: The study explores combinations of pre-processing methods, backbone architectures, and post-processing strategies including text segmentation, patch sampling, and feature aggregation to build end-to-end pipelines.

Result: Most configurations performed poorly due to weak capture of low-level visual features, inconsistent patch representations, and high sensitivity to content noise. However, one end-to-end setup achieved results comparable to top-performing systems.

Conclusion: The findings highlight key challenges in building robust end-to-end systems and provide insights into design choices that improve performance in historical document writer identification.

Abstract: This paper investigates various factors that influence the performance of
end-to-end deep learning approaches for historical writer identification (HWI),
a task that remains challenging due to the diversity of handwriting styles,
document degradation, and the limited number of labelled samples per writer.
These conditions often make accurate recognition difficult, even for human
experts. Traditional HWI methods typically rely on handcrafted image processing
and clustering techniques, which tend to perform well on small and carefully
curated datasets. In contrast, end-to-end pipelines aim to automate the process
by learning features directly from document images. However, our experiments
show that many of these models struggle to generalise in more realistic,
document-level settings, especially under zero-shot scenarios where writers in
the test set are not present in the training data. We explore different
combinations of pre-processing methods, backbone architectures, and
post-processing strategies, including text segmentation, patch sampling, and
feature aggregation. The results suggest that most configurations perform
poorly due to weak capture of low-level visual features, inconsistent patch
representations, and high sensitivity to content noise. Still, we identify one
end-to-end setup that achieves results comparable to the top-performing system,
despite using a simpler design. These findings point to key challenges in
building robust end-to-end systems and offer insight into design choices that
improve performance in historical document writer identification.

TL;DR: MoGA (Mixture-of-Groups Attention) is a sparse attention mechanism that uses learnable token routing to enable efficient long video generation with Diffusion Transformers, overcoming quadratic attention scaling limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long video generation with Diffusion Transformers is limited by the quadratic scaling of full attention with sequence length, and existing sparse methods using blockwise estimation have constrained accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

Method: Proposes Mixture-of-Groups Attention (MoGA) - a sparse attention mechanism with lightweight, learnable token router for precise token matching without blockwise estimation. It enables semantic-aware routing for effective long-range interactions and integrates with modern attention stacks like FlashAttention.

Result: Developed an efficient long video generation model that produces minute-level, multi-shot, 480p videos at 24 fps with context length of approximately 580k. Comprehensive experiments validate effectiveness across various video generation tasks.

Conclusion: MoGA provides an effective solution for efficient long video generation by addressing attention redundancy through semantic-aware token routing, enabling practical minute-level video generation with Diffusion Transformers.

Abstract: Long video generation with Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) is bottlenecked by
the quadratic scaling of full attention with sequence length. Since attention
is highly redundant, outputs are dominated by a small subset of query-key
pairs. Existing sparse methods rely on blockwise coarse estimation, whose
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs are constrained by block size. This paper
introduces Mixture-of-Groups Attention (MoGA), an efficient sparse attention
that uses a lightweight, learnable token router to precisely match tokens
without blockwise estimation. Through semantic-aware routing, MoGA enables
effective long-range interactions. As a kernel-free method, MoGA integrates
seamlessly with modern attention stacks, including FlashAttention and sequence
parallelism. Building on MoGA, we develop an efficient long video generation
model that end-to-end produces minute-level, multi-shot, 480p videos at 24 fps,
with a context length of approximately 580k. Comprehensive experiments on
various video generation tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: UniGenBench++ is a unified semantic assessment benchmark for text-to-image generation that addresses limitations in existing benchmarks by providing diverse prompt scenarios, multilingual support, and fine-grained evaluation across multiple dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image evaluation benchmarks lack diversity in prompt scenarios, multilingual support, and fine-grained assessment capabilities, limiting their real-world applicability and comprehensive model evaluation.

Method: Developed a benchmark with 600 prompts organized hierarchically across 5 main themes and 20 subthemes, with English and Chinese versions in short and long forms. Used Gemini-2.5-Pro MLLM for reliable benchmark construction and assessment, and trained an offline evaluation model for community use.

Result: The benchmark enables comprehensive evaluation of both open- and closed-source T2I models, systematically revealing their strengths and weaknesses across various semantic consistency dimensions.

Conclusion: UniGenBench++ provides a more comprehensive and practical evaluation framework for text-to-image generation models, addressing key limitations of existing benchmarks and facilitating better model assessment across diverse real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generation underscores the importance
of reliable benchmarks in evaluating how accurately generated images reflect
the semantics of their textual prompt. However, (1) existing benchmarks lack
the diversity of prompt scenarios and multilingual support, both essential for
real-world applicability; (2) they offer only coarse evaluations across primary
dimensions, covering a narrow range of sub-dimensions, and fall short in
fine-grained sub-dimension assessment. To address these limitations, we
introduce UniGenBench++, a unified semantic assessment benchmark for T2I
generation. Specifically, it comprises 600 prompts organized hierarchically to
ensure both coverage and efficiency: (1) spans across diverse real-world
scenarios, i.e., 5 main prompt themes and 20 subthemes; (2) comprehensively
probes T2I models' semantic consistency over 10 primary and 27 sub evaluation
criteria, with each prompt assessing multiple testpoints. To rigorously assess
model robustness to variations in language and prompt length, we provide both
English and Chinese versions of each prompt in short and long forms. Leveraging
the general world knowledge and fine-grained image understanding capabilities
of a closed-source Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM), i.e.,
Gemini-2.5-Pro, an effective pipeline is developed for reliable benchmark
construction and streamlined model assessment. Moreover, to further facilitate
community use, we train a robust evaluation model that enables offline
assessment of T2I model outputs. Through comprehensive benchmarking of both
open- and closed-sourced T2I models, we systematically reveal their strengths
and weaknesses across various aspects.

*Yiqi Lin,Alex Jinpeng Wang,Linjie Li,Zhengyuan Yang,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VC2L is a vision-centric contrastive learning framework that models text, images, and their combinations using a single vision transformer, rendering all inputs as images to eliminate the need for OCR, text tokenization, or modality fusion strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing contrastive vision-language models like CLIP struggle with complex real-world web documents where text and images are interleaved, loosely aligned, or embedded in visual form, limiting their effectiveness in these scenarios.

Method: VC2L operates entirely in pixel space by rendering all inputs as images and employs snippet-level contrastive learning to align consecutive multimodal segments, leveraging document coherence without requiring explicitly paired image-text data.

Result: VC2L achieves competitive or superior performance compared to CLIP-style models on both proposed benchmarks (AnyCIR, SeqCIR, CSR) and established datasets like M-BEIR and MTEB.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate the potential of multimodal web data as valuable training resource and illustrate the scalability of unified vision-centric approaches for multimodal representation learning.

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong
performance across a wide range of multimodal tasks by learning from aligned
image-text pairs. However, their ability to handle complex, real-world web
documents remains limited, particularly in scenarios where text and images are
interleaved, loosely aligned, or embedded in visual form. To address these
challenges, we propose Vision-Centric Contrastive Learning (VC2L), a unified
framework that models text, images, and their combinations using a single
vision transformer. VC2L operates entirely in pixel space by rendering all
inputs, whether textual, visual, or combined, as images, thus eliminating the
need for OCR, text tokenization, or modality fusion strategy. To capture
complex cross-modal relationships in multimodal web documents, VC2L employs a
snippet-level contrastive learning objective that aligns consecutive multimodal
segments, leveraging the inherent coherence of documents without requiring
explicitly paired image-text data. To assess the effectiveness of this
approach, we introduce three retrieval benchmarks, AnyCIR, SeqCIR, and CSR,
designed to evaluate cross-modal retrieval, fine-grained sequential
understanding, and generalization to unseen data, respectively. Empirical
results show that VC2L achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
CLIP-style models on both the proposed benchmarks and established datasets such
as M-BEIR and MTEB. These findings underscore the potential of multimodal web
data as a valuable training resource for contrastive learning and illustrate
the scalability of a unified, vision-centric approach for multimodal
representation learning. Code and models are available at:

*Peiqin Zhuang,Lei Bai,Yichao Wu,Ding Liang,Luping Zhou,Yali Wang,Wanli Ouyang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes EMIM, a module that integrates cost volume-style motion modeling into transformers for improved action recognition, especially on motion-sensitive datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based methods dominate action recognition but perform poorly on motion-sensitive datasets due to lack of elaborate motion modeling designs. Cost volume in traditional methods has powerful motion modeling capacities similar to attention affinity matrices.

Method: Proposes Explicit Motion Information Mining (EMIM) module that constructs affinity matrix in cost volume style - sampling key tokens from query-based neighboring areas in next frame using sliding window. This matrix handles both contextual aggregation for appearance and motion feature extraction.

Result: Validated on four datasets, outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially on motion-sensitive Something-Something V1 & V2 datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating cost volume-style motion modeling into transformers through EMIM effectively improves motion modeling capacities for action recognition.

Abstract: Recently, action recognition has been dominated by transformer-based methods,
thanks to their spatiotemporal contextual aggregation capacities. However,
despite the significant progress achieved on scene-related datasets, they do
not perform well on motion-sensitive datasets due to the lack of elaborate
motion modeling designs. Meanwhile, we observe that the widely-used cost volume
in traditional action recognition is highly similar to the affinity matrix
defined in self-attention, but equipped with powerful motion modeling
capacities. In light of this, we propose to integrate those effective motion
modeling properties into the existing transformer in a unified and neat way,
with the proposal of the Explicit Motion Information Mining module (EMIM). In
EMIM, we propose to construct the desirable affinity matrix in a cost volume
style, where the set of key candidate tokens is sampled from the query-based
neighboring area in the next frame in a sliding-window manner. Then, the
constructed affinity matrix is used to aggregate contextual information for
appearance modeling and is converted into motion features for motion modeling
as well. We validate the motion modeling capacities of our method on four
widely-used datasets, and our method performs better than existing
state-of-the-art approaches, especially on motion-sensitive datasets, i.e.,
Something-Something V1 & V2.

*Changkun Liu,Bin Tan,Zeran Ke,Shangzhan Zhang,Jiachen Liu,Ming Qian,Nan Xue,Yujun Shen,Tristan Braud*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PLANA3R is a pose-free framework for metric 3D reconstruction from unposed two-view images using planar primitives, trained without 3D plane annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address metric 3D reconstruction of indoor scenes by exploiting geometric regularities with compact planar representations, avoiding the need for 3D plane annotations during training.

Method: Uses Vision Transformers to extract sparse planar primitives, estimate relative camera poses, and supervises geometry learning via planar splatting with depth and normal maps.

Result: Validated on multiple indoor datasets with strong generalization to out-of-domain environments, achieving accurate 3D surface reconstruction, depth estimation, pose estimation, and plane segmentation.

Conclusion: PLANA3R enables scalable training on large-scale stereo datasets without explicit plane supervision, demonstrating robust performance across diverse metric evaluation tasks.

Abstract: This paper addresses metric 3D reconstruction of indoor scenes by exploiting
their inherent geometric regularities with compact representations. Using
planar 3D primitives - a well-suited representation for man-made environments -
we introduce PLANA3R, a pose-free framework for metric Planar 3D Reconstruction
from unposed two-view images. Our approach employs Vision Transformers to
extract a set of sparse planar primitives, estimate relative camera poses, and
supervise geometry learning via planar splatting, where gradients are
propagated through high-resolution rendered depth and normal maps of
primitives. Unlike prior feedforward methods that require 3D plane annotations
during training, PLANA3R learns planar 3D structures without explicit plane
supervision, enabling scalable training on large-scale stereo datasets using
only depth and normal annotations. We validate PLANA3R on multiple indoor-scene
datasets with metric supervision and demonstrate strong generalization to
out-of-domain indoor environments across diverse tasks under metric evaluation
protocols, including 3D surface reconstruction, depth estimation, and relative
pose estimation. Furthermore, by formulating with planar 3D representation, our
method emerges with the ability for accurate plane segmentation. The project

*Siyong Jian,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel KV cache compression framework for autoregressive image generation that reduces memory usage by 5x and speeds up throughput by 6.6x with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive image generation models like Janus-Pro have high memory and computational costs due to large numbers of visual tokens, and KV cache compression remains unexplored in image generation.

Method: Identifies spatial locality and emergent semantic sink phenomena, then compresses KV cache by adaptively decoupling attention heads into two types: spatial-locality heads maintain short recent token windows, while semantic-sink heads preserve compact sets of highly-attended tokens.

Result: Achieves 5x reduction in memory usage and 6.6x speedup in overall throughput with only minimal visual quality loss.

Conclusion: Enables highly efficient native autoregressive image generation on resource-constrained hardware through effective KV cache compression.

Abstract: Autoregressive image generation models like Janus-Pro produce high-quality
images, but at the significant cost of high memory and ever-growing
computational demands due to the large number of visual tokens. While KV cache
compression has been extensively studied in language modeling, it still remains
largely unexplored for the image generation domain. In this work, we begin by
identifying a distinct and prominent attention phenomenon, which we term
spatial locality and emergent semantic sink. To leverage this key insight, we
introduce a novel KV cache compression framework. Specifically, we compress the
KV cache for all visual tokens by adaptively decoupling attention heads into
two separate types: for spatial-locality heads, our method maintains a short
recent token window; for semantic-sink heads, it strategically preserves a
compact set of highly-attended tokens. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that the proposed method achieves a 5$\times$ reduction in memory usage and a
notable 6.6$\times$ speedup in overall throughput with only minimal visual
quality loss, thereby enabling highly efficient native autoregressive image
generation on resource-constrained hardware.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IF-VidCap is a new benchmark for evaluating controllable video captioning that assesses both format and content correctness, revealing that while proprietary models still lead, open-source solutions are closing the gap and dense captioning models underperform on complex instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video captioning benchmarks focus on descriptive comprehensiveness but overlook instruction-following capabilities, which are crucial for practical applications where users need specific caption formats rather than exhaustive descriptions.

Method: Introduced IF-VidCap benchmark with 1,400 high-quality samples and a systematic evaluation framework that assesses captions on two dimensions: format correctness and content correctness.

Result: Evaluation of over 20 models shows proprietary models still dominate but the gap is closing, with top open-source solutions achieving near-parity. Dense captioning models underperform general-purpose MLLMs on complex instructions.

Conclusion: Future work should advance both descriptive richness and instruction-following fidelity simultaneously, as specialized dense captioning models are not sufficient for complex instruction-following tasks.

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
proficiency in video captioning, practical applications require captions that
follow specific user instructions rather than generating exhaustive,
unconstrained descriptions. Current benchmarks, however, primarily assess
descriptive comprehensiveness while largely overlooking instruction-following
capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce IF-VidCap, a new benchmark for
evaluating controllable video captioning, which contains 1,400 high-quality
samples. Distinct from existing video captioning or general
instruction-following benchmarks, IF-VidCap incorporates a systematic framework
that assesses captions on two dimensions: format correctness and content
correctness. Our comprehensive evaluation of over 20 prominent models reveals a
nuanced landscape: despite the continued dominance of proprietary models, the
performance gap is closing, with top-tier open-source solutions now achieving
near-parity. Furthermore, we find that models specialized for dense captioning
underperform general-purpose MLLMs on complex instructions, indicating that
future work should simultaneously advance both descriptive richness and
instruction-following fidelity.

*Hao Wang,Ying Zhou,Haoyu Zhao,Rui Wang,Qiang Hu,Xing Zhang,Qiang Li,Zhiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ColIAGS is an improved 3D Gaussian Splatting framework for colonoscopy that addresses illumination variations by modeling light attenuation and enhancing geometry prediction, achieving superior view synthesis and geometric reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard 3DGS assumes static illumination, which is incompatible with dynamic lighting in colonoscopy, leading to degraded 3D reconstructions with vaporous Gaussian blobs that violate scene structure.

Method: Proposes Improved Appearance Modeling with two illumination attenuation factors, Improved Geometry Modeling using high-dimensional view embedding, and cosine embedding for implicit illumination attenuation solutions.

Result: Achieves dual capabilities of novel view synthesis and accurate geometric reconstruction, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with superior rendering fidelity and significantly reduced Depth MSE.

Conclusion: ColIAGS successfully adapts 3DGS to colonoscopic scenes with dynamic illumination while preserving geometry accuracy, demonstrating practical improvements for medical applications like virtual colonoscopy.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a pivotal technique for real-time
view synthesis in colonoscopy, enabling critical applications such as virtual
colonoscopy and lesion tracking. However, the vanilla 3DGS assumes static
illumination and that observed appearance depends solely on viewing angle,
which causes incompatibility with the photometric variations in colonoscopic
scenes induced by dynamic light source/camera. This mismatch forces most 3DGS
methods to introduce structure-violating vaporous Gaussian blobs between the
camera and tissues to compensate for illumination attenuation, ultimately
degrading the quality of 3D reconstructions. Previous works only consider the
illumination attenuation caused by light distance, ignoring the physical
characters of light source and camera. In this paper, we propose ColIAGS, an
improved 3DGS framework tailored for colonoscopy. To mimic realistic appearance
under varying illumination, we introduce an Improved Appearance Modeling with
two types of illumination attenuation factors, which enables Gaussians to adapt
to photometric variations while preserving geometry accuracy. To ensure the
geometry approximation condition of appearance modeling, we propose an Improved
Geometry Modeling using high-dimensional view embedding to enhance Gaussian
geometry attribute prediction. Furthermore, another cosine embedding input is
leveraged to generate illumination attenuation solutions in an implicit manner.
Comprehensive experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
proposed ColIAGS achieves the dual capabilities of novel view synthesis and
accurate geometric reconstruction. It notably outperforms other
state-of-the-art methods by achieving superior rendering fidelity while
significantly reducing Depth MSE. Code will be available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEAL framework for Generalized Category Discovery using hierarchical semantic structures to improve classification of unlabeled images across known and unknown classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCD methods rely on single-level semantics or manual hierarchies, limiting generalizability and scalability.

Method: Hierarchical Semantic-Guided Soft Contrastive Learning with informative soft negatives and Cross-Granularity Consistency module for alignment.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on fine-grained benchmarks (SSB, Oxford-Pet, Herbarium19) and generalization on coarse-grained datasets.

Conclusion: SEAL effectively addresses GCD limitations through hierarchical semantic guidance and cross-granularity consistency.

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD).
Given a partially labelled dataset, GCD aims to categorize all unlabelled
images, regardless of whether they belong to known or unknown classes. Existing
approaches typically depend on either single-level semantics or manually
designed abstract hierarchies, which limit their generalizability and
scalability. To address these limitations, we introduce a SEmantic-aware
hierArchical Learning framework (SEAL), guided by naturally occurring and
easily accessible hierarchical structures. Within SEAL, we propose a
Hierarchical Semantic-Guided Soft Contrastive Learning approach that exploits
hierarchical similarity to generate informative soft negatives, addressing the
limitations of conventional contrastive losses that treat all negatives
equally. Furthermore, a Cross-Granularity Consistency (CGC) module is designed
to align the predictions from different levels of granularity. SEAL
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on fine-grained benchmarks,
including the SSB benchmark, Oxford-Pet, and the Herbarium19 dataset, and
further demonstrates generalization on coarse-grained datasets. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geospatial foundation models fine-tuned on limited data can accurately predict urban heat patterns and evaluate mitigation strategies for climate-resilient cities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban heat island effects are worsening due to urbanization and climate change, but conventional ML models with limited data produce inaccurate predictions, especially in underserved areas.

Method: Fine-tuned geospatial foundation models trained on global unstructured data to predict land surface temperatures under future climate scenarios, using empirical ground truth from green space cooling effects.

Result: Foundation models demonstrate strong generalization and accurate predictions of urban heat patterns, enabling evaluation of mitigation strategies in data-scarce regions.

Conclusion: Geospatial foundation models offer a powerful approach for assessing urban heat island mitigation strategies to support climate-resilient urban planning.

Abstract: As urbanization and climate change progress, urban heat island effects are
becoming more frequent and severe. To formulate effective mitigation plans,
cities require detailed air temperature data, yet conventional machine learning
models with limited data often produce inaccurate predictions, particularly in
underserved areas. Geospatial foundation models trained on global unstructured
data offer a promising alternative by demonstrating strong generalization and
requiring only minimal fine-tuning. In this study, an empirical ground truth of
urban heat patterns is established by quantifying cooling effects from green
spaces and benchmarking them against model predictions to evaluate the model's
accuracy. The foundation model is subsequently fine-tuned to predict land
surface temperatures under future climate scenarios, and its practical value is
demonstrated through a simulated inpainting that highlights its role for
mitigation support. The results indicate that foundation models offer a
powerful way for evaluating urban heat island mitigation strategies in
data-scarce regions to support more climate-resilient cities.

*Teng Hu,Jiangning Zhang,Zihan Su,Ran Yi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UltraGen enables efficient end-to-end native high-resolution video generation (up to 4K) by addressing computational bottlenecks in existing diffusion transformer models through hierarchical dual-branch attention architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion transformer video generation models are limited to low-resolution outputs (≤720P) due to quadratic computational complexity of attention mechanisms, making native high-resolution video generation impractical.

Method: Proposes UltraGen with hierarchical dual-branch attention: global attention branch for semantic consistency with spatial compression, and local attention branch with hierarchical cross-window mechanism for regional content fidelity.

Result: UltraGen successfully scales pre-trained low-resolution video models to 1080P and 4K resolution, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and super-resolution pipelines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: UltraGen provides an effective solution for native high-resolution video generation by overcoming computational limitations through innovative attention decomposition strategies.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have made it possible to produce visually
compelling videos, with wide-ranging applications in content creation,
entertainment, and virtual reality. However, most existing diffusion
transformer based video generation models are limited to low-resolution outputs
(<=720P) due to the quadratic computational complexity of the attention
mechanism with respect to the output width and height. This computational
bottleneck makes native high-resolution video generation (1080P/2K/4K)
impractical for both training and inference. To address this challenge, we
present UltraGen, a novel video generation framework that enables i) efficient
and ii) end-to-end native high-resolution video synthesis. Specifically,
UltraGen features a hierarchical dual-branch attention architecture based on
global-local attention decomposition, which decouples full attention into a
local attention branch for high-fidelity regional content and a global
attention branch for overall semantic consistency. We further propose a
spatially compressed global modeling strategy to efficiently learn global
dependencies, and a hierarchical cross-window local attention mechanism to
reduce computational costs while enhancing information flow across different
local windows. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UltraGen can effectively
scale pre-trained low-resolution video models to 1080P and even 4K resolution
for the first time, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods and
super-resolution based two-stage pipelines in both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations.

*Wenping Jin,Yuyang Tang,Li Zhu,Fei Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel "Rebellious Student" framework for hyperspectral anomaly detection that trains spatial and spectral branches to learn complementary features through intentional divergence rather than imitation, enabling parameter-free deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve hyperspectral anomaly detection by integrating spectral and spatial cues through complementary feature learning, building on universal detection methods that don't require per-scene retraining.

Method: Two-stage learning: (1) train spectral enhancement network via reverse distillation for robust spectral representations; (2) train spatial network as "rebellious student" using decorrelation losses to enforce feature orthogonality while maintaining reconstruction fidelity.

Result: Extensive experiments on HAD100 benchmark show substantial improvements over established baselines with minimal computational overhead, confirming effectiveness and generality.

Conclusion: The proposed complementary learning paradigm successfully enhances both spectral and spatial background features, enabling parameter-free and training-free anomaly detection when paired with conventional detectors.

Abstract: A recent class of hyperspectral anomaly detection methods that can be trained
once on background datasets and then universally deployed -- without per-scene
retraining or parameter tuning -- has demonstrated remarkable efficiency and
robustness. Building upon this paradigm, we focus on the integration of
spectral and spatial cues and introduce a novel "Rebellious Student" framework
for complementary feature learning. Unlike conventional teacher-student
paradigms driven by imitation, our method intentionally trains the spatial
branch to diverge from the spectral teacher, thereby learning complementary
spatial patterns that the teacher fails to capture. A two-stage learning
strategy is adopted: (1) a spectral enhancement network is first trained via
reverse distillation to obtain robust background spectral representations; and
(2) a spatial network -- the rebellious student -- is subsequently optimized
using decorrelation losses that enforce feature orthogonality while maintaining
reconstruction fidelity to avoid irrelevant noise. Once trained, the framework
enhances both spectral and spatial background features, enabling parameter-free
and training-free anomaly detection when paired with conventional detectors.
Extensive experiments on the HAD100 benchmark show substantial improvements
over several established baselines with minimal computational overhead,
confirming the effectiveness and generality of the proposed complementary
learning paradigm. Our code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProCLIP is a curriculum learning framework that progressively aligns CLIP's image encoder with LLM-based text embedders to handle long texts and multilingual inputs while preserving CLIP's original vision-language alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP's text encoder has limitations: 77-token input limit, no multilingual support, and poor fine-grained semantic understanding. Direct replacement with LLM embedders disrupts CLIP's pre-trained vision-language alignment.

Method: ProCLIP uses curriculum learning: 1) Knowledge distillation from CLIP text encoder to LLM embedder, 2) Image-text contrastive tuning with self-distillation regularization, 3) Instance semantic alignment and embedding structure alignment losses.

Result: The framework effectively aligns CLIP image encoder with LLM-based embedders while preserving original vision-language alignment, enabling better long-text processing and multilingual understanding.

Conclusion: ProCLIP successfully bridges CLIP's vision-language space with LLM representations through progressive alignment, overcoming limitations of direct replacement approaches and maintaining pre-trained knowledge.

Abstract: The original CLIP text encoder is limited by a maximum input length of 77
tokens, which hampers its ability to effectively process long texts and perform
fine-grained semantic understanding. In addition, the CLIP text encoder lacks
support for multilingual inputs. All these limitations significantly restrict
its applicability across a broader range of tasks. Recent studies have
attempted to replace the CLIP text encoder with an LLM-based embedder to
enhance its ability in processing long texts, multilingual understanding, and
fine-grained semantic comprehension. However, because the representation spaces
of LLMs and the vision-language space of CLIP are pretrained independently
without alignment priors, direct alignment using contrastive learning can
disrupt the intrinsic vision-language alignment in the CLIP image encoder,
leading to an underutilization of the knowledge acquired during pre-training.
To address this challenge, we propose ProCLIP, a curriculum learning-based
progressive vision-language alignment framework to effectively align the CLIP
image encoder with an LLM-based embedder. Specifically, ProCLIP first distills
knowledge from CLIP's text encoder into the LLM-based embedder to leverage
CLIP's rich pretrained knowledge while establishing initial alignment between
the LLM embedder and CLIP image encoder. Subsequently, ProCLIP further aligns
the CLIP image encoder with the LLM-based embedder through image-text
contrastive tuning, employing self-distillation regularization to avoid
overfitting. To achieve a more effective alignment, instance semantic alignment
loss and embedding structure alignment loss are employed during representation
inheritance and contrastive tuning. The Code is available at

Method: Geometric arguments and fundamental pattern matching principles; novel construction using interpolation kernels that improve upon existing implementations.

Result: More intuitive understanding of steerable CNNs; improved robustness to noisy data through the proposed interpolation kernel approach.

Conclusion: The work successfully provides an intuitive geometric derivation of steerable CNNs and introduces improved interpolation kernels that enhance robustness.

Abstract: In contrast to the somewhat abstract, group theoretical approach adopted by
many papers, our work provides a new and more intuitive derivation of steerable
convolutional neural networks in $d$ dimensions. This derivation is based on
geometric arguments and fundamental principles of pattern matching. We offer an
intuitive explanation for the appearance of the Clebsch--Gordan decomposition
and spherical harmonic basis functions. Furthermore, we suggest a novel way to
construct steerable convolution layers using interpolation kernels that improve
upon existing implementation, and offer greater robustness to noisy data.

Motivation: Tuberculosis is a global health issue, especially in resource-limited areas where skilled radiologists are scarce, creating need for AI-driven screening tools. Developing reliable AI models is challenging due to the high cost of obtaining large, high-quality datasets.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates promise for deployment in clinical screening and triage settings, particularly in resource-limited areas.

Abstract: Tuberculosis remains a critical global health issue, particularly in
resource-limited and remote areas. Early detection is vital for treatment, yet
the lack of skilled radiologists underscores the need for artificial

98.85% for distinguishing between COVID-19, tuberculosis, and normal cases, and

TL;DR: SAM 2++ is a unified video tracking model that handles tracking at any granularity (masks, boxes, points) through task-specific prompts, unified decoder, and task-adaptive memory mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse tracking tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing trackers are tailored to single tasks with custom-designed modules, limiting generalization and causing redundancy in model design and parameters. There's a need to unify video tracking tasks across different granularities.

Method: 1) Task-specific prompts to encode various inputs into general embeddings; 2) Unified decoder to standardize diverse task outputs; 3) Task-adaptive memory mechanism for unified memory matching; 4) Customized data engine producing Tracking-Any-Granularity dataset with rich annotations.

Result: SAM 2++ sets new state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks for diverse tracking tasks at different granularities, demonstrating superior generalization capability.

Conclusion: SAM 2++ establishes a unified and robust tracking framework that effectively handles tracking at any granularity, overcoming limitations of task-specific trackers and providing comprehensive tracking capabilities.

Abstract: Video tracking aims at finding the specific target in subsequent frames given
its initial state. Due to the varying granularity of target states across
different tasks, most existing trackers are tailored to a single task and
heavily rely on custom-designed modules within the individual task, which
limits their generalization and leads to redundancy in both model design and
parameters. To unify video tracking tasks, we present SAM 2++, a unified model
towards tracking at any granularity, including masks, boxes, and points. First,
to extend target granularity, we design task-specific prompts to encode various
task inputs into general prompt embeddings, and a unified decoder to unify
diverse task results into a unified form pre-output. Next, to satisfy memory
matching, the core operation of tracking, we introduce a task-adaptive memory
mechanism that unifies memory across different granularities. Finally, we
introduce a customized data engine to support tracking training at any
granularity, producing a large and diverse video tracking dataset with rich
annotations at three granularities, termed Tracking-Any-Granularity, which
represents a comprehensive resource for training and benchmarking on unified
tracking. Comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks confirm that SAM 2++
sets a new state of the art across diverse tracking tasks at different
granularities, establishing a unified and robust tracking framework.

TL;DR: Proposes M3Dphormer, a unified hierarchical mask framework for Graph Transformers that reveals equivalence between architecture and attention masks, enabling flexible modeling of diverse node interactions through theoretically grounded mask designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Graph Transformers rely on intricate architectural designs tailored to specific interactions, limiting flexibility. Need a unified approach to model diverse node interactions more effectively.

Method: Introduces M3Dphormer with hierarchical mask framework, three theoretically grounded masks, bi-level expert routing for adaptive integration, and dual attention computation that switches between dense/sparse modes based on mask sparsity.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of the unified framework and model design.

Conclusion: The unified hierarchical mask framework provides a consistent modeling paradigm for Graph Transformers, with M3Dphormer achieving superior performance by effectively integrating complementary hierarchical masks through adaptive routing and efficient computation.

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for graph
representation learning due to their ability to model diverse node
interactions. However, existing GTs often rely on intricate architectural
designs tailored to specific interactions, limiting their flexibility. To
address this, we propose a unified hierarchical mask framework that reveals an
underlying equivalence between model architecture and attention mask
construction. This framework enables a consistent modeling paradigm by
capturing diverse interactions through carefully designed attention masks.
Theoretical analysis under this framework demonstrates that the probability of
correct classification positively correlates with the receptive field size and
label consistency, leading to a fundamental design principle: an effective
attention mask should ensure both a sufficiently large receptive field and a
high level of label consistency. While no single existing mask satisfies this
principle across all scenarios, our analysis reveals that hierarchical masks
offer complementary strengths, motivating their effective integration. Then, we
introduce M3Dphormer, a Mixture-of-Experts-based Graph Transformer with
Multi-Level Masking and Dual Attention Computation. M3Dphormer incorporates
three theoretically grounded hierarchical masks and employs a bi-level expert
routing mechanism to adaptively integrate multi-level interaction information.
To ensure scalability, we further introduce a dual attention computation scheme
that dynamically switches between dense and sparse modes based on local mask
sparsity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
M3Dphormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness
of our unified framework and model design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedDEAP is an adaptive federated prompt tuning framework that enhances CLIP's generalization in multi-domain federated learning by disentangling semantic and domain features, using dual-prompt design, and aligning visual-textual representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning faces challenges with domain shift and label heterogeneity across clients, which hinder global model generalization. CLIP's strong zero-shot capabilities raise the question of how to effectively fine-tune it across domains in federated settings.

Method: Three key components: (1) Disentangle semantic and domain-specific features using transformation networks with unbiased mappings; (2) Dual-prompt design with global semantic prompt and local domain prompt; (3) Align textual and visual representations under learned transformations to preserve semantic and domain consistency.

Result: Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FedDEAP in enhancing CLIP's generalization for federated image recognition across multiple domains.

Conclusion: FedDEAP successfully addresses domain shift and heterogeneity issues in federated learning by adaptively tuning CLIP prompts while preserving both semantic and domain-specific knowledge.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train
machine learning models without exposing local data, balancing performance and
privacy. However, domain shift and label heterogeneity across clients often
hinder the generalization of the aggregated global model. Recently, large-scale
vision-language models like CLIP have shown strong zero-shot classification
capabilities, raising the question of how to effectively fine-tune CLIP across
domains in a federated setting. In this work, we propose an adaptive federated
prompt tuning framework, FedDEAP, to enhance CLIP's generalization in
multi-domain scenarios. Our method includes the following three key components:
(1) To mitigate the loss of domain-specific information caused by
label-supervised tuning, we disentangle semantic and domain-specific features
in images by using semantic and domain transformation networks with unbiased
mappings; (2) To preserve domain-specific knowledge during global prompt

and a local domain prompt to balance shared and personalized information; (3)
To maximize the inclusion of semantic and domain information from images in the
generated text features, we align textual and visual representations under the

*Ling Xing,Alex Jinpeng Wang,Rui Yan,Hongyu Qu,Zechao Li,Jinhui Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeeTok challenges traditional subword tokenization by rendering text as images and using multimodal LLMs to interpret visual-text, achieving comparable performance with 4.43x fewer tokens and 70.5% FLOPs reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human reading relies on visual word recognition, while current LLMs use subword tokenization that fragments text, especially problematic for low-resource languages and computationally inefficient.

Method: SeeTok renders text as images (visual-text) and leverages pretrained multimodal LLMs' OCR and text-vision alignment capabilities learned from large-scale multimodal training.

Result: SeeTok matches or surpasses subword tokenizers across three language tasks while requiring 4.43x fewer tokens and reducing FLOPs by 70.5%, with additional gains in cross-lingual generalization, robustness to noise, and linguistic hierarchy.

Conclusion: SeeTok represents a shift from symbolic tokenization to human-like visual reading, moving toward more natural and cognitively inspired language models.

Abstract: People see text. Humans read by recognizing words as visual objects,
including their shapes, layouts, and patterns, before connecting them to
meaning, which enables us to handle typos, distorted fonts, and various scripts
effectively. Modern large language models (LLMs), however, rely on subword
tokenization, fragmenting text into pieces from a fixed vocabulary. While
effective for high-resource languages, this approach over-segments low-resource
languages, yielding long, linguistically meaningless sequences and inflating
computation. In this work, we challenge this entrenched paradigm and move
toward a vision-centric alternative. Our method, SeeTok, renders text as images
(visual-text) and leverages pretrained multimodal LLMs to interpret them,
reusing strong OCR and text-vision alignment abilities learned from large-scale
multimodal training. Across three different language tasks, SeeTok matches or
surpasses subword tokenizers while requiring 4.43 times fewer tokens and
reducing FLOPs by 70.5%, with additional gains in cross-lingual generalization,
robustness to typographic noise, and linguistic hierarchy. SeeTok signals a
shift from symbolic tokenization to human-like visual reading, and takes a step
toward more natural and cognitively inspired language models.

*Rongyuan Wu,Lingchen Sun,Zhengqiang Zhang,Shihao Wang,Tianhe Wu,Qiaosi Yi,Shuai Li,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DP²O-SR is a framework that optimizes real-world image super-resolution models using perceptual preferences without human annotations, leveraging multiple preference pairs and hierarchical optimization to improve perceptual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To exploit the perceptual quality range introduced by the stochasticity of text-to-image diffusion models in real-world image super-resolution, enabling better alignment with human perceptual preferences without costly manual annotation.

Method: Uses hybrid reward signals combining full-reference and no-reference IQA models, constructs multiple preference pairs from model outputs, and implements hierarchical preference optimization with adaptive weighting based on reward gaps and diversity.

Result: Significantly improves perceptual quality across both diffusion- and flow-based T2I backbones and generalizes well to real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: DP²O-SR effectively aligns generative models with perceptual preferences through automated reward signals and optimized selection strategies, demonstrating superior performance in real-world image super-resolution tasks.

Abstract: Benefiting from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, real-world
image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods can synthesize rich and realistic
details. However, due to the inherent stochasticity of T2I models, different
noise inputs often lead to outputs with varying perceptual quality. Although
this randomness is sometimes seen as a limitation, it also introduces a wider
perceptual quality range, which can be exploited to improve Real-ISR
performance. To this end, we introduce Direct Perceptual Preference
Optimization for Real-ISR (DP$^2$O-SR), a framework that aligns generative
models with perceptual preferences without requiring costly human annotations.
We construct a hybrid reward signal by combining full-reference and
no-reference image quality assessment (IQA) models trained on large-scale human
preference datasets. This reward encourages both structural fidelity and
natural appearance. To better utilize perceptual diversity, we move beyond the
standard best-vs-worst selection and construct multiple preference pairs from
outputs of the same model. Our analysis reveals that the optimal selection
ratio depends on model capacity: smaller models benefit from broader coverage,
while larger models respond better to stronger contrast in supervision.
Furthermore, we propose hierarchical preference optimization, which adaptively
weights training pairs based on intra-group reward gaps and inter-group
diversity, enabling more efficient and stable learning. Extensive experiments
across both diffusion- and flow-based T2I backbones demonstrate that DP$^2$O-SR
significantly improves perceptual quality and generalizes well to real-world
benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DSI-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating dynamic spatial intelligence in vision-language models, featuring 1,000 videos and 1,700 questions covering nine motion patterns to test reasoning about simultaneous observer and object motion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models excel in 2D tasks and static scenarios but have limited ability to understand dynamic 3D scenarios where both observers and objects move simultaneously.

Method: Created DSI-Bench with nearly 1,000 dynamic videos and over 1,700 manually annotated questions covering nine decoupled motion patterns, using spatially and temporally symmetric designs to reduce biases and systematically evaluate motion reasoning.

Result: Evaluation of 14 VLMs and expert models revealed key limitations: models conflate observer and object motion, exhibit semantic biases, and fail to accurately infer relative relationships in dynamic scenarios.

Conclusion: DSI-Bench provides valuable insights for developing general and expertise models with dynamic spatial intelligence, highlighting current limitations in understanding dynamic spatial relationships.

Abstract: Reasoning about dynamic spatial relationships is essential, as both observers
and objects often move simultaneously. Although vision-language models (VLMs)
and visual expertise models excel in 2D tasks and static scenarios, their
ability to fully understand dynamic 3D scenarios remains limited. We introduce
Dynamic Spatial Intelligence and propose DSI-Bench, a benchmark with nearly
1,000 dynamic videos and over 1,700 manually annotated questions covering nine
decoupled motion patterns of observers and objects. Spatially and temporally
symmetric designs reduce biases and enable systematic evaluation of models'
reasoning about self-motion and object motion. Our evaluation of 14 VLMs and
expert models reveals key limitations: models often conflate observer and
object motion, exhibit semantic biases, and fail to accurately infer relative
relationships in dynamic scenarios. Our DSI-Bench provides valuable findings
and insights about the future development of general and expertise models with

TL;DR: GAR (Grasp Any Region) is a region-level multimodal model that addresses limitations in fine-grained visual understanding by leveraging global contexts and modeling interactions between multiple regions, achieving advanced compositional reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with dense scenes requiring fine-grained analysis of intricate details and object relationships. Region-level MLLMs typically understand regions in isolation without considering crucial global contexts.

Method: GAR uses an effective RoI-aligned feature replay technique to support precise perception by leveraging global contexts, modeling interactions between multiple prompts, and achieving advanced compositional reasoning through active dialogue.

Result: GAR-1B outperforms DAM-3B by +4.5 on DLC-Bench for captioning, surpasses InternVL3-78B on GAR-Bench-VQA for relationship modeling, and GAR-8B zero-shot outperforms VideoRefer-7B on VideoRefer-BenchQ, showing strong transfer capabilities to videos.

Conclusion: GAR provides comprehensive region-level visual understanding by integrating global contexts and multi-region interactions, enabling advanced compositional reasoning and demonstrating strong performance across benchmarks with transferability to video domains.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at holistic
understanding, they struggle in capturing the dense world with complex scenes,
requiring fine-grained analysis of intricate details and object
inter-relationships. Region-level MLLMs have been a promising step. However,
previous attempts are generally optimized to understand given regions in
isolation, neglecting crucial global contexts. To address this, we introduce
Grasp Any Region (GAR) for comprehen- sive region-level visual understanding.
Empowered by an effective RoI-aligned feature replay technique, GAR supports
(1) precise perception by leveraging necessary global contexts, and (2)
modeling interactions between multiple prompts. Together, it then naturally
achieves (3) advanced compositional reasoning to answer specific free-form
questions about any region, shifting the paradigm from passive description to
active dialogue. Moreover, we construct GAR-Bench, which not only provides a
more accurate evaluation of single-region comprehension, but also, more
importantly, measures interactions and complex reasoning across multiple
regions. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GAR-1B not only maintains
the state-of-the-art captioning capabilities, e.g., outperforming DAM-3B +4.5
on DLC-Bench, but also excels at modeling relationships between multiple
prompts with advanced comprehension capabilities, even surpassing InternVL3-78B
on GAR-Bench-VQA. More importantly, our zero-shot GAR-8B even outperforms
in-domain VideoRefer-7B on VideoRefer-BenchQ, indicating its strong
capabilities can be easily transferred to videos.

*Binyu Tan,Zhiyuan Wang,Jinhao Duan,Kaidi Xu,Heng Tao Shen,Xiaoshuang Shi,Fumin Shen*

TL;DR: CLS is a risk-constrained framework that uses conformal prediction to calibrate data-driven thresholds for medical image segmentation, ensuring false negative rates remain below target tolerance with statistical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical segmentation models use fixed thresholds without statistical guarantees on false negative rates, undermining reliable deployment in high-stakes clinical applications like 3D lesion segmentation.

Method: CLS holds out a calibration set, defines FNR-specific loss function, identifies critical thresholds for each sample, and determines test-time confidence threshold as the approximate 1-α quantile of critical thresholds from calibration data.

Result: Validated on six 3D lesion segmentation datasets across five backbone models, CLS provides rigorous FNR constraint while yielding more precise and reliable segmentations.

Conclusion: CLS offers actionable insights for deploying risk-aware segmentation in clinical practice by generalizing statistical regularities from calibration data to new test data.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation serves as a critical component of precision
medicine, enabling accurate localization and delineation of pathological
regions, such as lesions. However, existing models empirically apply fixed
thresholds (e.g., 0.5) to differentiate lesions from the background, offering
no statistical guarantees on key metrics such as the false negative rate (FNR).
This lack of principled risk control undermines their reliable deployment in
high-stakes clinical applications, especially in challenging scenarios like 3D
lesion segmentation (3D-LS). To address this issue, we propose a
risk-constrained framework, termed Conformal Lesion Segmentation (CLS), that
calibrates data-driven thresholds via conformalization to ensure the test-time
FNR remains below a target tolerance $\varepsilon$ under desired risk levels.
CLS begins by holding out a calibration set to analyze the threshold setting
for each sample under the FNR tolerance, drawing on the idea of conformal
prediction. We define an FNR-specific loss function and identify the critical
threshold at which each calibration data point just satisfies the target
tolerance. Given a user-specified risk level $\alpha$, we then determine the
approximate $1-\alpha$ quantile of all the critical thresholds in the
calibration set as the test-time confidence threshold. By conformalizing such
critical thresholds, CLS generalizes the statistical regularities observed in
the calibration set to new test data, providing rigorous FNR constraint while
yielding more precise and reliable segmentations. We validate the statistical
soundness and predictive performance of CLS on six 3D-LS datasets across five
backbone models, and conclude with actionable insights for deploying risk-aware
segmentation in clinical practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify the information capacity of EEG recordings about latent cortical sources, as the quantitative information capacity of EEG remains unclear despite its widespread use in studying brain dynamics.

Method: Combined information theory and synthetic forward modeling to estimate mutual information between cortical sources and EEG recordings, using Gaussian-channel theory and empirical simulations.

Result: Scalp EEG conveys only tens of bits per sample about low-dimensional neural activity. Information saturates with 64-128 electrodes and scales logarithmically with SNR. Linear decoders capture nearly all linearly recoverable variance but remain far below analytic channel capacity.

Conclusion: Measurement physics is the dominant limitation on EEG information capacity, not algorithmic complexity, outlining an intrinsic ceiling on how much brain state or thought content can be inferred from EEG.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used to study human brain dynamics,
yet its quantitative information capacity remains unclear. Here, we combine
information theory and synthetic forward modeling to estimate the mutual
information between latent cortical sources and EEG recordings. Using
Gaussian-channel theory and empirical simulations, we find that scalp EEG
conveys only tens of bits per sample about low-dimensional neural activity.
Information saturates with approximately 64-128 electrodes and scales
logarithmically with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Linear decoders capture
nearly all variance that is linearly recoverable, but the mutual information
they recover remains far below the analytic channel capacity, indicating that
measurement physics - not algorithmic complexity - is the dominant limitation.
These results outline the intrinsic ceiling on how much structure about brain
state or thought content can be inferred from EEG.

*Bach Hung Luu,Samuel Harry Gardner,Sinh Cong Lam,Trong Minh Hoang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: A modified fractional frequency reuse algorithm uses power ratio between serving and second nearest BS for user classification, showing that increased power for cell-edge users improves their performance but degrades typical users' performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve user performance in 5G/B5G networks by mitigating intercell interference through better classification of cell-edge users (CEUs) and cell-center users (CCUs) using power ratio instead of traditional SINR or distance metrics.

Method: Proposes a modified frequency reuse algorithm that classifies users based on the power ratio between signal strengths from serving BS and second nearest BS. Users below threshold are classified as CEUs and served with higher transmission power.

Result: Simulation shows increasing transmission power enhances CEU performance but degrades typical users' performance. Frequency reuse algorithms work best in high-obstacle density environments where intercell interference can be effectively suppressed.

Conclusion: The power ratio-based classification method is effective for CEU identification, and frequency reuse algorithms are particularly suitable for environments with high obstacle density where interference suppression is more achievable.

Abstract: Mitigating intercell interference by employing fractional frequency reuse
algorithms is one of the important approaches to improving user performance in
5G and Beyond 5G cellular network systems, which typically have a high density
of Base Stations (BSs). While most frequency reuse algorithms are based on the
downlink Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) or the distance between
the user and its serving BS to classify Cell-Edge Users (CEUs) and Cell-Center
Users (CCUs), this paper discusses a modified algorithm that uses the power
ratio between the signal strengths from the serving BS and the second nearest
BS for user classification. Specifically, if the power ratio is below a
predefined threshold, the user is classified as a CEU and is served with higher
transmission power. Simulation results show that increasing transmission power
is necessary to enhance CEU performance, but it also degrades the performance
of typical users. The use of frequency reuse algorithms is particularly
feasible in environments with a high density of obstacles, where intercell
interference can be effectively suppressed.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper extends the Schnorr-Stimm theorem beyond normal numbers by providing a new information-theoretic characterization of finite-state dimension using conditional Kullback-Leibler divergence from Markov chain simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize the correspondence between Borel normal numbers and finite-state dimension to arbitrary sequences, moving beyond the limited case of normal numbers.

Method: Using conditional Kullback-Leibler divergence between limiting distributions from Markov chain simulations using sequences and their stationary distributions to characterize finite-state dimension.

Result: Established a new information-theoretic characterization of finite-state dimension that generalizes the Schnorr-Stimm result, and proved a quantitative generalization of Agafonov's theorem for arbitrary sequences.

Conclusion: The finite-state dimension of sequences can be characterized through information-theoretic measures related to Markov chain simulations, providing a framework that extends classical results beyond normal numbers to arbitrary sequences.

Abstract: Finite-state dimension quantifies the asymptotic rate of information in an
infinite sequence as perceived by finite automata. For a fixed alphabet, the
infinite sequences that have maximal finite-state dimension are exactly those
that are Borel normal, i.e., in which all words of any given length appear with
the same frequency. A theorem of Schnorr and Stimm (1972) shows that a real
number is Borel normal if and only if, for every finite-state irreducible
Markov chain with fair transitions, when the chain is simulated using the
binary expansion of the given number, the empirical distribution of states
converges to its stationary distribution. In this paper we extend this
correspondence beyond normal numbers. We show that the finite-state dimension
of a sequence can be characterized in terms of the conditional Kullback-Leibler
divergence between the limiting distributions arising from the simulation of
Markov chains using the given sequence and their stationary distributions. This
provides a new information-theoretic characterization of finite-state dimension
which generalizes the Schnorr-Stimm result.
  As an application, we prove a generalization of Agafonov's theorem for normal
numbers. Agafonov's theorem states that a sequence is normal if and only if
every subsequence selected by a finite automaton is also normal. We extend this
to arbitrary sequences by establishing a tight quantitative relationship
between the finite-state dimension of a sequence and the finite-state
dimensions of its automatic subsequences.

TL;DR: CAST enables transfer of LoRA-encoded behaviors between different LLM architectures by learning nonlinear mappings between activation manifolds, achieving 85-95% performance of full retraining without task-specific data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome architectural lock-in where valuable behaviors learned through LoRA fine-tuning are trapped within specific model architectures, as existing weight-space transfer methods are brittle and indirect.

Method: Learn lightweight bidirectional projection heads that translate target model's activations into source model's latent space, apply frozen LoRA kernel, and project back - trained on general text corpus without task-specific data.

Result: CAST achieves 85-95% performance of fully retrained LoRA on target models, outperforming current weight-space transfer techniques in transfers between heterogeneous model families like Llama-2 and Mistral.

Conclusion: CAST establishes a new state-of-the-art in model interoperability by enabling true zero-shot translation of LoRA adapters through direct activation space mapping.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Model (LLM) architectures presents a
fundamental challenge: valuable, task-specific behaviors learned through
fine-tuning methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) are effectively trapped
within their source model's architecture, herein referred to architectural
lock-in. Existing transfer methods attempt to bridge this gap by aligning the
static weight spaces of models, a brittle and indirect approach that relies on
tenuous correlations between parameter geometries. This paper introduces a
fundamentally different and more direct paradigm: the Cartridge Activation
Space Transfer (CAST), a novel framework that liberates LoRA-encoded behaviors
by learning a direct, nonlinear mapping between the activation manifolds, the
geometric structures formed by the model's internal neuron activations, of two
distinct LLM architectures. CAST treats a pre-trained LoRA as a frozen
"behavioral kernel." It learns a set of lightweight, bidirectional projection
heads that translate the target model's activation stream into the source
model's latent space, apply the frozen kernel, and project the result back.
This process, trained on a general text corpus without any task-specific data,
effectively decouples the learned skill from the source architecture. We
demonstrate that CAST enables true "zero-shot" translation of any standard LoRA
adapter. Our experiments, including transfers between heterogeneous model
families like Llama-2 and Mistral, show that CAST-translated adapters achieve
85-95\% of the performance of a LoRA fully retrained on the target model,
quantitatively outperforming current weight-space transfer techniques and
establishing a new state-of-the-art in model interoperability.

Motivation: Real deployments of task-oriented chatbots face tight token budgets and noisy contexts, and current retrieval pipelines overlook set-level diversity and confounds like context length or exemplar order.

Method: Proposed a diversity-aware retrieval framework that selects in-context exemplars to balance intent coverage and linguistic variety, integrated with standard LLM decoders. Evaluation enforced budget-matched prompts and randomized positions.

Result: Achieved strong gains in Joint Goal Accuracy on MultiWOZ 2.4 and SGD datasets under equal token budgets, surpassing strong LLM/DST baselines. Consistent improvements across K from 4 to 7 with moderate latency.

Conclusion: The study validates the impact of content diversity in retrieval and offers a simple, deployable selection principle for building accurate, budget-constrained multi-turn intent systems.

Abstract: Multi turn intent understanding is central to task oriented chatbots, yet
real deployments face tight token budgets and noisy contexts, and most
retrieval pipelines emphasize relevance while overlooking set level diversity
and confounds such as more context or exemplar order. We ask whether retrieval
diversity, rather than longer prompts, systematically improves LLM intent
understanding under fixed budgets. We present a diversity aware retrieval
framework that selects in context exemplars to balance intent coverage and
linguistic variety, and integrates this selection with standard LLM decoders;
the evaluation enforces budget matched prompts and randomized positions, and
includes sensitivity analyses over exemplar count, diversity strength, and
backbone size. On MultiWOZ 2.4 and SGD, the approach achieves strong gains in
Joint Goal Accuracy under equal token budgets, surpassing strong LLM/DST
baselines, with consistent improvements across K from 4 to 7 and moderate
latency. Overall, the study isolates and validates the impact of content
diversity in retrieval and offers a simple, deployable selection principle for
building accurate, budget constrained multi turn intent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting agentic data (structured interaction records with tool specifications and execution traces) from human annotators is costly, time-consuming, and difficult to scale.

Method: Uses LLMs with modular pipelines to generate complete interaction records including task specifications, tool definitions, policy pseudocode, natural language exchanges, and execution traces. Incorporates constrained generation formats, JSON-schema validation, and judge-based filtering for quality control.

Result: Enables generation of high-quality synthetic agentic data that conforms to strict syntactic and semantic constraints, supporting both multi-task and multi-turn agent interactions.

Conclusion: Provides a reproducible, LLM-only alternative to manual data collection, advancing the development of agentic LLMs capable of robust tool use.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents, expected to
decompose goals, invoke tools, and verify results in dynamic environments.
Realizing these capabilities requires access to agentic data- structured
interaction records that couple user intents with tool specifications,
argument-grounded calls, and verifiable execution traces. However, collecting
such data from human annotators is costly, time-consuming, and difficult to
scale.
  We present a unified framework for synthesizing agentic data using only LLMs,
without any human-in-the-loop supervision. This framework decomposes generation
into modular pipelines that produce complete interaction records spanning task
specifications, tool definitions, policy pseudocode, natural language
exchanges, and execution traces. Records conform to strict syntactic and
semantic constraints, ensuring machine-parseability and faithful alignment
across inputs, outputs, and tool calls.
  Beyond single tasks, there is support for both multi-task and multi-turn
agent interactions, enabling the construction of datasets that reflect the full
spectrum of tool-use competencies. To ensure quality and consistency, the
framework integrates constrained generation formats, JSON-schema validation,
and judge-based filtering.
  This paper formalizes the schema for agentic records, details the prompt
design principles that guide generation, and introduces scalable pipelines for
high-quality synthetic data. By providing a reproducible, LLM-only alternative
to manual collection, hence advancing the development of agentic LLMs capable
of robust tool use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent systems use predefined structures or simple voting/debates that suppress minority opinions, and current graph-based approaches focus only on agent performance while neglecting interaction quality.

Method: Proposes a verbal reinforcement learning algorithm with defined action spaces and feedback mechanisms that evaluate communication robustness and coherence during debates, using majority voting for final decisions.

Result: Significantly outperforms single-agent prompting and state-of-the-art multi-agent frameworks across mathematical reasoning, creative writing, scientific reasoning, and numerical sorting tasks.

Conclusion: Effective agent communication and debating quality are crucial for multi-agent reasoning, and the proposed dynamic collaboration structure optimization method successfully enhances collective reasoning performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities in
mathematical and scientific tasks. To enhance complex reasoning, multi-agent
systems have been proposed to harness the collective intelligence of LLM
agents. However, existing collaboration structures are either predefined or
rely on majority voting or round-table debates, which can suppress correct but
less dominant agent contributions. Recent approaches model multi-agent systems
as graph networks but optimize purely for agent performance, neglecting the
quality of interactions. We hypothesize that effective agent communication is
crucial for multi-agent reasoning and that debating quality plays a significant
role. To address this, we propose $\ours$, a multi-agent verbal reinforcement
learning algorithm that dynamically constructs and refines multi-agent
collaboration structures. Our method defines action spaces and a feedback
mechanism that evaluates communication robustness and coherence throughout the
debate. The final decision is achieved through a majority vote over all the
agents. We assess $\ours$ on various reasoning tasks, including mathematical
reasoning, creative writing, scientific reasoning, and numerical sorting.
Results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms single-agent
prompting methods and state-of-the-art multi-agent frameworks on diverse tasks.

TL;DR: A formalization of a subject-event ontology for modeling complex dynamic systems without global time, using events as acts of fixation, causal ordering via happens-before relationships, and executable declarative dataflow mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model complex dynamic systems without reliance on global time, addressing distributed systems, microservice architectures, DLT platforms, and multiperspectivity scenarios with conflicting facts from different subjects.

Method: Proposes nine axioms (A1-A9) for a subject-event ontology with key principles: events as acts of fixation, causal order via happens-before, executable declarative dataflow, models as epistemic filters, and presumption of truth. Includes three invariants: monotonicity of history (I1), acyclicity of causality (I2), and traceability (I3).

Result: The formalization ensures correctness of executable ontologies and is practically implemented in the boldsea system - a workflow engine using BSL (Boldsea Semantic Language), demonstrating applicability to various distributed computing scenarios.

Conclusion: The subject-event ontology provides a formal foundation for modeling complex dynamic systems without global time, with practical implementation showing viability for distributed systems, microservices, DLT platforms, and multiperspectivity scenarios.

Abstract: A formalization of a subject-event ontology is proposed for modeling complex
dynamic systems without reliance on global time. Key principles: (1) event as
an act of fixation - a subject discerns and fixes changes according to models
(conceptual templates) available to them; (2) causal order via happens-before -
the order of events is defined by explicit dependencies, not timestamps; (3)
making the ontology executable via a declarative dataflow mechanism, ensuring
determinism; (4) models as epistemic filters - a subject can only fix what
falls under its known concepts and properties; (5) presumption of truth - the
declarative content of an event is available for computation from the moment of
fixation, without external verification. The formalization includes nine axioms
(A1-A9), ensuring the correctness of executable ontologies: monotonicity of
history (I1), acyclicity of causality (I2), traceability (I3). Special
attention is given to the model-based approach (A9): event validation via
schemas, actor authorization, automatic construction of causal chains (W3)
without global time. Practical applicability is demonstrated on the boldsea
system - a workflow engine for executable ontologies, where the theoretical
constructs are implemented in BSL (Boldsea Semantic Language). The
formalization is applicable to distributed systems, microservice architectures,
DLT platforms, and multiperspectivity scenarios (conflicting facts from
different subjects).

TL;DR: CompactPrompt is an end-to-end pipeline that compresses LLM prompts and data to reduce token usage and inference costs by up to 60% while maintaining output quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs incur substantial run-time costs in agentic workflows with lengthy prompts and rich data streams, creating a need for cost-effective solutions.

Method: Combines hard prompt compression (pruning low-information tokens using self-information scoring and dependency-based phrase grouping) with lightweight file-level data compression (n-gram abbreviation for textual patterns and uniform quantization for numerical columns).

Result: Reduces total token usage and inference cost by up to 60% on benchmark datasets like TAT-QA and FinQA, with minimal accuracy drop (less than 5% for Claude-3.5-Sonnet and GPT-4.1-Mini).

Conclusion: CompactPrompt enables leaner generative AI pipelines by providing real-time compression visualization and cost-performance trade-off quantification while preserving semantic faithfulness.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver powerful reasoning and generation
capabilities but incur substantial run-time costs when operating in agentic
workflows that chain together lengthy prompts and process rich data streams. We
introduce CompactPrompt, an end-to-end pipeline that merges hard prompt
compression with lightweight file-level data compression. CompactPrompt first
prunes low-information tokens from prompts using self-information scoring and
dependency-based phrase grouping. In parallel, it applies n-gram abbreviation
to recurrent textual patterns in attached documents and uniform quantization to
numerical columns, yielding compact yet semantically faithful representations.
Integrated into standard LLM agents, CompactPrompt reduces total token usage
and inference cost by up to 60% on benchmark dataset like TAT-QA and FinQA,
while preserving output quality (Results in less than 5% accuracy drop for
Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and GPT-4.1-Mini) CompactPrompt helps visualize real-time
compression decisions and quantify cost-performance trade-offs, laying the
groundwork for leaner generative AI pipelines.

### [110] [Planned Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18087)
*Daniel Israel,Tian Jin,Ellie Cheng,Guy Van den Broeck,Aditya Grover,Suvinay Subramanian,Michael Carbin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Planned diffusion is a hybrid method that combines autoregressive planning with parallel diffusion generation to achieve better speed-quality trade-offs in text generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between generation speed and output quality in large language model inference, where autoregressive models are slow but high-quality while diffusion models are fast but need many iterations.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Create short autoregressive plan to break output into independent spans, 2) Generate spans simultaneously using diffusion.

Result: Achieves Pareto-optimal trade-off on AlpacaEval with 1.27x-1.81x speedup over autoregressive generation with only 0.87%-5.4% drop in win rate.

Conclusion: Planned diffusion expands the speed-quality Pareto frontier and provides practical path to faster, high-quality text generation with flexible quality-latency control.

Abstract: A central challenge in large language model inference is the trade-off
between generation speed and output quality. Autoregressive models produce
high-quality text but generate tokens sequentially. Diffusion models can
generate tokens in parallel but often need many iterations to match the same
quality. We propose planned diffusion, a hybrid method that combines the
strengths of both paradigms. Planned diffusion works in two stages: first, the
model creates a short autoregressive plan that breaks the output into smaller,
independent spans. Second, the model generates these spans simultaneously using
diffusion. This approach expands the speed-quality Pareto frontier and provides
a practical path to faster, high-quality text generation. On AlpacaEval, a
suite of 805 instruction-following prompts, planned diffusion achieves
Pareto-optimal trade-off between quality and latency, achieving 1.27x to 1.81x
speedup over autoregressive generation with only 0.87\% to 5.4\% drop in win
rate, respectively. Our sensitivity analysis shows that the planning mechanism
of planned diffusion is minimal and reliable, and simple runtime knobs exist to
provide flexible control of the quality-latency trade-off.

*Nikhil Verma,Manasa Bharadwaj,Wonjun Jang,Harmanpreet Singh,Yixiao Wang,Homa Fashandi,Chul Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SMaRT framework integrates multiple reasoning strategies in LLMs to create balanced solutions, outperforming single-strategy approaches across reasoning, planning, and decision-making tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM methods rely on single-strategy prompting, missing the synergy of diverse reasoning approaches. No single strategy works universally, requiring frameworks that fuse strategies for maximum performance and robustness.

Method: Select, Mix, and ReinvenT (SMaRT) framework uses LLMs as intelligent integrators to seamlessly combine diverse reasoning strategies, rather than just as evaluators.

Result: SMaRT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in solution quality, constraint adherence, and performance metrics across reasoning, planning, and sequential decision-making benchmarks.

Conclusion: SMaRT redefines LLM-driven decision-making by pioneering cross-strategy calibration, unlocking superior outcomes and advancing self-refining methodologies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have redefined complex task automation with
exceptional generalization capabilities. Despite these advancements,
state-of-the-art methods rely on single-strategy prompting, missing the synergy
of diverse reasoning approaches. No single strategy excels universally,
highlighting the need for frameworks that fuse strategies to maximize
performance and ensure robustness. We introduce the Select, Mix, and ReinvenT
(SMaRT) framework, an innovative strategy fusion approach designed to overcome
this constraint by creating balanced and efficient solutions through the
seamless integration of diverse reasoning strategies. Unlike existing methods,
which employ LLMs merely as evaluators, SMaRT uses them as intelligent
integrators, unlocking the "best of all worlds" across tasks. Extensive
empirical evaluations across benchmarks in reasoning, planning, and sequential
decision-making highlight the robustness and adaptability of SMaRT. The
framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in solution
quality, constraint adherence, and performance metrics. This work redefines
LLM-driven decision-making by pioneering a new paradigm in cross-strategy
calibration, unlocking superior outcomes for reasoning systems and advancing
the boundaries of self-refining methodologies.

### [112] [Measuring Reasoning in LLMs: a New Dialectical Angle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18134)
*Soheil Abbasloo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SIEV, a dialectics-based framework that evaluates LLM reasoning as a dynamic process rather than just final answers, revealing significant reasoning gaps in state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations focus only on correct answers without revealing the reasoning process. The authors argue that reasoning should be viewed as a dynamic trajectory where ideas interact and evolve, not just a static chain of steps.

Method: The authors propose SIEV (Structured Interactive Evaluation of Veridicality), a framework based on dialectics (thesis, antithesis, synthesis) that assesses how models resolve tension, integrate ideas, and synthesize higher-order reasoning.

Result: SIEV uncovers significant reasoning gaps in state-of-the-art models. GPT-5-chat loses over 40 points (out of 100) when evaluated with SIEV on GSM benchmarks, even under saturated benchmarks like GSM and MMLU.

Conclusion: A process-oriented, philosophically grounded approach enables deeper, more rigorous, and more discriminative assessment of LLM reasoning, revealing limitations that conventional evaluations miss.

Abstract: What does it truly mean for a language model to "reason"? Most current
evaluations and benchmarks reward models' correct standalone answers--but
correctness alone reveals little about the process that produced them. In this
work, we explore a different perspective: reasoning is not a static chain of
steps, but a dynamic trajectory where ideas interact, clash, and evolve into
deeper insights. To capture this dynamic, we draw on a well-established
philosophical tradition: \textit{dialectics}, where reasoning unfolds through
thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. Building on this, we present SIEV, a
structured framework that evaluates reasoning of LLMs through dialectics.
Unlike conventional evaluations, SIEV assesses not only the conclusion a model
reaches, but how it gets there: its ability to resolve tension, integrate
distinct ideas, and synthesize higher-order reasoning. This lens uncovers
significant reasoning gaps in state-of-the-art models even under saturated
benchmarks like GSM and MMLU. For instance, GPT-5-chat, a recent model, loses
over 40 points (out of 100) when evaluated with SIEV on GSM. Our findings
highlight that adopting a process-oriented, philosophically grounded approach
enables a deeper, more rigorous, and more discriminative assessment of LLM
reasoning.

TL;DR: PaDA-Agent is an evaluation-driven approach that streamlines data augmentation for Small Language Models by discovering failure patterns and drafting targeted strategies to reduce generalization gaps, achieving significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small Language Models (SLMs) have deployment advantages but lag in accuracy for complex tasks. Supervised fine-tuning requires substantial manual effort in data preparation and optimization, creating a need for more efficient approaches.

Method: PaDA-Agent discovers failure patterns from validation data via evaluations and drafts targeted data augmentation strategies to directly reduce generalization gaps, using coordinated operations rather than focusing only on model training errors.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art LLM-based data augmentation approaches for fine-tuning the Llama 3.2 1B Instruct model.

Conclusion: The PaDA-Agent approach effectively streamlines data augmentation for SLMs by targeting failure patterns, offering a more efficient alternative to traditional supervised fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) offer compelling advantages in deployment cost
and latency, but their accuracy often lags behind larger models, particularly
for complex domain-specific tasks. While supervised fine-tuning can help bridge
this performance gap, it requires substantial manual effort in data preparation
and iterative optimization. We present PaDA-Agent (Pattern-guided Data
Augmentation Agent), an evaluation-driven approach that streamlines the data
augmentation process for SLMs through coordinated operations. Unlike
state-of-the-art approaches that focus on model training errors only and
generating error-correcting samples, PaDA-Agent discovers failure patterns from
the validation data via evaluations and drafts targeted data augmentation
strategies aiming to directly reduce the generalization gap. Our experimental
results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art LLM-based
data augmentation approaches for Llama 3.2 1B Instruct model fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A sentence-level labeled dataset for activation-based monitoring of safety behaviors during LLM reasoning, enabling detection and steering of safety concerns in model activations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current textual reasoning analysis can miss subtle harmful patterns and be circumvented by models hiding unsafe reasoning, highlighting the need for activation-level safety monitoring.

Method: Created a dataset with sentence-level annotations of safety behaviors (safety concerns, user intent speculation) and extracted steering vectors from model activations to detect and influence these behaviors.

Result: Demonstrated utility by extracting representations that successfully detect and steer safety behaviors in model activations, showing potential for improved safety oversight.

Conclusion: Activation-level techniques using sentence-level behavioral annotations offer promising approach for enhancing safety monitoring during chain-of-thought reasoning.

Abstract: Recent work has highlighted the importance of monitoring chain-of-thought
reasoning for AI safety; however, current approaches that analyze textual
reasoning steps can miss subtle harmful patterns and may be circumvented by
models that hide unsafe reasoning. We present a sentence-level labeled dataset
that enables activation-based monitoring of safety behaviors during LLM
reasoning. Our dataset contains reasoning sequences with sentence-level
annotations of safety behaviors such as expression of safety concerns or
speculation on user intent, which we use to extract steering vectors for
detecting and influencing these behaviors within model activations. The dataset
fills a key gap in safety research: while existing datasets label reasoning
holistically, effective application of steering vectors for safety monitoring
could be improved by identifying precisely when specific behaviors occur within
reasoning chains. We demonstrate the dataset's utility by extracting
representations that both detect and steer safety behaviors in model
activations, showcasing the potential of activation-level techniques for
improving safety oversight on reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-powered multi-agent simulation framework for consumer decision-making that models social dynamics and purchasing decisions without predefined rules, enabling strategy testing and revealing emergent patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like post-event analyses and rule-based ABMs fail to capture the complexity of human behavior and social interactions in marketing scenarios.

Method: Multi-agent simulation framework powered by large language models, where generative agents interact, reason internally, form habits, and make purchasing decisions in a sandbox environment without predefined rules.

Result: In price-discount marketing scenarios, the system produces actionable strategy-testing outcomes and reveals emergent social patterns that conventional methods cannot capture.

Conclusion: This approach provides marketers with a scalable, low-risk tool for pre-implementation testing, reducing reliance on time-intensive post-event evaluations and lowering campaign failure risks.

Abstract: Simulating consumer decision-making is vital for designing and evaluating
marketing strategies before costly real- world deployment. However, post-event
analyses and rule-based agent-based models (ABMs) struggle to capture the
complexity of human behavior and social interaction. We introduce an
LLM-powered multi-agent simulation framework that models consumer decisions and
social dynamics. Building on recent advances in large language model simulation
in a sandbox envi- ronment, our framework enables generative agents to
interact, express internal reasoning, form habits, and make purchasing
decisions without predefined rules. In a price-discount marketing scenario, the
system delivers actionable strategy-testing outcomes and reveals emergent
social patterns beyond the reach of con- ventional methods. This approach
offers marketers a scalable, low-risk tool for pre-implementation testing,
reducing reliance on time-intensive post-event evaluations and lowering the
risk of underperforming campaigns.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Saber is a training-free sampling algorithm for diffusion language models that improves code generation by adaptively accelerating inference speed while maintaining output quality through backtracking mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion language models have advantages in parallel generation but suffer from a critical trade-off between inference speed and output quality in code generation tasks, where reducing sampling steps causes performance collapse.

Method: Saber uses adaptive acceleration based on established code context and incorporates backtracking mechanisms to reverse generated tokens when needed, without requiring additional training.

Result: Saber achieves average 1.9% improvement in Pass@1 accuracy and 251.4% inference speedup compared to mainstream DLM sampling methods on multiple code generation benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed Saber algorithm significantly narrows the performance gap between diffusion language models and autoregressive models in code generation by leveraging DLMs' inherent advantages while overcoming their speed-quality trade-off.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) are emerging as a powerful and promising
alternative to the dominant autoregressive paradigm, offering inherent
advantages in parallel generation and bidirectional context modeling. However,
the performance of DLMs on code generation tasks, which have stronger
structural constraints, is significantly hampered by the critical trade-off
between inference speed and output quality. We observed that accelerating the
code generation process by reducing the number of sampling steps usually leads
to a catastrophic collapse in performance. In this paper, we introduce
efficient Sampling with Adaptive acceleration and Backtracking Enhanced
Remasking (i.e., Saber), a novel training-free sampling algorithm for DLMs to
achieve better inference speed and output quality in code generation.
Specifically, Saber is motivated by two key insights in the DLM generation
process: 1) it can be adaptively accelerated as more of the code context is
established; 2) it requires a backtracking mechanism to reverse the generated
tokens. Extensive experiments on multiple mainstream code generation benchmarks
show that Saber boosts Pass@1 accuracy by an average improvement of 1.9% over
mainstream DLM sampling methods, meanwhile achieving an average 251.4%
inference speedup. By leveraging the inherent advantages of DLMs, our work
significantly narrows the performance gap with autoregressive models in code
generation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentChangeBench is a benchmark for evaluating how tool-augmented language model agents adapt to mid-dialogue goal changes across enterprise domains, using four metrics to measure effectiveness, reliability, efficiency, and adaptation latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agent benchmarks primarily evaluate static objectives or one-shot tool use, but real-world multi-turn interactions often involve goal changes, creating a gap in evaluating agent adaptability.

Method: The benchmark comprises 2,835 task sequences and five user personas designed to trigger realistic shift points in workflows, with evaluation through four metrics: Task Success Rate, Tool Use Efficiency, Tool Call Redundancy Rate, and Goal-Shift Recovery Time.

Result: Evaluation of frontier models revealed sharp contrasts: GPT-4o reached 92.2% recovery on airline booking shifts while Gemini collapsed to 48.6%, and retail tasks showed near perfect parameter validity but redundancy rates above 80%, indicating major inefficiencies.

Conclusion: High raw accuracy does not imply robustness under dynamic goals, and explicit measurement of recovery time and redundancy is essential for evaluating agent resilience in realistic enterprise settings.

Abstract: Goal changes are a defining feature of real world multi-turn interactions,
yet current agent benchmarks primarily evaluate static objectives or one-shot
tool use. We introduce AgentChangeBench, a benchmark explicitly designed to
measure how tool augmented language model agents adapt to mid dialogue goal
shifts across three enterprise domains. Our framework formalizes evaluation
through four complementary metrics: Task Success Rate (TSR) for effectiveness,
Tool Use Efficiency (TUE) for reliability, Tool Call Redundancy Rate (TCRR) for
wasted effort, and Goal-Shift Recovery Time (GSRT) for adaptation latency.
AgentChangeBench comprises 2,835 task sequences and five user personas, each
designed to trigger realistic shift points in ongoing workflows. Using this
setup, we evaluate several frontier models and uncover sharp contrasts obscured
by traditional $\text{pass}@k$ scores: for example, GPT-4o reaches $92.2\%$
recovery on airline booking shifts while Gemini collapses to $48.6\%$, and
retail tasks show near perfect parameter validity yet redundancy rates above
$80\%$, revealing major inefficiencies. These findings demonstrate that high
raw accuracy does not imply robustness under dynamic goals, and that explicit
measurement of recovery time and redundancy is essential. AgentChangeBench
establishes a reproducible testbed for diagnosing and improving agent
resilience in realistic enterprise settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLVR-based post-training of LLMs improves trace coherence but not necessarily final answer correctness, highlighting a distinction between local reasoning consistency and solution validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods treat all tokens uniformly and claim improved reasoning traces based on final answer metrics, but don't examine intermediate tokens that aren't directly incentivized.

Method: Used GRPO algorithm with Qwen-2.5-0.5B model on GSM8K dataset, introduced trace coherence measure based on First-Order Logic to capture reasoning step consistency by identifying errors.

Result: RL post-training improves trace coherence significantly on problems where base model fails but RL model succeeds, but enhances local coherence without necessarily producing valid or correct solutions.

Conclusion: Claims of improved reasoning via RL must be examined carefully as improved trace coherence doesn't guarantee valid mathematical proofs or final answer correctness.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)-based post-training of
Large Language Models (LLMs) has been shown to improve accuracy on reasoning
tasks and continues to attract significant attention. Existing RLVR methods,
however, typically treat all tokens uniformly without accounting for
token-level advantages. These methods primarily evaluate performance based on
final answer correctness or Pass@K accuracy, and yet make claims about RL
post-training leading to improved reasoning traces. This motivates our
investigation into the effect of RL post-training on intermediate tokens which
are not directly incentivized. To study this, we design an experimental setup
using the GRPO algorithm with Qwen-2.5-0.5B model on the GSM8K dataset. We
introduce trace coherence, a First-Order Logic (FOL)-based measure to capture
the consistency of reasoning steps by identifying errors in the traces. We
distinguish between trace validity and trace coherence, noting that the former
implies logical soundness while the latter measures local coherence via lack of
errors. Our results show that RL post-training overall improves trace coherence
with the most significant gains on problems where the base model fails but the
RL model succeeds. Surprisingly, RL enhances local coherence without
necessarily producing valid or correct solutions. This highlights a crucial
distinction: improved local coherence in reasoning steps does not guarantee
final answer correctness. We argue that claims of improved reasoning via RL
must be examined with care, as these may be based on improved trace coherence,
which may not translate into fully valid mathematical proofs.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a quantifiable framework for measuring Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) based on human cognitive abilities, revealing that current AI systems like GPT-4 (27%) and GPT-5 (58%) still have significant gaps in foundational cognitive domains despite rapid progress.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a concrete definition for AGI obscures the gap between today's specialized AI and human-level cognition, necessitating a quantifiable framework to measure progress toward true general intelligence.

Method: The framework grounds methodology in Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory, dissecting general intelligence into ten core cognitive domains and adapting established human psychometric batteries to evaluate AI systems.

Result: Application reveals a "jagged" cognitive profile in contemporary models - proficient in knowledge-intensive domains but with critical deficits in foundational cognitive machinery, particularly long-term memory storage. AGI scores show GPT-4 at 27% and GPT-5 at 58%.

Conclusion: The framework concretely quantifies both rapid AI progress and the substantial gap remaining before achieving AGI, highlighting specific cognitive deficiencies that need to be addressed.

Abstract: The lack of a concrete definition for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
obscures the gap between today's specialized AI and human-level cognition. This
paper introduces a quantifiable framework to address this, defining AGI as
matching the cognitive versatility and proficiency of a well-educated adult. To
operationalize this, we ground our methodology in Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory,
the most empirically validated model of human cognition. The framework dissects
general intelligence into ten core cognitive domains-including reasoning,
memory, and perception-and adapts established human psychometric batteries to
evaluate AI systems. Application of this framework reveals a highly "jagged"
cognitive profile in contemporary models. While proficient in
knowledge-intensive domains, current AI systems have critical deficits in
foundational cognitive machinery, particularly long-term memory storage. The
resulting AGI scores (e.g., GPT-4 at 27%, GPT-5 at 58%) concretely quantify
both rapid progress and the substantial gap remaining before AGI.

*Xiaohan Qin,Xiaoxing Wang,Ning Liao,Cancheng Zhang,Xiangdong Zhang,Mingquan Feng,Jingzhi Wang,Junchi Yan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ssToken is a token-level data selection method for LLM fine-tuning that uses self-modulated loss differences and semantic-aware attention metrics to select important tokens without needing additional reference models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing token-level selection methods require training additional reference models and rely solely on loss information, which fails to preserve semantically important tokens not captured by loss metrics.

Method: Uses history models to compute per-token loss differences as self-modulated signals, and introduces attention-based semantic importance metrics orthogonal to loss-based selection.

Result: Both self-modulated and semantic-aware selection alone outperform full-data fine-tuning, and their integration achieves synergistic gains surpassing prior token-level selection methods.

Conclusion: ssToken delivers performance improvements while maintaining training efficiency across different model families and scales.

Abstract: Data quality plays a critical role in enhancing supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
for large language models (LLMs), and token-level data selection has emerged as
a promising direction for its fine-grained nature. Despite their strong
empirical performance, existing token-level selection methods share two key
limitations: (1) requiring training or accessing an additional reference model,
and (2) relying solely on loss information for token selection, which cannot
well preserve semantically important tokens that are not favored by loss-based
metrics. To address these challenges, we propose ssToken, a Self-modulated and
Semantic-aware Token Selection approach. ssToken leverages readily accessible
history models to compute the per-token loss difference with the current model,
which serves as a self-modulated signal that enables the model to adaptively
select tokens along its optimization trajectory, rather than relying on excess
loss from an offline-trained reference model as in prior works. We further
introduce a semantic-aware, attention-based token importance estimation metric,
orthogonal to loss-based selection and providing complementary semantic
information for more effective filtering. Extensive experiments across
different model families and scales demonstrate that both self-modulated
selection and semantic-aware selection alone outperform full-data fine-tuning,
while their integration--ssToken--achieves synergistic gains and further
surpasses prior token-level selection methods, delivering performance
improvements while maintaining training efficiency.

### [122] [Illusions of reflection: open-ended task reveals systematic failures in Large Language Models' reflective reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18254)
*Sion Weatherhead,Flora Salim,Aaron Belbasis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Current LLM 'reflection' is functionally different from human reflective reasoning - it shows limited self-correction ability on open-ended tasks and often repeats the same constraint violations rather than detecting and fixing errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether LLM 'reflection' is functionally equivalent to human reflective reasoning, especially on open-ended tasks where clear external correctness signals are absent.

Method: Tested eight frontier models on producing valid scientific test items and revising after self-critique, measuring performance before and after reflection on this open-ended yet rule-constrained task.

Result: First-pass performance was poor (mean ≈1 valid item out of 4), reflection yielded only modest gains (also ≈1), and models frequently repeated the same constraint violations in second attempts, showing corrective gains came from chance rather than principled error detection and repair.

Conclusion: Current LLM reflection lacks the active, goal-driven monitoring that helps humans respect constraints, and reliable performance requires external constraint-enforcing structure rather than relying on model self-correction.

Abstract: Humans do not just find mistakes after the fact -- we often catch them
mid-stream because 'reflection' is tied to the goal and its constraints.
Today's large language models produce reasoning tokens and 'reflective' text,
but is it functionally equivalent with human reflective reasoning? Prior work
on closed-ended tasks -- with clear, external 'correctness' signals -- can make
'reflection' look effective while masking limits in self-correction. We
therefore test eight frontier models on a simple, real-world task that is
open-ended yet rule-constrained, with auditable success criteria: to produce
valid scientific test items, then revise after considering their own critique.
First-pass performance is poor (often zero valid items out of 4 required; mean
$\approx$ 1), and reflection yields only modest gains (also $\approx$ 1).
Crucially, the second attempt frequently repeats the same violation of
constraint, indicating 'corrective gains' arise largely from chance production
of a valid item rather than error detection and principled,
constraint-sensitive repair. Performance before and after reflection
deteriorates as open-endedness increases, and models marketed for 'reasoning'
show no advantage. Our results suggest that current LLM 'reflection' lacks
functional evidence of the active, goal-driven monitoring that helps humans
respect constraints even on a first pass. Until such mechanisms are
instantiated in the model itself, reliable performance requires external
structure that enforces constraints.

### [123] [Genesis: Evolving Attack Strategies for LLM Web Agent Red-Teaming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18314)
*Zheng Zhang,Jiarui He,Yuchen Cai,Deheng Ye,Peilin Zhao,Ruili Feng,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Genesis is an agentic framework for attacking web agents that combines genetic algorithms with dynamic strategy discovery to outperform existing attack methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing web agent attack methods rely on manual strategies or static models that fail to capture behavioral patterns and generalize across diverse environments, while successful attacks require continuous discovery and evolution of strategies.

Method: Genesis framework with three modules: Attacker (generates adversarial injections using genetic algorithm with hybrid strategy representation), Scorer (evaluates target agent responses), and Strategist (discovers effective strategies from interaction logs and builds a growing strategy library).

Result: Extensive experiments across various web tasks show the framework discovers novel strategies and consistently outperforms existing attack baselines.

Conclusion: The Genesis framework successfully addresses the limitations of existing web agent attack methods by enabling continuous strategy discovery and evolution through its modular design.

Abstract: As large language model (LLM) agents increasingly automate complex web tasks,
they boost productivity while simultaneously introducing new security risks.
However, relevant studies on web agent attacks remain limited. Existing
red-teaming approaches mainly rely on manually crafted attack strategies or
static models trained offline. Such methods fail to capture the underlying
behavioral patterns of web agents, making it difficult to generalize across
diverse environments. In web agent attacks, success requires the continuous
discovery and evolution of attack strategies. To this end, we propose Genesis,
a novel agentic framework composed of three modules: Attacker, Scorer, and
Strategist. The Attacker generates adversarial injections by integrating the
genetic algorithm with a hybrid strategy representation. The Scorer evaluates
the target web agent's responses to provide feedback. The Strategist
dynamically uncovers effective strategies from interaction logs and compiles
them into a continuously growing strategy library, which is then re-deployed to
enhance the Attacker's effectiveness. Extensive experiments across various web
tasks show that our framework discovers novel strategies and consistently
outperforms existing attack baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ShortcutBreaker is a unified feature-reconstruction framework for multi-class unsupervised anomaly detection that addresses identity shortcuts in Transformer architectures through a low-rank noisy bottleneck and global perturbation attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Transformer-based MUAD methods suffer from identity shortcuts that copy inputs to outputs, narrowing the reconstruction error gap between normal and abnormal cases, making them harder to distinguish.

Method: Proposes ShortcutBreaker with two key innovations: 1) Low-rank noisy bottleneck (LRNB) that projects features into low-rank latent space to prevent trivial identity reproduction, and 2) Global perturbation attention leveraging ViT's global modeling to prevent information shortcuts in decoders.

Result: Achieved image-level AUROC of 99.8% on MVTec-AD, 98.9% on ViSA, 90.6% on Real-IAD, and 87.8% on Universal Medical dataset, consistently outperforming previous MUAD methods across different scenarios.

Conclusion: ShortcutBreaker effectively addresses identity shortcut issues in MUAD tasks and demonstrates superior performance across industrial and medical datasets, providing a unified solution for multi-class anomaly detection.

Abstract: Multi-class unsupervised anomaly detection (MUAD) has garnered growing
research interest, as it seeks to develop a unified model for anomaly detection
across multiple classes, i.e., eliminating the need to train separate models
for distinct objects and thereby saving substantial computational resources.
Under the MUAD setting, while advanced Transformer-based architectures have
brought significant performance improvements, identity shortcuts persist: they
directly copy inputs to outputs, narrowing the gap in reconstruction errors
between normal and abnormal cases, and thereby making the two harder to
distinguish. Therefore, we propose ShortcutBreaker, a novel unified
feature-reconstruction framework for MUAD tasks, featuring two key innovations
to address the issue of shortcuts. First, drawing on matrix rank inequality, we
design a low-rank noisy bottleneck (LRNB) to project highdimensional features
into a low-rank latent space, and theoretically demonstrate its capacity to
prevent trivial identity reproduction. Second, leveraging ViTs global modeling
capability instead of merely focusing on local features, we incorporate a
global perturbation attention to prevent information shortcuts in the decoders.
Extensive experiments are performed on four widely used anomaly detection
benchmarks, including three industrial datasets (MVTec-AD, ViSA, and Real-IAD)
and one medical dataset (Universal Medical). The proposed method achieves a
remarkable image-level AUROC of 99.8%, 98.9%, 90.6%, and 87.8% on these four
datasets, respectively, consistently outperforming previous MUAD methods across
different scenarios.

Conclusion: MASMP establishes a new paradigm for combining neural and symbolic AI in complex decision-making, achieving both interpretability and FSM-like reliability while retaining LLMs' semantic comprehension.

Abstract: This paper proposes Memory-Augmented State Machine Prompting (MASMP), a novel
framework for LLM agents in real-time strategy games. Addressing key challenges
like hallucinations and fragmented decision-making in existing approaches,
MASMP integrates state machine prompting with memory mechanisms to unify
structured actions with long-term tactical coherence. The framework features:
(1) a natural language-driven state machine architecture that guides LLMs to
emulate finite state machines and behavior trees through prompts, and (2) a
lightweight memory module preserving strategic variables (e.g., tactics,
priority units) across decision cycles. Experiments in StarCraft II demonstrate
MASMP's 60% win rate against the hardest built-in AI (Lv7), vastly
outperforming baselines (0%). Case studies reveal the method retains LLMs'
semantic comprehension while resolving the "Knowing-Doing Gap" through strict

*Manjie Xu,Xinyi Yang,Jiayu Zhan,Wei Liang,Chi Zhang,Yixin Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Heterogeneous Adversarial Play (HAP) is an adversarial Automatic Curriculum Learning framework that enables teacher-student co-evolution through minimax optimization, overcoming limitations of symmetric self-play in asymmetric learning scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional self-play frameworks relying on agent symmetry are inadequate for open-ended learning with inherent asymmetry, while human pedagogical systems demonstrate effective asymmetric instruction that needs to be operationalized in artificial systems.

Method: HAP formalizes teacher-student interactions as minimax optimization where task-generating instructors and problem-solving learners co-evolve through adversarial dynamics with bidirectional feedback, continuously recalibrating task complexity based on learner performance.

Result: Experimental validation shows HAP achieves performance parity with state-of-the-art baselines while generating curricula that enhance learning efficacy in both artificial agents and human subjects across multi-task learning domains.

Conclusion: The framework successfully operationalizes asymmetric pedagogical mechanisms for autonomous curriculum synthesis without predetermined task hierarchies, enabling more effective open-ended learning.

Abstract: Self-play constitutes a fundamental paradigm for autonomous skill
acquisition, whereby agents iteratively enhance their capabilities through
self-directed environmental exploration. Conventional self-play frameworks
exploit agent symmetry within zero-sum competitive settings, yet this approach
proves inadequate for open-ended learning scenarios characterized by inherent
asymmetry. Human pedagogical systems exemplify asymmetric instructional
frameworks wherein educators systematically construct challenges calibrated to
individual learners' developmental trajectories. The principal challenge
resides in operationalizing these asymmetric, adaptive pedagogical mechanisms
within artificial systems capable of autonomously synthesizing appropriate
curricula without predetermined task hierarchies. Here we present Heterogeneous
Adversarial Play (HAP), an adversarial Automatic Curriculum Learning framework
that formalizes teacher-student interactions as a minimax optimization wherein
task-generating instructor and problem-solving learner co-evolve through
adversarial dynamics. In contrast to prevailing ACL methodologies that employ
static curricula or unidirectional task selection mechanisms, HAP establishes a
bidirectional feedback system wherein instructors continuously recalibrate task
complexity in response to real-time learner performance metrics. Experimental
validation across multi-task learning domains demonstrates that our framework
achieves performance parity with SOTA baselines while generating curricula that
enhance learning efficacy in both artificial agents and human subjects.

Conclusion: The proposed Med-VRAgent framework effectively enhances medical visual reasoning capabilities of VLMs through visual guidance, tree search, and reinforcement learning fine-tuning.

Motivation: Urban waterlogging poses an increasingly severe threat due to climate change, but existing monitoring approaches rely heavily on manual reporting and fail to provide timely and comprehensive assessments.

Result: Evaluations show substantial improvements in perception performance on visual benchmarks, and GPT-based evaluations confirm the ability to generate reliable textual reports describing waterlogging extent, depth, risk and impact.

Conclusion: UWAssess enables a shift from perception to generation in waterlogging monitoring, and the collaborative framework of multiple foundation models lays groundwork for intelligent and scalable systems supporting urban management, disaster response and climate resilience.

Abstract: With climate change intensifying, urban waterlogging poses an increasingly
severe threat to global public safety and infrastructure. However, existing
monitoring approaches rely heavily on manual reporting and fail to provide
timely and comprehensive assessments. In this study, we present Urban
Waterlogging Assessment (UWAssess), a foundation model-driven framework that
automatically identifies waterlogged areas in surveillance images and generates
structured assessment reports. To address the scarcity of labeled data, we
design a semi-supervised fine-tuning strategy and a chain-of-thought (CoT)
prompting strategy to unleash the potential of the foundation model for
data-scarce downstream tasks. Evaluations on challenging visual benchmarks
demonstrate substantial improvements in perception performance. GPT-based
evaluations confirm the ability of UWAssess to generate reliable textual
reports that accurately describe waterlogging extent, depth, risk and impact.
This dual capability enables a shift of waterlogging monitoring from perception

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimization modeling is difficult to automate as informal language must be mapped to precise mathematical formulations and solver code, with prior LLM approaches being either brittle or requiring costly retraining with limited generalization.

Method: AlphaOPT uses a continual two-phase cycle: (1) Library Learning phase that reflects on failed attempts and extracts solver-verified structured insights, and (2) Library Evolution phase that diagnoses retrieval misalignments and refines applicability conditions of stored insights.

Result: AlphaOPT steadily improves with more data (65% to 72% from 100 to 300 training items) and surpasses the strongest baseline by 7.7% on the out-of-distribution OptiBench dataset when trained only on answers.

Conclusion: AlphaOPT enables efficient learning from limited demonstrations without curated rationales, expands continually without costly retraining by updating the library rather than model weights, and makes knowledge explicit and interpretable for human inspection and intervention.

Abstract: Optimization modeling enables critical decisions across industries but
remains difficult to automate: informal language must be mapped to precise
mathematical formulations and executable solver code. Prior LLM approaches
either rely on brittle prompting or costly retraining with limited
generalization. We present AlphaOPT, a self-improving experience library that
enables an LLM to learn from limited demonstrations (even answers alone,
without gold-standard programs) and solver feedback - without annotated
reasoning traces or parameter updates. AlphaOPT operates in a continual
two-phase cycle: (i) a Library Learning phase that reflects on failed attempts,
extracting solver-verified, structured insights as {taxonomy, condition,
explanation, example}; and (ii) a Library Evolution phase that diagnoses
retrieval misalignments and refines the applicability conditions of stored
insights, improving transfer across tasks. This design (1) learns efficiently
from limited demonstrations without curated rationales, (2) expands continually
without costly retraining by updating the library rather than model weights,
and (3) makes knowledge explicit and interpretable for human inspection and
intervention. Experiments show that AlphaOPT steadily improves with more data
(65% to 72% from 100 to 300 training items) and surpasses the strongest

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PlanU addresses LLM uncertainty in decision-making by integrating quantile distributions and curiosity-driven exploration into Monte Carlo Tree Search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with decision-making under uncertainty, particularly in stochastic environments, due to both LLM uncertainty and environmental uncertainty. Existing approaches either ignore environmental uncertainty or are not suitable for multi-step decision-making tasks.

Method: PlanU integrates uncertainty modeling into Monte Carlo Tree Search by representing node returns as quantile distributions and using an Upper Confidence Bounds with Curiosity (UCC) score to balance exploration and exploitation during tree search.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that PlanU is effective for LLM-based decision-making tasks under uncertainty, showing improved performance in stochastic environments.

Conclusion: PlanU successfully addresses uncertainty challenges in LLM decision-making by capturing both LLM and environmental uncertainty within MCTS, enabling more robust planning in stochastic environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being explored across a range
of decision-making tasks. However, LLMs sometimes struggle with decision-making
tasks under uncertainty that are relatively easy for humans, such as planning
actions in stochastic environments. The adoption of LLMs for decision-making is
impeded by uncertainty challenges, such as LLM uncertainty and environmental
uncertainty. LLM uncertainty arises from the stochastic sampling process
inherent to LLMs. Most LLM-based Decision-Making (LDM) approaches address LLM
uncertainty through multiple reasoning chains or search trees. However, these
approaches overlook environmental uncertainty, which leads to poor performance
in environments with stochastic state transitions. Some recent LDM approaches
deal with uncertainty by forecasting the probability of unknown variables.
However, they are not designed for multi-step decision-making tasks that
require interaction with the environment. To address uncertainty in LLM
decision-making, we introduce PlanU, an LLM-based planning method that captures
uncertainty within Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). PlanU models the return of
each node in the MCTS as a quantile distribution, which uses a set of quantiles
to represent the return distribution. To balance exploration and exploitation
during tree search, PlanU introduces an Upper Confidence Bounds with Curiosity
(UCC) score which estimates the uncertainty of MCTS nodes. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PlanU in LLM-based
decision-making tasks under uncertainty.

TL;DR: CircuitSeer is a novel data selection method that identifies reasoning complexity by measuring data's influence on specialized attention head circuits in LLMs, achieving better performance with only 10% of training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data selection methods for LLMs rely on expensive external models or opaque heuristics, while scaling reasoning performance requires massive datasets that are computationally expensive to train on.

Method: Proposes CircuitSeer, which identifies core reasoning circuits (sparse, specialized attention heads) in LLMs and quantifies reasoning complexity by measuring data's influence on these circuits.

Result: Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on just 10% of data selected by CircuitSeer achieves 1.4-point gain in average Pass@1 over training on full dataset. Extensive experiments on 4 models and 9 datasets demonstrate superiority.

Conclusion: CircuitSeer provides an efficient and effective data selection method by leveraging internal model mechanisms rather than external heuristics, enabling better reasoning performance with significantly less training data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities, but scaling their performance often relies on massive reasoning
datasets that are computationally expensive to train on. Existing data
selection methods aim to curate smaller, high-quality subsets but often rely on
costly external models or opaque heuristics. In this work, we shift the focus
from external heuristics to the model's internal mechanisms. We find that
complex reasoning tasks consistently activate a sparse, specialized subset of
attention heads, forming core reasoning circuits. Building on this insight, we
propose CircuitSeer, a novel data selection method that quantifies the
reasoning complexity of data by measuring its influence on these crucial
circuits. Extensive experiments on 4 models and 9 datasets demonstrate
CircuitSeer's superiority. Notably, fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on just 10% of
data selected by our method achieves a 1.4-point gain in average Pass@1 over
training on the full dataset, highlighting its efficiency and effectiveness.

Motivation: To develop socially intelligent LLM agents capable of handling uncertainty in multi-turn social dialogues by modeling partner intentions probabilistically.

Method: Maintains belief distribution over partner's latent intentions, initialized from contextual priors and dynamically updated through likelihood estimation after each utterance.

Result: Increases Overall score by 9.0% on SOTOPIA-All and 4.1% on SOTOPIA-Hard compared to Qwen2.5-7B baseline, and slightly surpasses an oracle agent that directly observes partner intentions.

Conclusion: Probabilistic intent modeling can contribute to the development of socially intelligent LLM agents.

Abstract: We present a probabilistic intent modeling framework for large language model
(LLM) agents in multi-turn social dialogue. The framework maintains a belief
distribution over a partner's latent intentions, initialized from contextual
priors and dynamically updated through likelihood estimation after each
utterance. The evolving distribution provides additional contextual grounding
for the policy, enabling adaptive dialogue strategies under uncertainty.
Preliminary experiments in the SOTOPIA environment show consistent
improvements: the proposed framework increases the Overall score by 9.0% on
SOTOPIA-All and 4.1% on SOTOPIA-Hard compared with the Qwen2.5-7B baseline, and
slightly surpasses an oracle agent that directly observes partner intentions.
These early results suggest that probabilistic intent modeling can contribute

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LAFA is the first system that integrates LLM-agent-based data analytics with federated analytics (FA) to enable privacy-preserving analytics with natural language queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-agent analytics frameworks lack privacy protection by assuming centralized data access, while federated analytics preserves privacy but requires structured queries and lacks natural language support.

Method: LAFA uses a hierarchical multi-agent architecture with a coarse-grained planner that decomposes queries into sub-queries, a fine-grained planner that maps subqueries to FA operation DAGs, and an optimizer agent that rewrites and merges DAGs to eliminate redundancy.

Result: LAFA outperforms baseline prompting strategies with higher execution plan success rates and significantly reduces resource-intensive FA operations.

Conclusion: LAFA establishes a practical foundation for privacy-preserving, LLM-driven analytics that supports natural language input in federated analytics settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise in automating data
analytics tasks by interpreting natural language queries and generating
multi-operation execution plans. However, existing LLM-agent-based analytics
frameworks operate under the assumption of centralized data access, offering
little to no privacy protection. In contrast, federated analytics (FA) enables
privacy-preserving computation across distributed data sources, but lacks
support for natural language input and requires structured, machine-readable
queries. In this work, we present LAFA, the first system that integrates
LLM-agent-based data analytics with FA. LAFA introduces a hierarchical
multi-agent architecture that accepts natural language queries and transforms
them into optimized, executable FA workflows. A coarse-grained planner first
decomposes complex queries into sub-queries, while a fine-grained planner maps
each subquery into a Directed Acyclic Graph of FA operations using prior
structural knowledge. To improve execution efficiency, an optimizer agent
rewrites and merges multiple DAGs, eliminating redundant operations and
minimizing computational and communicational overhead. Our experiments
demonstrate that LAFA consistently outperforms baseline prompting strategies by
achieving higher execution plan success rates and reducing resource-intensive
FA operations by a substantial margin. This work establishes a practical
foundation for privacy-preserving, LLM-driven analytics that supports natural
language input in the FA setting.

*Haoran Zhang,Chenhao Zhu,Sicong Guo,Hanzhe Guo,Haiming Li,Donglin Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StarBench is a benchmark for evaluating vision-language models' ability to play turn-based RPGs with human-like competencies: mapping raw screenshots to low-level actions and deciding when to seek guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with human-like play in real clients - mapping raw screenshots to temporally coherent low-level actions while deciding when to ask for guidance remains an open challenge.

Method: StarBench standardizes evaluation across eight combat tasks in two regimes: direct control (raw screenshots to low-level primitives) and tool-assisted control (higher-level intents with optional OCR outputs). Includes ask-or-act diagnostic to measure guidance-seeking behavior.

Result: Results show sizable gaps in perception-to-control fidelity in direct regime, while judicious information seeking correlates with improved success.

Conclusion: StarBench establishes a reproducible yardstick for agentic information seeking and multimodal decision-making in real-client play, exposing current limitations of VLMs.

Abstract: Human players do more than press buttons: they ground what they see on screen
into precise keyboard-mouse actions and, when stuck, they seek information
before trying again. We ask whether current vision-language models (VLMs) can
do the same. Despite encouraging results under simplified control or tool
scaffolds, human-like play in a real client - mapping raw screenshots to
temporally coherent low-level actions while deciding when to ask for guidance -
remains an open challenge. We introduce StarBench, a turn-based RPG benchmark
derived from Honkai: Star Rail that targets these two human-like competencies:
multimodal decision-making from pixels to actions and agentic information
seeking. StarBench standardizes evaluation across eight combat tasks and two
regimes with shared tasks and metrics: (i) direct control, where agents receive
only screenshots and must emit low-level primitives (click and keypress) with
no semantic hints; and (ii) tool-assisted control, where higher-level intents
can be mapped to primitives by detectors and OCR outputs provide optional
textualized observations to ease UI grounding. To mirror human practice,
StarBench also includes an ask-or-act diagnostic that measures whether and when
agents choose to request brief guidance before proceeding, and how that choice
affects subsequent performance. We report reference baselines for contemporary
VLMs and a human reference. Results expose sizable gaps in

### [137] [AndroidControl-Curated: Revealing the True Potential of GUI Agents through Benchmark Purification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18488)
*Ho Fai Leung,Xiaoyan Xi,Fei Zuo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies flaws in AndroidControl benchmark that underestimate GUI agent capabilities, creates AndroidControl-Curated benchmark, and introduces Magma-R1-3B model that matches larger models' performance with 200x fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: On-device virtual assistants are limited by rigid APIs, and GUI agents are hindered by perceived poor performance due to flawed benchmarks that systematically underrate their capabilities.

Method: Enhanced AndroidControl benchmark through rigorous purification pipeline to create AndroidControl-Curated, and post-trained Magma-R1-3B model on 2.4k curated samples using minimal computational resources.

Result: On AndroidControl-Curated, state-of-the-art models achieve 75% success rates (15% improvement), and Magma-R1-3B delivers comparable performance to Qwen3-VL-235B despite being 200 times smaller.

Conclusion: On-device GUI agents are closer to practical deployment than previously thought, and the enhanced benchmark better reflects model capabilities for accelerating robust virtual assistant development.

Abstract: On-device virtual assistants like Siri and Google Assistant are increasingly
pivotal, yet their capabilities are hamstrung by a reliance on rigid,
developer-dependent APIs. GUI agents offer a powerful, API-independent
alternative, but their adoption is hindered by the perception of poor
performance, as even the best models (e.g. Qwen3-VL-235B) scores are capped at
around 60% on benchmarks like AndroidControl, far from viability for real-world
use. Our research reveals that issue lies not only with the models but with the
benchmarks themselves. We identified notable shortcomings in AndroidControl,
including ambiguities and factual errors, which systematically underrates agent
capabilities. To address this critical oversight, we enhanced AndroidControl
into AndroidControl-Curated, a refined version of the benchmark improved
through a rigorous purification pipeline. On this enhanced benchmark,
state-of-the-art models achieve success rates nearing 75% on complex tasks (15%
improvement), reflecting that on-device GUI agents are actually closer to
practical deployment than previously thought. We introduce our new SOTA model,
Magma-R1- 3B, post-trained on just 2.4k curated samples using 60 hours of an
H20 GPU (approximately $60). Despite being 200 times smaller in parameters,
this model delivers performance comparable to Qwen3- VL-235B. We release both
AndroidControl-Curated benchmark and Magma-R1 model to the research community,
encouraging adoption of this enhanced benchmark to better reflect model
capabilities and accelerate the development of robust, on-device virtual
assistants.

*Lianchen Jia,Chaoyang Li,Qian Houde,Tianchi Huang,Jiangchuan Liu,Lifeng Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Crucible is an LLM-driven agent that uses multi-level expert simulation to tune algorithms and quantitatively evaluate their Tuning Potential, bridging the gap between ideal performance and real-world tuning requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research focuses on algorithmic performance under ideal configurations but overlooks Tuning Potential - the critical aspect of how well algorithms can be tuned by domain experts for specific scenarios in production environments.

Method: Crucible employs an LLM-driven, multi-level expert simulation to tune algorithms and defines a formalized metric to quantitatively evaluate their Tuning Potential across various scenarios.

Result: Crucible systematically quantifies the tunable space across different algorithms and provides a new dimension for algorithm analysis and design, leading to performance improvements in real-world deployments.

Conclusion: Crucible effectively bridges the gap in evaluating Tuning Potential, offering a systematic approach to quantify tunable spaces and improve algorithm design for production environments.

Abstract: Control algorithms in production environments typically require domain
experts to tune their parameters and logic for specific scenarios. However,
existing research predominantly focuses on algorithmic performance under ideal
or default configurations, overlooking the critical aspect of Tuning Potential.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Crucible, an agent that employs an LLM-driven,
multi-level expert simulation to turn algorithms and defines a formalized
metric to quantitatively evaluate their Tuning Potential. We demonstrate
Crucible's effectiveness across a wide spectrum of case studies, from classic
control tasks to complex computer systems, and validate its findings in a
real-world deployment. Our experimental results reveal that Crucible
systematically quantifies the tunable space across different algorithms.
Furthermore, Crucible provides a new dimension for algorithm analysis and
design, which ultimately leads to performance improvements. Our code is
available at https://github.com/thu-media/Crucible.

*Hanze Guo,Jing Yao,Xiao Zhou,Xiaoyuan Yi,Xing Xie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: COUPLE is a counterfactual reasoning framework that uses structural causal modeling to align LLMs with pluralistic human values, addressing value complexity and steerability challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs serve diverse cultures and communities, there's a need to align them with pluralistic human values beyond average principles, considering value interdependence and priorities.

Method: Proposes COUPLE framework using structural causal models to capture value interdependencies and priorities, and applies counterfactual reasoning to generate outputs aligned with desired value objectives.

Result: COUPLE outperforms other baselines across diverse value objectives on two datasets with different value systems, and provides better interpretability through explicit causal modeling.

Conclusion: COUPLE effectively addresses value complexity and steerability challenges in pluralistic value alignment, offering improved performance and interpretability for aligning LLMs with diverse human values.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into
applications serving users across diverse cultures, communities and
demographics, it is critical to align LLMs with pluralistic human values beyond
average principles (e.g., HHH). In psychological and social value theories such
as Schwartz's Value Theory, pluralistic values are represented by multiple
value dimensions paired with various priorities. However, existing methods
encounter two challenges when aligning with such fine-grained value objectives:
1) they often treat multiple values as independent and equally important,
ignoring their interdependence and relative priorities (value complexity); 2)
they struggle to precisely control nuanced value priorities, especially those
underrepresented ones (value steerability). To handle these challenges, we
propose COUPLE, a COUnterfactual reasoning framework for PLuralistic valuE
alignment. It introduces a structural causal model (SCM) to feature complex
interdependency and prioritization among features, as well as the causal
relationship between high-level value dimensions and behaviors. Moreover, it
applies counterfactual reasoning to generate outputs aligned with any desired
value objectives. Benefitting from explicit causal modeling, COUPLE also
provides better interpretability. We evaluate COUPLE on two datasets with
different value systems and demonstrate that COUPLE advances other baselines
across diverse types of value objectives.

*Sarth Dubey,Subimal Ghosh,Udit Bhatia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Developed an operationally ready flood forecasting emulator that maintains performance under data delays, missing data, and inconsistencies by coupling long- and short-term memory networks with relaxed water-balance constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most hydrologic forecasting models are evaluated under ideal data conditions, but real-world operations require resilience to data latency, outages, and inconsistencies.

Method: Created five neural network architectures spanning different information availability scenarios, combining long- and short-term memory networks with relaxed water-balance constraints to preserve physical coherence. Trained in US catchments and tested in 5,000+ basins including regulated rivers in India.

Result: The emulator successfully reproduces GloFAS hydrological core and degrades smoothly as information quality declines. Transfer across different hydroclimatic and management regimes yields reduced but physically consistent performance.

Conclusion: Establishes operational robustness as a measurable property of hydrological machine learning and advances reliable real-time forecasting system design.

Abstract: Reliable hydrologic and flood forecasting requires models that remain stable
when input data are delayed, missing, or inconsistent. However, most advances
in rainfall-runoff prediction have been evaluated under ideal data conditions,
emphasizing accuracy rather than operational resilience. Here, we develop an
operationally ready emulator of the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS) that
couples long- and short-term memory networks with a relaxed water-balance
constraint to preserve physical coherence. Five architectures span a continuum
of information availability: from complete historical and forecast forcings to
scenarios with data latency and outages, allowing systematic evaluation of
robustness. Trained in minimally managed catchments across the United States
and tested in more than 5,000 basins, including heavily regulated rivers in
India, the emulator reproduces the hydrological core of GloFAS and degrades
smoothly as information quality declines. Transfer across contrasting
hydroclimatic and management regimes yields reduced yet physically consistent
performance, defining the limits of generalization under data scarcity and
human influence. The framework establishes operational robustness as a
measurable property of hydrological machine learning and advances the design of
reliable real-time forecasting systems.

*Yuncheng Hua,Sion Weatherhead,Mehdi Jafari,Hao Xue,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SOCIA-Nabla is an agentic framework that treats simulator construction as code optimization using LLM-driven agents in a computation graph with Textual-Gradient Descent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To convert brittle prompt pipelines into reproducible, constraint-aware simulator code generation that scales across domains and simulation granularities.

Method: End-to-end framework with specialized LLM-driven agents as graph nodes, executing loss-driven loop (code synthesis -> execution -> evaluation -> code repair) using Textual-Gradient Descent.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art overall accuracy across three CPS tasks: User Modeling, Mask Adoption, and Personal Mobility.

Conclusion: SOCIA-Nabla successfully unifies multi-agent orchestration with loss-aligned optimization to create scalable, reproducible simulator code generation.

Abstract: In this paper, we present SOCIA-Nabla, an end-to-end, agentic framework that
treats simulator construction asinstance optimization over code within a
textual computation graph. Specialized LLM-driven agents are embedded as graph
nodes, and a workflow manager executes a loss-driven loop: code synthesis ->
execution -> evaluation -> code repair. The optimizer performs Textual-Gradient
Descent (TGD), while human-in-the-loop interaction is reserved for task-spec
confirmation, minimizing expert effort and keeping the code itself as the
trainable object. Across three CPS tasks, i.e., User Modeling, Mask Adoption,
and Personal Mobility, SOCIA-Nabla attains state-of-the-art overall accuracy.
By unifying multi-agent orchestration with a loss-aligned optimization view,
SOCIA-Nabla converts brittle prompt pipelines into reproducible,
constraint-aware simulator code generation that scales across domains and
simulation granularities. This work is under review, and we will release the
code soon.

*Federico Barbero,Xiangming Gu,Christopher A. Choquette-Choo,Chawin Sitawarin,Matthew Jagielski,Itay Yona,Petar Veličković,Ilia Shumailov,Jamie Hayes*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Models can extract significant alignment training data from post-trained models using embedding-based similarity metrics, revealing overlooked risks in data extraction and distillation practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the feasibility of extracting alignment training data from post-trained models and understand the risks associated with data regurgitation in distillation practices.

Method: Used embedding models to measure semantic similarities between extracted data and original training data, rather than traditional string matching metrics like edit distance.

Result: Found that models readily regurgitate training data from post-training phases (SFT/RL), and this extracted data can be used to train base models, recovering meaningful performance. Embedding-based approach revealed 10x more extractable data than string matching.

Conclusion: Exposes overlooked risks in alignment data extraction and suggests that distillation practices indirectly train models on original datasets through data regurgitation.

Abstract: In this work, we show that it is possible to extract significant amounts of
alignment training data from a post-trained model -- useful to steer the model
to improve certain capabilities such as long-context reasoning, safety,
instruction following, and maths. While the majority of related work on
memorisation has focused on measuring success of training data extraction
through string matching, we argue that embedding models are better suited for
our specific goals. Distances measured through a high quality embedding model
can identify semantic similarities between strings that a different metric such
as edit distance will struggle to capture. In fact, in our investigation,
approximate string matching would have severely undercounted (by a conservative
estimate of $10\times$) the amount of data that can be extracted due to trivial
artifacts that deflate the metric. Interestingly, we find that models readily
regurgitate training data that was used in post-training phases such as SFT or
RL. We show that this data can be then used to train a base model, recovering a
meaningful amount of the original performance. We believe our work exposes a
possibly overlooked risk towards extracting alignment data. Finally, our work
opens up an interesting discussion on the downstream effects of distillation
practices: since models seem to be regurgitating aspects of their training set,
distillation can therefore be thought of as indirectly training on the model's
original dataset.

Result: Empirical results show QuantEvolve outperforms conventional baselines and produces diverse, sophisticated strategies that adapt to market regime shifts and individual investment needs.

Conclusion: QuantEvolve effectively automates trading strategy development while maintaining diversity and adaptability, with released dataset supporting future research.

Abstract: Automating quantitative trading strategy development in dynamic markets is
challenging, especially with increasing demand for personalized investment
solutions. Existing methods often fail to explore the vast strategy space while
preserving the diversity essential for robust performance across changing
market conditions. We present QuantEvolve, an evolutionary framework that
combines quality-diversity optimization with hypothesis-driven strategy
generation. QuantEvolve employs a feature map aligned with investor
preferences, such as strategy type, risk profile, turnover, and return
characteristics, to maintain a diverse set of effective strategies. It also
integrates a hypothesis-driven multi-agent system to systematically explore the
strategy space through iterative generation and evaluation. This approach
produces diverse, sophisticated strategies that adapt to both market regime
shifts and individual investment needs. Empirical results show that QuantEvolve
outperforms conventional baselines, validating its effectiveness. We release a
dataset of evolved strategies to support future research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VAR is a novel framework that addresses MLLM hallucinations by decomposing reasoning into traceable evidence grounding and search-based CoT generation with backtracking, guided by multi-faceted reward functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the high hallucination tendency and brittle linear reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that lead to failures in complex tasks.

Method: Decomposes reasoning into traceable evidence grounding and search-based chain-of-thought generation with backtracking mechanism, guided by semantic and geometric self-verification reward functions.

Result: VAR-7B sets new state-of-the-art on hallucination and safety benchmarks, significantly outperforming open-source models and showing competitive performance against proprietary systems.

Conclusion: VAR effectively addresses MLLM limitations through structured search over reasoning trajectories with self-correction mechanisms, demonstrating superior performance in reducing hallucinations.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), despite their advances, are
hindered by their high hallucination tendency and heavy reliance on brittle,
linear reasoning processes, leading to failures in complex tasks. To address
these limitations, we introduce Visual Attention Reasoning (VAR), a novel
framework that recasts grounded reasoning as a structured search over a
reasoning trajectory space. VAR decomposes the reasoning process into two key
stages: traceable evidence grounding and search-based chain-of-thought (CoT)
generation, which incorporates a backtracking mechanism for self-correction.
The search is guided by a multi-faceted reward function with semantic and
geometric self-verification components, which penalize outputs that are not
faithfully grounded in the visual input. We provide a theoretical analysis for
our search strategy, validating its capability to find the correct solution
with high probability. Experimental results show that our 7B model, VAR-7B,
sets a new state-of-the-art on a comprehensive suite of hallucination and
safety benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing open-source models and
demonstrating competitive performance against leading proprietary systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new classification approach combining data mining-derived association rules with tree-based models to improve predictive performance and generate more general explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance both predictive performance and explanation quality in classification tasks by leveraging knowledge from data mining alongside traditional tree-based models.

Method: Use data mining to derive association rules (including negations) from data, then integrate these rules with decision trees and random forests to improve classification and generate more general abductive explanations.

Result: Experiments show improved predictive performance and smaller explanation sizes for both decision trees and random forests when using the proposed approach.

Conclusion: Combining data mining-derived association rules with tree-based models offers benefits in both predictive accuracy and explanation quality for classification tasks.

Abstract: We present a new approach to classification that combines data and knowledge.
In this approach, data mining is used to derive association rules (possibly
with negations) from data. Those rules are leveraged to increase the predictive
performance of tree-based models (decision trees and random forests) used for a
classification task. They are also used to improve the corresponding
explanation task through the generation of abductive explanations that are more
general than those derivable without taking such rules into account.
Experiments show that for the two tree-based models under consideration,
benefits can be offered by the approach in terms of predictive performance and
in terms of explanation sizes.

TL;DR: The paper studies expressivity of abstract vs structured argumentation models with qualitative uncertainty, introducing a new expressivity measure and providing both negative and positive results comparing incomplete AFs and ASPIC+.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in studying plausible instantiations of abstract uncertainty models in argumentation, by grounding uncertainty in argument components within rules and premises.

Method: Introduces a notion of expressivity that handles both abstract and structured formalisms, and compares expressivity of abstract models (incomplete AFs and their extensions with dependencies) with structured models (ASPIC+).

Result: Presents both negative and positive expressivity results showing the comparative expressivity between abstract and structured models of argumentation with uncertainty.

Conclusion: The expressivity analysis provides insights into how abstract and structured argumentation models with uncertainty compare, affecting both theoretical understanding and practical applications.

Abstract: Modelling qualitative uncertainty in formal argumentation is essential both
for practical applications and theoretical understanding. Yet, most of the
existing works focus on \textit{abstract} models for arguing with uncertainty.
Following a recent trend in the literature, we tackle the open question of
studying plausible instantiations of these abstract models. To do so, we ground
the uncertainty of arguments in their components, structured within rules and
premises. Our main technical contributions are: i) the introduction of a notion
of expressivity that can handle abstract and structured formalisms, and ii) the
presentation of both negative and positive expressivity results, comparing the
expressivity of abstract and structured models of argumentation with
uncertainty. These results affect incomplete abstract argumentation frameworks,
and their extension with dependencies, on the abstract side, and ASPIC+, on the
structured side.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RAG systems use bandit learning methods to dynamically select informative sub-queries during query decomposition and document retrieval, achieving significant improvements in precision and downstream generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off in RAG systems between retrieving broadly enough to capture relevant material while limiting retrieval to avoid noise and computational costs.

Method: Formulate query decomposition and document retrieval as an exploitation-exploration setting using bandit learning methods, where document retrieval builds beliefs about sub-query utility to inform exploitation/exploration decisions.

Result: 35% gain in document-level precision, 15% increase in α-nDCG, and better performance on long-form generation tasks when using rank information and human judgments for document relevance estimation.

Conclusion: Bandit learning methods effectively balance the retrieval trade-off in RAG systems, significantly improving document selection quality and downstream task performance.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems address complex user requests by
decomposing them into subqueries, retrieving potentially relevant documents for
each, and then aggregating them to generate an answer. Efficiently selecting
informative documents requires balancing a key trade-off: (i) retrieving
broadly enough to capture all the relevant material, and (ii) limiting
retrieval to avoid excessive noise and computational cost. We formulate query
decomposition and document retrieval in an exploitation-exploration setting,
where retrieving one document at a time builds a belief about the utility of a
given sub-query and informs the decision to continue exploiting or exploring an
alternative. We experiment with a variety of bandit learning methods and
demonstrate their effectiveness in dynamically selecting the most informative
sub-queries. Our main finding is that estimating document relevance using rank
information and human judgments yields a 35% gain in document-level precision,
15% increase in {\alpha}-nDCG, and better performance on the downstream task of
long-form generation.

TL;DR: SherlockLLM is a dialogue-driven retrieval framework that uses Reinforcement Learning to learn optimal questioning strategies for clarifying ambiguous user queries, achieving performance comparable to binary search on structured tasks and outperforming baselines on unstructured tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User queries in information retrieval are often ambiguous, making it challenging to identify user intent from single queries. Existing dialogue-based interactive retrieval systems lack explicit strategies to ask the most informative questions efficiently.

Method: Proposed SherlockLLM framework that learns an optimal questioning strategy via Reinforcement Learning (RL), training an agent to generate sequences of binary questions to narrow down search space efficiently without requiring large-scale annotated dialogue data.

Result: On structured tasks, performance matches strong baselines and approaches theoretical optimal defined by binary search. On challenging unstructured tasks, significantly outperforms baselines, demonstrating ability to learn effective information-seeking dialogue policies.

Conclusion: SherlockLLM is a robust and efficient solution for dialogue-driven retrieval that effectively learns questioning strategies through RL, showing strong performance on both structured and unstructured retrieval tasks.

Abstract: User queries in information retrieval are often ambiguous, making it
challenging for systems to identify a user's target from a single query. While
recent dialogue-based interactive retrieval systems can clarify user intent,
they are inefficient as they often lack an explicit strategy to ask the most
informative questions. To address this limitation, we propose SherlockLLM, a
dialogue-driven retrieval framework that learns an optimal questioning strategy
via Reinforcement Learning (RL) and avoids the need for large-scale annotated
dialogue data. In our framework, an agent is trained to generate a sequence of
binary questions to efficiently narrow down the search space. To validate our
approach, we introduce a benchmark with both structured and unstructured tasks.
Experimental results show that SherlockLLM is a robust and efficient solution.
On the structured tasks, its performance matches strong baselines and
approaches the theoretical optimal defined by binary search. On the challenging
unstructured task, our agent significantly outperforms these baselines,
showcasing its ability to learn a highly effective information-seeking dialogue
policy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate change intensifies harmful algal blooms (cyanobacteria) that threaten aquatic ecosystems and human health, while traditional monitoring methods are labor-intensive with limited coverage.

Method: Integrates GeoSAM-assisted human evaluation for high-quality segmentation mask curation and fine-tunes vision language model on severity prediction using NASA's Cyanobacteria Aggregated Manual Labels (CAML).

Result: ALGOS achieves robust performance on both segmentation and severity-level estimation.

Conclusion: The system paves the way toward practical and automated cyanobacterial monitoring systems.

Abstract: Climate change is intensifying the occurrence of harmful algal bloom (HAB),
particularly cyanobacteria, which threaten aquatic ecosystems and human health
through oxygen depletion, toxin release, and disruption of marine biodiversity.
Traditional monitoring approaches, such as manual water sampling, remain
labor-intensive and limited in spatial and temporal coverage. Recent advances
in vision-language models (VLMs) for remote sensing have shown potential for
scalable AI-driven solutions, yet challenges remain in reasoning over imagery
and quantifying bloom severity. In this work, we introduce ALGae Observation
and Segmentation (ALGOS), a segmentation-and-reasoning system for HAB
monitoring that combines remote sensing image understanding with severity
estimation. Our approach integrates GeoSAM-assisted human evaluation for
high-quality segmentation mask curation and fine-tunes vision language model on
severity prediction using the Cyanobacteria Aggregated Manual Labels (CAML)
from NASA. Experiments demonstrate that ALGOS achieves robust performance on
both segmentation and severity-level estimation, paving the way toward
practical and automated cyanobacterial monitoring systems.

Motivation: To understand evolving research trends and demographic/geographical forces shaping scientific investment, particularly in light of equity, diversity, and inclusion commitments, by analyzing long-term funding data from Canada's NSERC.

Method: Comparative evaluation of three topic modeling approaches (LDA, STM, BERTopic) on 18 years of NSERC research proposals (2005-2022), plus development of COFFEE algorithm for covariate effect estimation in BERTopic.

Result: BERTopic outperformed other models by identifying more granular, coherent, and emergent themes (e.g., AI expansion). COFFEE-enabled covariate analysis revealed distinct provincial research specializations and consistent gender-based thematic patterns across disciplines.

Conclusion: The findings provide empirical foundation for funding organizations to develop more equitable and impactful funding strategies, enhancing scientific ecosystem effectiveness through data-driven insights into research trends and demographic influences.

Abstract: Optimizing national scientific investment requires a clear understanding of
evolving research trends and the demographic and geographical forces shaping
them, particularly in light of commitments to equity, diversity, and inclusion.
This study addresses this need by analyzing 18 years (2005-2022) of research
proposals funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of
Canada (NSERC). We conducted a comprehensive comparative evaluation of three
topic modelling approaches: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Structural Topic
Modelling (STM), and BERTopic. We also introduced a novel algorithm, named
COFFEE, designed to enable robust covariate effect estimation for BERTopic.
This advancement addresses a significant gap, as BERTopic lacks a native
function for covariate analysis, unlike the probabilistic STM. Our findings
highlight that while all models effectively delineate core scientific domains,
BERTopic outperformed by consistently identifying more granular, coherent, and
emergent themes, such as the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence.
Additionally, the covariate analysis, powered by COFFEE, confirmed distinct
provincial research specializations and revealed consistent gender-based
thematic patterns across various scientific disciplines. These insights offer a
robust empirical foundation for funding organizations to formulate more
equitable and impactful funding strategies, thereby enhancing the effectiveness
of the scientific ecosystem.

Motivation: To investigate the performance and reliability of hybrid electric systems combining batteries and fuel cells for small vehicles, with potential for scaling to larger applications.

Method: Experimental testing under various load and environmental conditions, combined with data-driven analysis using signal processing, machine learning (including Temporal Convolutional Networks), anomaly detection, and change point detection methods.

Result: Hybrid system showed improved electrical performance and reliability with fewer critical faults compared to battery-only operation. Machine learning accurately distinguished throttle levels and predicted voltage behavior.

Conclusion: Integration of PEM fuel cell with NiMH batteries significantly enhances performance for small electric vehicles and provides a baseline for scaling to larger vehicles, with potential for off-grid renewable hydrogen use.

Abstract: This paper presents an experimental investigation and performance evaluation
of a hybrid electric radio-controlled car powered by a Nickel-Metal Hydride
battery combined with a renewable Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell system.
The study evaluates the performance of the system under various load-carrying
scenarios and varying environmental conditions, simulating real-world operating
conditions including throttle operation. In order to build a predictive model,
gather operational insights, and detect anomalies, data-driven analyses using
signal processing and modern machine learning techniques were employed.
Specifically, machine learning techniques were used to distinguish throttle
levels with high precision based on the operational data. Anomaly and change
point detection methods enhanced voltage stability, resulting in fewer critical
faults in the hybrid system compared to battery-only operation. Temporal
Convolutional Networks were effectively employed to predict voltage behavior,
demonstrating potential for use in planning the locations of fueling or
charging stations. Moreover, integration with a solar-powered electrolyzer
confirmed the system's potential for off-grid, renewable hydrogen use. The
results indicate that integrating a Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell with
Nickel-Metal Hydride batteries significantly improves electrical performance
and reliability for small electric vehicles, and these findings can be a
potential baseline for scaling up to larger vehicles.

TL;DR: A data-driven framework using vibration analysis and machine learning for real-time monitoring of gear power honing, achieving high classification accuracy for gear quality categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional post-process inspection and SPC methods fail to detect transient machining anomalies in real-time, while modern gear manufacturing requires high-precision finishing to meet stringent NVH requirements.

Method: Continuous vibration data acquisition via accelerometers, time-frequency signal analysis, feature extraction using three subspace learning methods (PCA, PCA+LDA, R-UMLDA), and classification with SVM to predict four gear quality categories.

Result: The framework achieves high classification accuracy (up to 100%) in industrial settings, with interpretable spectral features that correlate with process dynamics.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables practical integration into real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance systems for gear power honing operations.

Abstract: In modern gear manufacturing, stringent Noise, Vibration, and Harshness (NVH)
requirements demand high-precision finishing operations such as power honing.
Conventional quality control strategies rely on post-process inspections and
Statistical Process Control (SPC), which fail to capture transient machining
anomalies and cannot ensure real-time defect detection. This study proposes a
novel, data-driven framework for in-process monitoring of gear power honing
using vibration signal analysis and machine learning. Our proposed methodology
involves continuous data acquisition via accelerometers, followed by
time-frequency signal analysis. We investigate and compare the efficacy of
three subspace learning methods for features extraction: (1) Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction; (2) a two-stage
framework combining PCA with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for enhanced
class separation; and (3) Uncorrelated Multilinear Discriminant Analysis with
Regularization (R-UMLDA), adapted for tensor data, which enforces feature
decorrelation and includes regularization for small sample sizes. These
extracted features are then fed into a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier
to predict four distinct gear quality categories, established through rigorous
geometrical inspections and test bench results of assembled gearboxes. The
models are trained and validated on an experimental dataset collected in an
industrial context during gear power-honing operations, with gears classified
into four different quality categories. The proposed framework achieves high
classification accuracy (up to 100%) in an industrial setting. The approach
offers interpretable spectral features that correlate with process dynamics,
enabling practical integration into real-time monitoring and predictive
maintenance systems.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Proposes a channel-aware vector quantization (CAVQ) algorithm within a joint source-channel coding framework (VQJSCC) for digital semantic communication, addressing the limitations of existing methods that ignore channel state information during codebook optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning-based semantic communication methods rely on analog or semi-digital transmission, limiting compatibility with modern digital infrastructures. Current vector quantization approaches for discrete transmission neglect channel state information during codebook optimization, resulting in suboptimal robustness.

Method: Developed VQJSCC framework with CAVQ algorithm that integrates channel transition probabilities into quantization, aligning easily confused symbols with semantically similar codewords. Introduced multi-codebook alignment mechanism to handle codebook-modulation order mismatches by decomposing transmission into multiple independently optimized subchannels.

Result: Experimental results show VQJSCC effectively mitigates the digital cliff effect, achieves superior reconstruction quality across various modulation schemes, and outperforms state-of-the-art digital semantic communication baselines in both robustness and efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed channel-aware vector quantization approach successfully bridges the gap between semantic communication and digital infrastructure compatibility while enhancing robustness through explicit consideration of channel characteristics during codebook optimization.

Abstract: Deep learning-based semantic communication has largely relied on analog or
semi-digital transmission, which limits compatibility with modern digital
communication infrastructures. Recent studies have employed vector quantization
(VQ) to enable discrete semantic transmission, yet existing methods neglect
channel state information during codebook optimization, leading to suboptimal
robustness. To bridge this gap, we propose a channel-aware vector quantization
(CAVQ) algorithm within a joint source-channel coding (JSCC) framework, termed
VQJSCC, established on a discrete memoryless channel. In this framework,
semantic features are discretized and directly mapped to modulation
constellation symbols, while CAVQ integrates channel transition probabilities
into the quantization process, aligning easily confused symbols with
semantically similar codewords. A multi-codebook alignment mechanism is further
introduced to handle mismatches between codebook order and modulation order by
decomposing the transmission stream into multiple independently optimized
subchannels. Experimental results demonstrate that VQJSCC effectively mitigates
the digital cliff effect, achieves superior reconstruction quality across
various modulation schemes, and outperforms state-of-the-art digital semantic
communication baselines in both robustness and efficiency.

Motivation: To understand how ECG complexity varies with cardiac pathology using nonlinear analysis methods.

Method: Extracted nonlinear measures from lead II ECGs and cross-channel metrics from leads II, V2, AVL using Spearman correlations and mutual information from the PTB-XL dataset.

Result: Found significant differences between healthy and diseased individuals in almost all measures (p<.001), and improved classification AUC from 0.86 (baseline) to 0.87 (nonlinear measures) and 0.90 (with cross-time series metrics).

Conclusion: Nonlinear complexity measures from ECGs provide valuable biomarkers for cardiac pathology detection and significantly enhance machine learning classification performance.

Abstract: The complex dynamics of the heart are reflected in its electrical activity,
captured through electrocardiograms (ECGs). In this study we use nonlinear time
series analysis to understand how ECG complexity varies with cardiac pathology.
Using the large PTB-XL dataset, we extracted nonlinear measures from lead II
ECGs, and cross-channel metrics (leads II, V2, AVL) using Spearman correlations
and mutual information. Significant differences between diseased and healthy
individuals were found in almost all measures between healthy and diseased
classes, and between 5 diagnostic superclasses ($p<.001$). Moreover,
incorporating these complexity quantifiers into machine learning models
substantially improved classification accuracy measured using area under the
ROC curve (AUC) from 0.86 (baseline) to 0.87 (nonlinear measures) and 0.90
(including cross-time series metrics).

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A novel gridless 2D direction-of-arrival estimation method for uniform circular arrays using single snapshot data, combining manifold transformation and source estimation in one optimization problem solved via inexact Augmented Lagrangian Method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional gridless methods fail in single-snapshot scenarios due to high computational costs and lack of robustness, especially for 2D DOA estimation with uniform circular arrays.

Method: Jointly estimates manifold transformation matrix and source azimuth-elevation pairs in a unified optimization problem, solved efficiently using inexact Augmented Lagrangian Method without semidefinite programming.

Result: Simulation results show robust and high-resolution gridless 2D-DOA estimates, demonstrating effectiveness for challenging single-snapshot array signal processing applications.

Conclusion: The proposed iALM framework successfully overcomes computational and robustness limitations of conventional methods, providing reliable gridless 2D-DOA estimation from single snapshot data.

Abstract: This paper tackles the challenging problem of gridless two-dimensional (2D)
direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation for a uniform circular array (UCA) from a
single snapshot of data. Conventional gridless methods often fail in this
scenario due to prohibitive computational costs or a lack of robustness. We
propose a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by jointly
estimating a manifold transformation matrix and the source azimuth-elevation
pairs within a single, unified optimization problem. This problem is solved
efficiently using an inexact Augmented Lagrangian Method (iALM), which
completely circumvents the need for semidefinite programming. By unifying the
objectives of data fidelity and transformation robustness, our approach is
uniquely suited for the demanding single-snapshot case. Simulation results
confirm that the proposed iALM framework provides robust and high-resolution,
gridless 2D-DOA estimates, establishing its efficacy for challenging array
signal processing applications.

*Zhixing Wang,Renzhi Yuan,Haifeng Yao,Chuang Yang,Mugen Peng*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A comprehensive satellite-to-underwater laser communication channel model using an analytical-Monte Carlo hybrid approach that considers both particles and turbulence effects across atmospheric, air-water interface, and underwater channels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing StULC channel models either focus on isolated channels or neglect combined effects of particles and turbulence on laser propagation, creating a need for comprehensive modeling.

Method: Hybrid analytical-Monte Carlo approach: extended Huygens-Fresnel principle for turbulent atmosphere, closed-form PDF for air-water interface photon direction, and Monte Carlo method for underwater power distribution.

Result: Underwater particle concentration has much greater impact on communication performance than atmospheric or underwater turbulence; wind speed at air-water interface doesn't significantly worsen performance.

Conclusion: The proposed comprehensive StULC channel model successfully captures combined particle and turbulence effects, revealing underwater particle concentration as the dominant factor affecting communication performance.

Abstract: Channel modeling for satellite-to-underwater laser communication (StULC)
links remains challenging due to long distances and the diversity of the
channel constituents. The StULC channel is typically segmented into three
isolated channels: the atmospheric channel, the air-water interface channel,
and the underwater channel. Previous studies involving StULC channel modeling
either focused on separated channels or neglected the combined effects of
particles and turbulence on laser propagation. In this paper, we established a
comprehensive StULC channel model by an analytical-Monte Carlo hybrid approach,
taking into account the effects of both particles and turbulence. We first
obtained the intensity distribution of the transmitted laser beam after passing
through the turbulent atmosphere based on the extended Huygens-Fresnel
principle. Then we derived a closed-form probability density function of the
photon propagating direction after passing through the air-water interface,
which greatly simplified the modeling of StULC links. At last, we employed a
Monte Carlo method to model the underwater links and obtained the power
distribution at the receiving plane. Based on the proposed StULC channel model,
we analyzed the bit error rate and the outage probability under different
environmental conditions. Numerical results demonstrated that, the influence of
underwater particle concentration on the communication performance is much
pronounced than those of both the atmospheric turbulence and the underwater
turbulence. Notably, increasing the wind speed at the air-water interface does
not significantly worsen the communication performance of the StULC links.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Proposes an efficient adaptive beamforming technique using preprocessing-based spatial sampling to handle steering vector mismatches and covariance matrix reconstruction, with improved interference suppression and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address steering vector estimation mismatches and data covariance matrix reconstruction problems in adaptive beamforming systems, particularly for robust interference suppression.

Method: Uses DoA estimation of interfering sources, general linear combination algorithm for IPNC matrix reconstruction, preprocessing-based spatial sampling with sample covariance matrix, and power method for SOI steering vector calculation.

Result: Simulation results demonstrate the method's effectiveness in interference suppression and computational efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed PPBSS technique provides robust beamforming performance with improved computational efficiency for handling steering vector mismatches and covariance matrix reconstruction.

Abstract: This work proposes an efficient, robust adaptive beamforming technique to
deal with steering vector (SV) estimation mismatches and data covariance matrix
reconstruction problems. In particular, the direction-of-arrival(DoA) of
interfering sources is estimated with available snapshots in which the angular
sectors of the interfering signals are computed adaptively. Then, we utilize
the well-known general linear combination algorithm to reconstruct the
interference-plus-noise covariance (IPNC) matrix using preprocessing-based
spatial sampling (PPBSS). We demonstrate that the preprocessing matrix can be
replaced by the sample covariance matrix (SCM) in the shrinkage method. A power
spectrum sampling strategy is then devised based on a preprocessing matrix
computed with the estimated angular sectors' information. Moreover, the
covariance matrix for the signal is formed for the angular sector of the
signal-of-interest (SOI), which allows for calculating an SV for the SOI using
the power method. An analysis of the array beampattern in the proposed PPBSS
technique is carried out, and a study of the computational cost of competing
approaches is conducted. Simulation results show the proposed method's
effectiveness compared to existing approaches.

*Xin Li,Jingzhi Hu,Yinghui He,Hongbo Wang,Jin Gan,Jun Luo*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: WiAnchor is a training framework for Wi-Fi-based multi-person human activity recognition that enables efficient cross-domain adaptation even when some activity categories are unavailable during fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wi-Fi-based HAR faces challenges in multi-person scenarios due to coarse spatial resolution. While personal Wi-Fi devices offer a solution through near-field sensing, cross-domain adaptation requires fine-tuning that becomes difficult when certain activity categories are unavailable.

Method: Three-step framework: 1) Pre-training with enlarged inter-class feature margins for better activity separability; 2) Fine-tuning with anchor matching mechanism for cross-domain adaptation, filtering subject-specific interference using incomplete activity categories; 3) Recognition improvement based on feature-level similarity with anchors.

Result: Achieved over 90% cross-domain accuracy with absent activity categories on a comprehensive dataset.

Conclusion: WiAnchor effectively addresses the challenge of cross-domain adaptation in multi-person Wi-Fi HAR when activity categories are incomplete, providing a practical solution for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Wi-Fi-based human activity recognition (HAR) provides substantial convenience
and has emerged as a thriving research field, yet the coarse spatial resolution
inherent to Wi-Fi significantly hinders its ability to distinguish multiple
subjects. By exploiting the near-field domination effect, establishing a
dedicated sensing link for each subject through their personal Wi-Fi device
offers a promising solution for multi-person HAR under native traffic. However,
due to the subject-specific characteristics and irregular patterns of
near-field signals, HAR neural network models require fine-tuning (FT) for
cross-domain adaptation, which becomes particularly challenging with certain
categories unavailable. In this paper, we propose WiAnchor, a novel training
framework for efficient cross-domain adaptation in the presence of incomplete
activity categories. This framework processes Wi-Fi signals embedded with
irregular time information in three steps: during pre-training, we enlarge
inter-class feature margins to enhance the separability of activities; in the
FT stage, we innovate an anchor matching mechanism for cross-domain adaptation,
filtering subject-specific interference informed by incomplete activity
categories, rather than attempting to extract complete features from them;
finally, the recognition of input samples is further improved based on their
feature-level similarity with anchors. We construct a comprehensive dataset to
thoroughly evaluate WiAnchor, achieving over 90% cross-domain accuracy with
absent activity categories.

Motivation: Intracavitary atrial electrograms provide high-resolution cardiac insights but are often contaminated by noise and remain high-dimensional, limiting real-time analysis capabilities.

Method: CLARAE uses three key principles: downsampling with pooling, hybrid interpolation-convolution upsampling, and bounded latent space. It was evaluated on 495,731 EGM segments from 29 patients across three rhythm types.

Result: CLARAE achieved F1-scores above 0.97 for all rhythm types in classification tasks, showed clear clustering by rhythm in latent space, and consistently ranked among top performers in denoising tasks across signal-to-noise ratios from -5 to 15 dB.

Conclusion: CLARAE combines robust denoising with compact, discriminative representations, offering a practical foundation for clinical workflows including rhythm discrimination, signal quality assessment, and real-time mapping.

Abstract: Intracavitary atrial electrograms (EGMs) provide high-resolution insights
into cardiac electrophysiology but are often contaminated by noise and remain
high-dimensional, limiting real-time analysis. We introduce CLARAE
(CLArity-preserving Reconstruction AutoEncoder), a one-dimensional
encoder--decoder designed for atrial EGMs, which achieves both high-fidelity
reconstruction and a compact 64-dimensional latent representation. CLARAE is
designed to preserve waveform morphology, mitigate reconstruction artifacts,
and produce interpretable embeddings through three principles: downsampling
with pooling, a hybrid interpolation--convolution upsampling path, and a
bounded latent space.
  We evaluated CLARAE on 495,731 EGM segments (unipolar and bipolar) from 29
patients across three rhythm types (AF, SR300, SR600). Performance was
benchmarked against six state-of-the-art autoencoders using reconstruction
metrics, rhythm classification, and robustness across signal-to-noise ratios
from -5 to 15 dB. In downstream rhythm classification, CLARAE achieved
F1-scores above 0.97 for all rhythm types, and its latent space showed clear
clustering by rhythm. In denoising tasks, it consistently ranked among the top
performers for both unipolar and bipolar signals.
  In order to promote reproducibility and enhance accessibility, we offer an
interactive web-based application. This platform enables users to explore
pre-trained CLARAE models, visualize the reconstructions, and compute metrics
in real time. Overall, CLARAE combines robust denoising with compact,
discriminative representations, offering a practical foundation for clinical
workflows such as rhythm discrimination, signal quality assessment, and
real-time mapping.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ISATNs are key for 6G global connectivity but risk unsustainable energy use and carbon emissions, requiring carbon-aware solutions beyond traditional energy efficiency.

Method: Proposes a carbon-aware orchestration framework using Digital Twin technology with multi-timescale PDCA loop, combining day-ahead forecasting with real-time optimization. Uses ISATN-specific controls like carbon-aware handovers, UAV duty cycling, and renewable-aware edge placement.

Result: Simulation with real carbon intensity data shows up to 29% lower gCO2/bit than QoS-only orchestration, while improving renewable utilization and resilience under adverse events.

Conclusion: The proposed carbon-aware framework effectively reduces emissions in ISATNs while maintaining performance and enhancing sustainability metrics.

Abstract: Integrated Satellite Aerial Terrestrial Networks (ISATNs) are envisioned as
key enablers of 6G, providing global connectivity for applications such as
autonomous transportation, Industrial IoT, and disaster response. Their
large-scale deployment, however, risks unsustainable energy use and carbon
emissions. This work advances prior energy-aware studies by proposing a
carbon-aware orchestration framework for ISATNs that leverages Digital Twin
(DT) technology. The framework adopts grams of CO$_2$-equivalent per bit
(gCO$_2$/bit) as a primary sustainability metric and implements a multi
timescale Plan Do Check Act (PDCA) loop that combines day-ahead forecasting
with real-time adaptive optimization. ISATN-specific control knobs, including
carbon-aware handovers, UAV duty cycling, and renewable-aware edge placement,
are exploited to reduce emissions. Simulation results with real carbon
intensity data show up to 29\% lower gCO$_2$/bit than QoS-only orchestration,
while improving renewable utilization and resilience under adverse events.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting high-quality EEG data is challenging due to sensor costs, acquisition time, and inter-subject variability, creating a need for synthetic data generation to complement datasets.

Method: Preprocessing real EEG data, training diffusion models to reconstruct EEG channels from noise, and evaluating generated signals using signal-level and task-level metrics with classifiers like KNN, CNN, and U-Net.

Result: Generated synthetic EEG signals achieved classification accuracies above 95% with low mean squared error and high correlation with real signals, improving classification performance in EEG-based BCIs.

Conclusion: Synthetic EEG signals produced by diffusion models can effectively address data scarcity and improve classification performance in EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely used, non-invasive method for
capturing brain activity, and is particularly relevant for applications in
Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI). However, collecting high-quality EEG data
remains a major challenge due to sensor costs, acquisition time, and
inter-subject variability. To address these limitations, this study proposes a
methodology for generating synthetic EEG signals associated with motor imagery
brain tasks using Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM). The approach involves
preprocessing real EEG data, training a diffusion model to reconstruct EEG
channels from noise, and evaluating the quality of the generated signals
through both signal-level and task-level metrics. For validation, we employed
classifiers such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Convolutional Neural Networks

in classification tasks. The generated data achieved classification accuracies
above 95%, with low mean squared error and high correlation with real signals.
  Our results demonstrate that synthetic EEG signals produced by diffusion

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A two-phase model-based strategy for leakage detection: DMA identification followed by pipe pre-localization, using anomaly detection and AMSI index to minimize false positives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To help water utilities detect and localize leaks efficiently with minimum inspection costs, addressing the challenge of identifying anomalies at DMA level.

Method: Two-phase approach: 1) Identify District Metering Area (DMA), 2) Pre-localize pipe sequence within DMA using anomaly detection. Uses Asset Management Support Indicator (AMSI) to reduce false positives.

Result: Strategy successfully tested on two real Apulian water distribution networks, demonstrating effective leakage detection and pre-localization with limited false positives.

Conclusion: The proposed strategy provides an effective solution for water utilities to detect and localize leaks efficiently, with AMSI proving valuable for reducing false positives in DMA identification.

Abstract: The present work proposes a novel two phases model-based strategy for leakage
detection. The two phases are: the identification of the district metering area
(DMA) and the pipe pre-localization into the identified DMA. The strategy is
based on detecting and pre-localizing the punctual leakage as anomaly with
respect to the normal working conditions. A further novelty is the fact that
the pre-localization phase returns the sequence of pipes to inspect, which
makes the strategy attractive for water utilities, whose aim is to identify the
anomaly at DMA level and, successively, to localize it with the minimum
inspection cost. Furthermore, a random database is useful to test the
performance of the strategy with respect to the configuration of DMAs and the
pressure metering system. Consequently, a novel strategy to design the location
of pressure meters is also proposed. It is demonstrated that the entire
strategy limits false positives during the DMA identification phase by using
the recently proposed index named Asset Management Support Indicator (AMSI).
AMSI is invariant with respect to the deterioration, i.e., it is sensitive to
its increase causing punctual leakage. The strategy is studied and discussed
using two real Apulian WDNs managed by Acquedotto Pugliese.

TL;DR: Proposes MVCS scheme for non-coherent over-the-air computation that exploits data sparsity using random projections and majority vote aggregation, achieving efficient recovery of high-dimensional sparse vector sums.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing non-coherent AirComp methods require more than d channel uses for d-dimensional data, but sparsity can be exploited for cheaper communication by transmitting lower-dimensional projections.

Method: Use random transforms to create lower-dimensional projections, communicate via majority vote AirComp scheme to estimate sign-aggregated projections, then apply 1-bit compressed sensing to recover the original high-dimensional aggregate.

Result: Proves MVCS estimates aggregated data vector with ℓ2-norm error ε in T=O(kn log(d)/ε²) channel uses, significantly improving over state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: MVCS enables efficient non-coherent AirComp for sparse data, with applications in histogram estimation and distributed machine learning, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: We consider the problem of non-coherent over-the-air computation (AirComp),
where $n$ devices carry high-dimensional data vectors
$\mathbf{x}_i\in\mathbb{R}^d$ of sparsity $\lVert\mathbf{x}_i\rVert_0\leq k$
whose sum has to be computed at a receiver. Previous results on non-coherent
AirComp require more than $d$ channel uses to compute functions of
$\mathbf{x}_i$, where the extra redundancy is used to combat non-coherent
signal aggregation. However, if the data vectors are sparse, sparsity can be
exploited to offer significantly cheaper communication. In this paper, we
propose to use random transforms to transmit lower-dimensional projections
$\mathbf{s}_i\in\mathbb{R}^T$ of the data vectors. These projected vectors are
communicated to the receiver using a majority vote (MV)-AirComp scheme, which
estimates the bit-vector corresponding to the signs of the aggregated
projections, i.e., $\mathbf{y} = \text{sign}(\sum_i\mathbf{s}_i)$. By
leveraging 1-bit compressed sensing (1bCS) at the receiver, the real-valued and
high-dimensional aggregate $\sum_i\mathbf{x}_i$ can be recovered from
$\mathbf{y}$. We prove analytically that the proposed MVCS scheme estimates the
aggregated data vector $\sum_i \mathbf{x}_i$ with $\ell_2$-norm error
$\epsilon$ in $T=\mathcal{O}(kn\log(d)/\epsilon^2)$ channel uses. Moreover, we
specify algorithms that leverage MVCS for histogram estimation and distributed
machine learning. Finally, we provide numerical evaluations that reveal the
advantage of MVCS compared to the state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: AWSPNet is a deep learning framework for radar target recognition and jamming suppression that achieves 90.45% accuracy at -6 dB SNR using dual-tree wavelet transforms, attention mechanisms, and prototypical networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digital radio frequency memory jammers create deceptive false targets that overwhelm radar systems, making robust discrimination between true targets and jamming signals crucial, especially in low SNR environments.

Method: Uses dual-tree complex wavelet transform for noise-robust feature extraction, attention mechanisms for feature refinement, supervised contrastive learning for limited data scenarios, and prototypical networks for few-shot learning classification.

Result: Achieves 90.45% accuracy at -6 dB SNR and effectively suppresses various jamming types when integrated with time-domain sliding window approach.

Conclusion: AWSPNet demonstrates strong potential for practical application in complex electromagnetic environments by simultaneously identifying and suppressing jamming signals with high accuracy in challenging conditions.

Abstract: The increasing of digital radio frequency memory based electronic
countermeasures poses a significant threat to the survivability and
effectiveness of radar systems. These jammers can generate a multitude of
deceptive false targets, overwhelming the radar's processing capabilities and
masking targets. Consequently, the ability to robustly discriminate between
true targets and complex jamming signals, especially in low signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) environments, is of importance. This paper introduces the
attention-based dual-tree wavelet scattering prototypical network (AWSPNet), a
deep learning framework designed for simultaneous radar target recognition and
jamming suppression. The core of AWSPNet is the encoder that leverages the
dual-tree complex wavelet transform to extract features that are inherently
robust to noise and signal translations. These features are further refined by
an attention mechanism and a pre-trained backbone network. To address the
challenge of limited labeled data and enhance generalization, we employ a
supervised contrastive learning strategy during the training phase. The
classification is performed by a prototypical network, which is particularly
effective in few-shot learning scenarios, enabling rapid adaptation to new
signal types. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through extensive
experiments. The results show that AWSPNet achieves 90.45\% accuracy at -6 dB
SNR. Furthermore, we provide a physical interpretation of the network's inner
workings through t-SNE visualizations, which analyze the feature separability
at different stages of the model. Finally, by integrating AWSPNet with a
time-domain sliding window approach, we present a complete algorithm capable of
not only identifying but also effectively suppressing various types of jamming,
thereby validating its potential for practical application in complex
electromagnetic environments.

*Anwar Ahmed Khan,Shama Siddiqui,Indrakshi Dey*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Comparison of FROG-MAC vs FPS-MAC for industrial wireless networks shows FROG-MAC outperforms in energy efficiency and delay due to its ability to interrupt lower priority transmissions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial automation requires efficient delay management due to high risks for equipment and human lives. Efficient MAC schemes are needed for timely transmission of critical data in heterogeneous industrial environments.

Method: Used Contiki simulation platform with single hop star topology to compare FROG-MAC (Fragmentation based MAC) against FPS-MAC (Fuzzy Priority Scheduling based MAC) for heterogeneous wireless networks.

Result: FROG-MAC demonstrated better performance than FPS-MAC in terms of both energy efficiency and delay.

Conclusion: FROG-MAC has potential to outperform FPS-MAC due to its inherent feature of interrupting ongoing lower priority transmission on the channel.

Abstract: Managing delay is one of the core requirements of industrial automation
applications due to the high risk associated for equipment and human lives.
Using efficient Media Access Control (MAC) schemes guarantees the timely
transmission of critical data, particularly in the industrial environments
where heterogeneous data is inherently expected. This paper compares the
performance of Fragmentation based MAC (FROG-MAC) against Fuzzy Priority
Scheduling based MAC (FPS-MAC), both of which have been designed to optimize
the performance of heterogenous wireless networks. Contiki has been used as a
simulation platform and a single hop star topology has been assumed to resemble
the industrial environment. It has been shown that FROG-MAC has the potential
to outperform FPS-MAC in terms of energy efficiency and delay both, due to its
inherent feature of interrupting ongoing lower priority transmission on the
channel.

*Shama Siddiqui,Anwar Ahmed Khan,Indrakshi Dey*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Comparison between high-level theoretical and detailed implementation simulations of ADP-MAC protocol shows significantly different performance trends for energy consumption and delay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the quality of performance evaluation for MAC protocols in WSNs by comparing high-level theoretical simulations with detailed implementation results before real-world deployment.

Method: Used MATLAB for high-level theoretical simulations and TinyOS for detailed implementation on Mica2 platform, evaluating ADP-MAC based on energy and delay metrics.

Result: High-level simulations showed decreasing energy consumption but increasing delay with longer polling intervals, while detailed implementation revealed both energy and delay increased with longer polling intervals.

Conclusion: The trends between high- and low-level simulations for ADP-MAC are significantly different due to lack of realistic assumptions in higher-level studies, highlighting the importance of detailed implementation testing.

Abstract: Simulation studies are conducted at different levels of details for assessing
the performance of Media Access Control (MAC) protocols in Wireless Sensor
Networks (WSN). In the present-day scenario where hundreds of MAC protocols
have been proposed, it is important to assess the quality of performance
evaluation being conducted for each of the proposed protocols. It therefore
becomes crucial to compare the results of high-level theoretical simulations
with the detailed implementation results before any network protocol could be
deployed for a real-world scenario. In this work, we present a comparison of
high-level theoretical and detailed implementation results for Adaptive and
Dynamic Polling-MAC (ADP-MAC). MATLAB has been used for conducting initial
theoretical simulations and TinyOS has been used to develop the detailed
implementation of protocol for Mica2 platform. Performance evaluation of
ADP-MAC using the two levels of simulation has been conducted based on energy
and delay. In the high-level implementation, energy consumption was found to be
decreasing whereas delay was found to be increasing for increasing channel
polling intervals. On the other hand, when detailed implementation was
developed, it was observed that both energy consumption and delay revealed an
increasing trend with the increasing polling intervals. Therefore, it has been
shown that the trends for high- and low-level simulations for ADP-MAC are
significantly different, due to the lack of realistic assumptions in the
higher-level study.

### [169] [mSQUID: Model-Based Leanred Modulo Recovery at Low Sampling Rates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18729)
*Yhonatan Kvich,Rotem Arie,Hana Hasan,Shaik Basheeruddin Shah,Yonina C. Eldar*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Proposes mSQUID, a model-based deep unfolding network for modulo sampling that combines classical compress sensing with learning, featuring a soft-quantization module to handle nonlinear distortion from folding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modulo sampling enables acquisition of signals with unlimited dynamic range without clipping, but introduces nonlinear distortion that makes recovery challenging under noise and quantization.

Method: Developed modulo soft-quantized unfolded iterative decoder (mSQUID) - a deep unfolding network with soft-quantization module that guides solutions toward discrete multiples of folding range in differentiable way.

Result: Achieves superior reconstruction performance at low sampling rates under additive Gaussian noise, handles challenging scenarios with signals of different amplitudes and disjoint frequency bands, and offers significantly reduced runtimes.

Conclusion: mSQUID enables effective signal recovery in modulo sampling systems, overcoming limitations of classical sampling approaches while being suitable for real-time, resource-limited systems.

Abstract: Modulo sampling enables acquisition of signals with unlimited dynamic range
by folding the input into a bounded interval prior to sampling, thus
eliminating the risk of signal clipping and preserving information without
requiring highresolution ADCs. While this enables low-cost hardware, the
nonlinear distortion introduced by folding presents recovery challenges,
particularly under noise and quantization. We propose a model-based deep
unfolding network tailored to this setting, combining the interpretability of
classical compress sensing (CS) solvers with the flexibility of learning. A key
innovation is a soft-quantization module that encodes the modulo prior by
guiding the solution toward discrete multiples of the folding range in a
differentiable and learnable way. Our method, modulo soft-quantized unfolded
iterative decoder (mSQUID), achieves superior reconstruction performance at low
sampling rates under additive Gaussian noise. We further demonstrate its
utility in a challenging case where signals with vastly different amplitudes
and disjoint frequency bands are acquired simultaneously and quantized. In this
scenario, classical sampling often struggles due to weak signal distortion or
strong signal clipping, while our approach is able to recover the input
signals. Our method also offers significantly reduced runtimes, making it
suitable for real-time, resource-limited systems.

*Kasun R. Wijewardhana,Animesh Yadav,Ming Zeng,Mohamed Elsayed,Octavia A. Dobre,Zhiguo Ding*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Wireless-fed pinching-antenna systems (Wi-PASS) overcome the deployment limitations of wire-fed PASS by using wireless feeding to energize waveguides, enabling extended coverage beyond base station vicinity with higher data rates than conventional fixed-antenna systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional waveguide-based pinching-antenna systems (PASS) suffer from deployment limitations due to wire-based feeding, confining them to areas near base stations and making them cost-ineffective for distant users.

Method: The proposed Wi-PASS employs wireless feeding to energize waveguides instead of wire-based feeding, allowing more flexible deployment beyond base station vicinity.

Result: Wi-PASS demonstrates higher data rates than conventional fixed-antenna systems and offers practical advantages in both indoor and outdoor use cases compared to PASS.

Conclusion: Wi-PASS provides a superior and feasible solution for extending millimeter-wave and terahertz coverage, with wireless feeding enabling more flexible and cost-effective deployment beyond base station constraints.

Abstract: Waveguide-based pinching-antenna systems (PASS) have recently emerged as a
promising solution to mitigate severe propagation losses in millimeter-wave and
terahertz bands by intelligently and flexibly establishing line-of-sight links.
However, their reliance on wire-based feeding confines deployment to areas near
the base station (BS), limiting installation flexibility and making them
cost-ineffective for serving distant users or regions. To overcome this
challenge, this article proposes wireless-fed pinchingantenna systems
(Wi-PASS), which employ wireless feeding to energize waveguides. Wi-PASS offer
a practical and cost-efficient means to extend coverage beyond the BS vicinity.
Several indoor and outdoor use cases demonstrate Wi-PASS advantages over PASS.
Numerical results further show that Wi-PASS deliver higher data rates than
conventional fixed-antenna systems, confirming the superior feasibility and
performance of Wi-PASS. Key future research directions are also discussed to
advance Wi-PASS deployment.

*Michael Fraiman,Paulina Hoyos,Tamir Bendory,Joe Kileel,Oscar Mickelin,Nir Sharon,Amit Singer*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper develops an efficient SO(3)-invariant PCA method for 3D volumetric data with unknown orientations, avoiding the computational cost of explicit data augmentation by exploiting algebraic structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PCA is challenging for 3D data with arbitrary orientations (common in structural biology) because naive approaches require augmenting datasets with rotated copies, which incurs prohibitive computational costs.

Method: The authors extend PCA to 3D volumetric datasets by developing an efficient framework for SO(3)-invariant PCA that implicitly accounts for all rotations without explicit data augmentation, exploiting underlying algebraic structure.

Result: The method reduces computational complexity by requiring only the square root of the total number of covariance entries. Validation on real-world molecular datasets demonstrates its effectiveness.

Conclusion: This approach opens up new possibilities for large-scale, high-dimensional reconstruction problems in structural biology and related fields.

Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA) is a fundamental technique for
dimensionality reduction and denoising; however, its application to
three-dimensional data with arbitrary orientations -- common in structural
biology -- presents significant challenges. A naive approach requires
augmenting the dataset with many rotated copies of each sample, incurring
prohibitive computational costs. In this paper, we extend PCA to 3D volumetric
datasets with unknown orientations by developing an efficient and principled
framework for SO(3)-invariant PCA that implicitly accounts for all rotations
without explicit data augmentation. By exploiting underlying algebraic
structure, we demonstrate that the computation involves only the square root of
the total number of covariance entries, resulting in a substantial reduction in
complexity. We validate the method on real-world molecular datasets,
demonstrating its effectiveness and opening up new possibilities for
large-scale, high-dimensional reconstruction problems.

Result: On six standard benchmarks, PRISM achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance with strong MSE and MAE gains.

Conclusion: The model's robustness is explained through proven contraction of induced horizon dynamics under mild conditions and derived Lipschitz bounds for graph blocks.

Abstract: Long-horizon multivariate time-series forecasting is challenging because

prove contraction of the induced horizon dynamics under mild conditions and
derive Lipschitz bounds for graph blocks, explaining the model's robustness. On

*Zongze Wu,Yani Guo,Churong Liang,Runnan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRETEL addresses the semantic-functional gap in tool retrieval by using execution-based validation instead of just semantic similarity, improving tool selection reliability for agent systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tool retrieval methods rely on semantic similarity but often retrieve tools that are textually relevant but functionally inoperative due to parameter mismatches, authentication failures, and execution constraints.

Method: GRETEL implements an agentic workflow with sandboxed plan-execute-evaluate cycles that process semantically retrieved candidates and generate execution-grounded evidence to identify functional tools.

Result: On ToolBench benchmark, GRETEL achieved substantial improvements: Pass Rate (at 10) increased from 0.690 to 0.826, Recall (at 10) improved from 0.841 to 0.867, and NDCG (at 10) rose from 0.807 to 0.857.

Conclusion: Execution-based validation provides a more reliable foundation for tool selection than semantic similarity alone, enabling more robust agent performance in real-world applications.

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances in Large Language Model capabilities, tool
retrieval for agent-based systems remains fundamentally limited by reliance on
semantic similarity, which fails to capture functional viability. Current
methods often retrieve textually relevant but functionally inoperative tools
due to parameter mismatches, authentication failures, and execution
constraints--a phenomenon we term the semantic-functional gap. We introduce
GRETEL, to address this gap through systematic empirical validation. GRETEL
implements an agentic workflow that processes semantically retrieved candidates
through sandboxed plan-execute-evaluate cycles, generating execution-grounded
evidence to distinguish truly functional tools from merely descriptive matches.
Our comprehensive evaluation on the ToolBench benchmark demonstrates
substantial improvements across all metrics: Pass Rate (at 10) increases from
0.690 to 0.826, Recall (at 10) improves from 0.841 to 0.867, and NDCG (at 10)
rises from 0.807 to 0.857.. These results establish that execution-based
validation provides a more reliable foundation for tool selection than semantic
similarity alone, enabling more robust agent performance in real-world
applications.

TL;DR: CARLE is a hybrid AI framework combining deep learning (Res-CNN, Res-LSTM with attention) and shallow learning (Random Forest) for robust Remaining Useful Life prediction of bearings under changing operating conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RUL estimation methods often lack generalizability and robustness under changing operating conditions, limiting their practical application in Prognostic Health Management systems.

Method: Hybrid framework using Res-CNN and Res-LSTM blocks with multi-head attention and residual connections for spatial-temporal pattern extraction, combined with Random Forest Regressor for stable prediction. Includes preprocessing with Gaussian filtering and Continuous Wavelet Transform.

Result: CARLE outperforms state-of-the-art methods on XJTU-SY and PRONOSTIA datasets, particularly under dynamic conditions, and demonstrates strong robustness in noise and cross-domain experiments.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach effectively addresses RUL prediction challenges, providing accurate, robust, and interpretable results through model analysis with LIME and SHAP.

Abstract: Prognostic Health Management (PHM) systems monitor and predict equipment
health. A key task is Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation, which predicts
how long a component, such as a rolling element bearing, will operate before
failure. Many RUL methods exist but often lack generalizability and robustness
under changing operating conditions. This paper introduces CARLE, a hybrid AI
framework that combines deep and shallow learning to address these challenges.
CARLE uses Res-CNN and Res-LSTM blocks with multi-head attention and residual
connections to capture spatial and temporal degradation patterns, and a Random
Forest Regressor (RFR) for stable, accurate RUL prediction. A compact
preprocessing pipeline applies Gaussian filtering for noise reduction and
Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) for time-frequency feature extraction. We
evaluate CARLE on the XJTU-SY and PRONOSTIA bearing datasets. Ablation studies
measure each component's contribution, while noise and cross-domain experiments
test robustness and generalization. Comparative results show CARLE outperforms
several state-of-the-art methods, especially under dynamic conditions. Finally,
we analyze model interpretability with LIME and SHAP to assess transparency and
trustworthiness.

Method: Proposes MIN-Merging, a router-based framework that selectively merges the most important neurons to reduce parameter conflicts during model merging.

Result: Extensive experiments on CV and NLP benchmarks show consistent gains on in-domain tasks while retaining generalization ability on out-of-domain tasks.

Conclusion: MIN-Merging is an effective practical solution to the parameter conflict problem in model merging, demonstrating improved performance without sacrificing generalization.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to a surge of open-source models

TL;DR: A federated unlearning approach for LLMs that handles continuous, heterogeneous unlearning requests while preserving privacy and maintaining model utility through task-specific adapter learning and hierarchical merging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy and security concerns in LLM applications by removing undesirable knowledge, while handling practical challenges of continuous heterogeneous unlearning needs and decentralized sensitive data with asymmetric access.

Method: Proposes federated unlearning that decouples unlearning and retention via task-specific adapter learning, and employs hierarchical merging strategy to mitigate conflicting objectives and enable robust unlearning updates.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on WMDP, MUSE, and TOFU benchmarks showed effective handling of heterogeneous unlearning requests while maintaining strong LLM utility compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed federated unlearning approach provides a scalable and privacy-preserving solution for LLMs that effectively addresses inter-domain and intra-domain interference while balancing forgetting and retention performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into real-world
applications, raising concerns about privacy, security and the need to remove
undesirable knowledge. Machine Unlearning has emerged as a promising solution,
yet faces two key challenges: (1) practical unlearning needs are often
continuous and heterogeneous, and (2) they involve decentralized, sensitive
data with asymmetric access. These factors result in inter-domain and
intra-domain interference, which further amplifies the dilemma of unbalanced
forgetting and retaining performance. In response, we propose a federated
unlearning approach for LLMs that is scalable and privacy preserving. Our
method decouples unlearning and retention via task-specific adapter learning
and employs a hierarchical merging strategy to mitigate conflicting objectives
and enables robust, adaptable unlearning updates. Comprehensive experiments on
benchmarks of WMDP, MUSE, and TOFU showed that our approach effectively handles
heterogeneous unlearning requests while maintaining strong LLM utility compared
with baseline methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified benchmark for evaluating attention mechanisms in long-context LLM training, addressing gaps in systematic comparison of kernel-level optimizations and context parallel strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard attention in Transformers has quadratic computation/memory costs, limiting long-context training. Prior work lacks systematic evaluation - operator comparisons are incomplete and context parallel strategies are framework-specific with unclear performance analysis.

Method: Proposed unified benchmark integrating representative attention kernels and context parallel mechanisms with modular interface. Evaluates methods along attention mask patterns and sequence length/distributed scale dimensions.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on up to 96 GPUs enable reproducible comparisons, highlight method-specific trade-offs, and provide practical guidance for attention mechanism design and deployment.

Conclusion: The benchmark addresses evaluation gaps in long-context LLM training, offering systematic comparison framework for attention optimization methods across different contexts and scales.

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
success, yet their standard attention mechanism incurs quadratic computation
and memory costs with respect to sequence length, posing a major bottleneck for
long-context training. Prior work tackles this challenge along two directions:
(1) kernel-level optimizations, which accelerate dense and sparse attention
operators; and (2) module-level strategies, often referred to as distributed
attention or context parallel training, which scale attention across multiple
devices. However, systematic evaluation still remains limited: operator-level
comparisons are often incomplete, while context parallel strategies are
typically framework-specific, with unclear performance analysis across
contexts. To address these gaps, we propose a unified benchmark that integrates
representative attention kernels and context parallel mechanisms with a modular
and extensible interface for evaluation. The benchmark evaluates methods along
two critical dimensions: (1) attention mask patterns, which strongly affect
efficiency, scalability, and usability, and (2) sequence length and distributed
scale, which determine performance under extreme long-context training. Through
comprehensive experiments on the cluster of up to 96 GPUs, our benchmark
enables reproducible comparisons, highlights method-specific trade-offs, and
provides practical guidance for designing and deploying attention mechanisms in
long-context LLM training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: L-MoE is a novel framework that combines Mixture of Experts (MoE) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), replacing dense experts with task-specialized LoRA adapters and using a differentiable gating network to dynamically compose them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a parameter-efficient MoE model that maintains computational efficiency while enabling dynamic skill composition and end-to-end trainability, unifying the scaling benefits of MoE with the parameter efficiency of LoRA.

Method: Redefines MoE experts as collections of task-specialized LoRA adapters, with a lightweight gating network that computes weighted averages of adapter parameters for each input token. The composition is fully differentiable, enabling joint optimization of experts and routing.

Result: A highly parameter-efficient MoE model that is modular, allows dynamic skill composition, and is trainable end-to-end through a differentiable routing mechanism.

Conclusion: L-MoE provides a new path toward building more efficient, scalable, and specialized language models by unifying MoE and LoRA paradigms into an end-to-end trainable framework.

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture enables the scaling of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to trillions of parameters by activating a sparse subset
of weights for each input, maintaining constant computational cost during
inference. Concurrently, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a dominant
technique for parameter-efficiently fine-tuning LLMs on specialized tasks. In
this work, we unify these two paradigms into a novel, end-to-end trainable
framework named L-MoE: a Lightweight Mixture of LoRA Experts. L-MoE redefines
MoE experts not as dense feed-forward networks, but as a collection of
task-specialized, low-rank adapters. A lightweight gating network, trained
jointly with the experts, learns to dynamically compose these LoRA adapters by
computing a weighted average of their parameters for each input token. This
composition is fully differentiable, allowing gradients from a standard
auto-regressive language modeling objective to flow back through the entire
architecture, simultaneously refining both the expert adapters and the routing
strategy. This approach creates a highly parameter-efficient MoE model that is
modular by design, allows for dynamic skill composition, and is trainable from
end-to-end. We present the formal mathematical framework for L-MoE, detailing
the differentiable routing mechanism and the joint optimization objective,
thereby providing a new path toward building more efficient, scalable, and
specialized language models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Using LLMs to automatically generate optimization algorithms for auto-tuning, achieving performance improvements over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional auto-tuning methods struggle with vast parameter spaces and no single optimizer works best across all tasks. LLMs offer potential to generate specialized optimizers tailored to specific problems.

Method: Framework that prompts LLMs with problem descriptions and search-space characteristics to produce specialized optimization strategies, which are iteratively refined.

Result: LLM-generated optimizers achieved average performance improvements of 30.7% and 14.6% when provided with application- and search space-specific information, with best algorithms showing 72.4% improvement over state-of-the-art optimizers.

Conclusion: LLM-generated optimization algorithms can rival and often outperform human-designed algorithms, demonstrating the viability of using LLMs for automatic optimizer generation in auto-tuning applications.

Abstract: Automatic performance tuning (auto-tuning) is essential for optimizing
high-performance applications, where vast and irregular parameter spaces make
manual exploration infeasible. Traditionally, auto-tuning relies on
well-established optimization algorithms such as evolutionary algorithms,
annealing methods, or surrogate model-based optimizers to efficiently find
near-optimal configurations. However, designing effective optimizers remains
challenging, as no single method performs best across all tuning tasks.
  In this work, we explore a new paradigm: using large language models (LLMs)
to automatically generate optimization algorithms tailored to auto-tuning
problems. We introduce a framework that prompts LLMs with problem descriptions
and search-space characteristics results to produce specialized optimization
strategies, which are iteratively examined and improved.
  These generated algorithms are evaluated on four real-world auto-tuning
applications across six hardware platforms and compared against the
state-of-the-art in optimization algorithms of two contemporary auto-tuning
frameworks. The evaluation demonstrates that providing additional application-
and search space-specific information in the generation stage results in an
average performance improvement of 30.7\% and 14.6\%, respectively. In
addition, our results show that LLM-generated optimizers can rival, and in
various cases outperform, existing human-designed algorithms, with our
best-performing generated optimization algorithms achieving, on average, 72.4\%

TL;DR: SBVFL reduces communication by ~99% in Vertical Federated Learning while maintaining accuracy and robustness, enabling practical privacy-preserving VFL across sensitive domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard VFL requires vast communications during training, compromising privacy, security, and energy efficiency, making model training sometimes unfeasible.

Method: Sherpa.ai Blind Vertical Federated Learning (SBVFL) uses a distributed training mechanism that decouples the majority of node updates from the server to dramatically reduce node-server communication.

Result: SBVFL reduces communication by approximately 99% compared to standard VFL while maintaining accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: SBVFL enables practical, privacy-preserving VFL across sensitive domains including healthcare, finance, manufacturing, aerospace, cybersecurity, and defense industry.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative decentralized training across
multiple parties (nodes) while keeping raw data private. There are two main
paradigms in FL: Horizontal FL (HFL), where all participant nodes share the
same feature space but hold different samples, and Vertical FL (VFL), where
participants hold complementary features for the same samples. While HFL is
widely adopted, VFL is employed in domains where nodes hold complementary
features about the same samples. Still, VFL presents a significant limitation:
the vast number of communications required during training. This compromises
privacy and security, and can lead to high energy consumption, and in some
cases, make model training unfeasible due to the high number of communications.
  In this paper, we introduce Sherpa.ai Blind Vertical Federated Learning
(SBVFL), a novel paradigm that leverages a distributed training mechanism
enhanced for privacy and security. Decoupling the vast majority of node updates
from the server dramatically reduces node-server communication. Experiments
show that SBVFL reduces communication by ~99% compared to standard VFL while
maintaining accuracy and robustness. Therefore, SBVFL enables practical,
privacy-preserving VFL across sensitive domains, including healthcare, finance,
manufacturing, aerospace, cybersecurity, and the defense industry.

*Hassan Gharoun,Mohammad Sadegh Khorshidi,Kasra Ranjbarigderi,Fang Chen,Amir H. Gandomi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A post-hoc calibration framework that uses prediction reliability assessment to improve both calibration quality and uncertainty-aware decision-making through instance-level adaptive calibration strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing calibration methods apply global transformations uniformly, ignoring the heterogeneous reliability of individual predictions, and the relationship between improved calibration and effective uncertainty-aware decision-making remains unexplored.

Method: Uses proximity-based conformal prediction to stratify samples into correct/incorrect groups based on semantic similarity, then applies dual calibration: standard isotonic regression for correct predictions and underconfidence-regularized isotonic regression for incorrect predictions to reduce confidence toward uniform distributions.

Result: Achieves lower confidently incorrect predictions and competitive Expected Calibration Error compared to isotonic and focal-loss baselines on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with BiT and CoAtNet backbones.

Conclusion: Bridges calibration and uncertainty quantification through instance-level adaptivity, offering a practical post-hoc solution that improves both probability alignment and uncertainty-aware decision-making without model retraining.

Abstract: Despite extensive research on neural network calibration, existing methods
typically apply global transformations that treat all predictions uniformly,
overlooking the heterogeneous reliability of individual predictions.
Furthermore, the relationship between improved calibration and effective
uncertainty-aware decision-making remains largely unexplored. This paper
presents a post-hoc calibration framework that leverages prediction reliability
assessment to jointly enhance calibration quality and uncertainty-aware
decision-making. The framework employs proximity-based conformal prediction to
stratify calibration samples into putatively correct and putatively incorrect
groups based on semantic similarity in feature space. A dual calibration
strategy is then applied: standard isotonic regression calibrated confidence in
putatively correct predictions, while underconfidence-regularized isotonic
regression reduces confidence toward uniform distributions for putatively
incorrect predictions, facilitating their identification for further
investigations. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted using calibration
metrics, uncertainty-aware performance measures, and empirical conformal
coverage. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with BiT and CoAtNet backbones
show that the proposed method achieves lower confidently incorrect predictions,
and competitive Expected Calibration Error compared with isotonic and
focal-loss baselines. This work bridges calibration and uncertainty
quantification through instance-level adaptivity, offering a practical post-hoc
solution that requires no model retraining while improving both probability
alignment and uncertainty-aware decision-making.

### [185] [Data Unlearning Beyond Uniform Forgetting via Diffusion Time and Frequency Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17917)
*Jinseong Park,Mijung Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a time-frequency selective approach for data unlearning in diffusion models that improves quality and completeness of forgetting by focusing on specific time-frequency ranges rather than treating all diffusion steps equally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data unlearning in diffusion models is underexplored and suffers from quality degradation or incomplete forgetting. Existing methods treat all diffusion time steps equally, leading to poor generation quality.

Method: Time-frequency selective approach that focuses on specific time-frequency ranges during training, applied to gradient-based and preference optimization objectives for both image-level and text-to-image tasks.

Result: Achieves samples with higher aesthetic quality and lower noise compared to existing methods, with improved unlearning performance across diverse settings.

Conclusion: Establishes clearer understanding of data unlearning challenges in diffusion models and provides practical strategies to improve both evaluation and unlearning performance.

Abstract: Data unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training samples
from a trained model without requiring full retraining. Unlike concept
unlearning, data unlearning in diffusion models remains underexplored and often
suffers from quality degradation or incomplete forgetting. To address this, we
first observe that most existing methods attempt to unlearn the samples at all
diffusion time steps equally, leading to poor-quality generation. We argue that
forgetting occurs disproportionately across time and frequency, depending on
the model and scenarios. By selectively focusing on specific time-frequency
ranges during training, we achieve samples with higher aesthetic quality and
lower noise. We validate this improvement by applying our time-frequency
selective approach to diverse settings, including gradient-based and preference
optimization objectives, as well as both image-level and text-to-image tasks.
Finally, to evaluate both deletion and quality of unlearned data samples, we
propose a simple normalized version of SSCD. Together, our analysis and methods
establish a clearer understanding of the unique challenges in data unlearning
for diffusion models, providing practical strategies to improve both evaluation
and unlearning performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: COMPASS introduces a novel test-time reward mechanism for reinforcement learning on unlabeled data, combining dual-calibration answer reward and decisive path reward to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities without external supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods for LLMs face scalability bottlenecks due to reliance on human-curated preference data or labeled datasets for reward modeling. The paper aims to enable autonomous learning from continuous experience streams without ground-truth supervision.

Method: COMPASS integrates two components: DCAR (Dual-Calibration Answer Reward) stabilizes training through confidence and credibility calibration for trustworthy pseudo-labels, and DPR (Decisive Path Reward) directly optimizes reasoning process quality beyond outcome supervision.

Result: Extensive experiments show COMPASS achieves significant and consistent performance gains across diverse reasoning tasks and model architectures, demonstrating effective autonomous learning from continuous experience.

Conclusion: COMPASS advances a more scalable direction for LLMs to learn from continuous experience by systematically enhancing analytical capabilities through joint reinforcement of trustworthy consensus answers and highly decisive reasoning chains.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for advancing
Large Language Models (LLMs), achieving remarkable performance in complex
reasoning domains such as mathematics and code generation. However, current RL
methods face a fundamental scalability bottleneck due to their heavy reliance
on human-curated preference data or labeled datasets for reward modeling. To
overcome this limitation, we explore RL on unlabeled data where models learn
autonomously from continuous experience streams. The core challenge in this
setting lies in reliable reward estimation without ground-truth supervision.
Existing approaches like Test-Time RL address this through self-consistent
consensus, but risk reinforcing incorrect pseudo-labels derived from majority
voting. We introduce COMPASS (Composite Path and Answer Self-Scoring), a novel
test-time reward mechanism that operates without external supervision. COMPASS
integrates two complementary components: the Dual-Calibration Answer Reward
(DCAR), which stabilizes training by establishing trustworthy pseudo-labels
through confidence and credibility calibration, and the Decisive Path Reward
(DPR), which directly optimizes the reasoning process quality beyond mere
outcome supervision. By jointly reinforcing trustworthy consensus answers and
highly decisive reasoning chains, the COMPASS systematically enhances the
model's analytical capabilities. Extensive experiments show that COMPASS
achieves significant and consistent performance gains across diverse reasoning
tasks and model architectures, advancing a more scalable direction for LLMs to
learn from continuous experience.

*He Du,Bowen Li,Aijun Yang,Siyang He,Qipeng Guo,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an evolutionary, task-agnostic framework for synthesizing verifiable data that improves language model training across math, coding, and agentic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for creating verifiable data suffer from hallucination-prone generation and weak verification artifacts that don't effectively distinguish strong from weak solutions, lacking a universal evaluator of verifiability.

Method: An evolutionary framework that jointly synthesizes problems, diverse solutions, and verification artifacts from minimal seed supervision, using a consistency-based evaluator that enforces agreement between human-annotated and strategy-induced checks.

Result: Training with the synthesized data yields significant improvements on both LiveCodeBench and AgentBench-OS tasks, demonstrating robust generalization across domains.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully upgrades filtering into principled synthesis, reliably producing coherent verifiable training instances without domain-specific rules.

Abstract: Reliable verifiable data has become a key driver of capability gains in
modern language models, enabling stable reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards and effective distillation that transfers competence across math,
coding, and agentic tasks. Yet constructing generalizable synthetic verifiable
data remains difficult due to hallucination-prone generation, and weak or
trivial verification artifacts that fail to separate strong from weak
solutions. Existing approaches often rely on task-specific heuristics or
post-hoc filters that do not transfer across domains and lack a principled,
universal evaluator of verifiability. In this work, we introduce an
evolutionary, task-agnostic, strategy-guided, executably-checkable data
synthesis framework that, from minimal seed supervision, jointly synthesizes
problems, diverse candidate solutions, and verification artifacts, and
iteratively discovers strategies via a consistency-based evaluator that
enforces agreement between human-annotated and strategy-induced checks. This
pipeline upgrades filtering into principled synthesis: it reliably assembles
coherent, verifiable training instances and generalizes without domain-specific
rules. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach
under both RLVR and model distillation training paradigms. The results show
that training with our synthesized data yields significant improvements on both
the LiveCodeBench and AgentBench-OS tasks, highlighting the robust
generalization of our framework.

TL;DR: Param-CPD detects regime shifts in chaotic systems by first inferring governing parameters using neural posterior estimation, then applying changepoint detection to parameter trajectories, outperforming observation-space methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting regime shifts in chaotic time series is challenging because observation signals are entangled with intrinsic variability, making direct detection difficult.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Amortized Bayesian inference of governing parameters using neural posterior estimator trained by simulation-based inference, 2) Apply standard changepoint detection to resulting parameter trajectory.

Result: On Lorenz-63 with piecewise-constant parameters, Param-CPD improves F1 score, reduces localization error, and lowers false positives compared to observation-space baselines. Shows robustness across tolerance, window length, and noise levels.

Conclusion: Operating in physically interpretable parameter space enables accurate and interpretable changepoint detection in nonlinear dynamical systems.

Abstract: Detecting regime shifts in chaotic time series is hard because
observation-space signals are entangled with intrinsic variability. We propose
Parameter--Space Changepoint Detection (Param--CPD), a two--stage framework
that first amortizes Bayesian inference of governing parameters with a neural
posterior estimator trained by simulation-based inference, and then applies a
standard CPD algorithm to the resulting parameter trajectory. On Lorenz--63
with piecewise-constant parameters, Param--CPD improves F1, reduces
localization error, and lowers false positives compared to observation--space
baselines. We further verify identifiability and calibration of the inferred
posteriors on stationary trajectories, explaining why parameter space offers a
cleaner detection signal. Robustness analyses over tolerance, window length,
and noise indicate consistent gains. Our results show that operating in a
physically interpretable parameter space enables accurate and interpretable
changepoint detection in nonlinear dynamical systems.

*Jaihoon Kim,Rajarshi Saha,Minhyuk Sung,Youngsuk Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transition Matching (TM) outperforms Flow Matching (FM) in generative models when target distributions have well-separated modes and non-negligible variances, due to TM's stochastic updates preserving target covariance that FM underestimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when and why Transition Matching (TM) achieves higher quality with fewer sampling steps than Flow Matching (FM), which underpins many state-of-the-art generative models.

Method: Theoretical analysis comparing TM and FM convergence rates and KL divergence for unimodal Gaussian distributions and Gaussian mixtures, validated with controlled experiments on Gaussian distributions and real-world image/video generation applications.

Result: TM attains strictly lower KL divergence than FM for finite steps in unimodal Gaussian settings, achieves faster convergence under fixed compute budget, and outperforms FM when target modes are well-separated with non-negligible variances.

Conclusion: TM outperforms FM when target distributions have well-separated modes and non-negligible variances, but the advantage diminishes as target variance approaches zero where TM updates converge to FM updates.

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) underpins many state-of-the-art generative models, yet
recent results indicate that Transition Matching (TM) can achieve higher
quality with fewer sampling steps. This work answers the question of when and
why TM outperforms FM. First, when the target is a unimodal Gaussian
distribution, we prove that TM attains strictly lower KL divergence than FM for
finite number of steps. The improvement arises from stochastic difference
latent updates in TM, which preserve target covariance that deterministic FM
underestimates. We then characterize convergence rates, showing that TM
achieves faster convergence than FM under a fixed compute budget, establishing
its advantage in the unimodal Gaussian setting. Second, we extend the analysis
to Gaussian mixtures and identify local-unimodality regimes in which the
sampling dynamics approximate the unimodal case, where TM can outperform FM.
The approximation error decreases as the minimal distance between component
means increases, highlighting that TM is favored when the modes are well
separated. However, when the target variance approaches zero, each TM update
converges to the FM update, and the performance advantage of TM diminishes. In
summary, we show that TM outperforms FM when the target distribution has
well-separated modes and non-negligible variances. We validate our theoretical
results with controlled experiments on Gaussian distributions, and extend the
comparison to real-world applications in image and video generation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A-DATSC is a novel deep subspace clustering model for multivariate spatiotemporal data that combines a U-Net-inspired generator with a quality-verifying discriminator, using attention mechanisms to capture both local and global dependencies while handling 4D data effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep subspace clustering methods have limitations: they use shallow autoencoders, ignore clustering errors, neglect local structure, fail to model long-range dependencies and positional information, and rarely handle 4D spatiotemporal data.

Method: Proposes A-DATSC with a deep subspace clustering generator inspired by U-Net using stacked TimeDistributed ConvLSTM2D layers, and a graph attention transformer self-expressive network to capture local spatial relationships, global dependencies, and short/long-range correlations.

Result: Experiments on three real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets show that A-DATSC achieves substantially superior clustering performance compared to state-of-the-art deep subspace clustering models.

Conclusion: A-DATSC effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods and demonstrates superior performance in clustering complex multivariate spatiotemporal data with temporal dependencies across multiple nonlinear manifolds.

Abstract: Deep subspace clustering models are vital for applications such as snowmelt
detection, sea ice tracking, crop health monitoring, infectious disease
modeling, network load prediction, and land-use planning, where multivariate
spatiotemporal data exhibit complex temporal dependencies and reside on
multiple nonlinear manifolds beyond the capability of traditional clustering
methods. These models project data into a latent space where samples lie in
linear subspaces and exploit the self-expressiveness property to uncover
intrinsic relationships. Despite their success, existing methods face major
limitations: they use shallow autoencoders that ignore clustering errors,
emphasize global features while neglecting local structure, fail to model
long-range dependencies and positional information, and are rarely applied to
4D spatiotemporal data. To address these issues, we propose A-DATSC
(Attention-Guided Deep Adversarial Temporal Subspace Clustering), a model
combining a deep subspace clustering generator and a quality-verifying
discriminator. The generator, inspired by U-Net, preserves spatial and temporal
integrity through stacked TimeDistributed ConvLSTM2D layers, reducing
parameters and enhancing generalization. A graph attention transformer based
self-expressive network captures local spatial relationships, global
dependencies, and both short- and long-range correlations. Experiments on three
real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets show that A-DATSC achieves
substantially superior clustering performance compared to state-of-the-art deep
subspace clustering models.

Conclusion: Deep learning shows promise for neural activity forecasting, pointing toward future control applications and new avenues for probing neural temporal structure.

Abstract: Neural activity forecasting is central to understanding neural systems and
enabling closed-loop control. While deep learning has recently advanced the
state-of-the-art in the time series forecasting literature, its application to
neural activity forecasting remains limited. To bridge this gap, we
systematically evaluated eight probabilistic deep learning models, including

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural operators fail in real-world systems where sensing and prediction occur on distinct physical manifolds and over long timescales, requiring dense input-output fields and short temporal contexts.

Method: STONe directly infers high-altitude radiation dose fields from sparse ground-based neutron measurements by learning a nonlinear operator between sensor and target manifolds that remains stable without iterative recurrence.

Result: Trained on 23 years of global neutron data, STONe achieves accurate 180-day forecasts with millisecond inference latency, demonstrating generalization beyond shared-domain settings.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a general principle for cross-domain operator inference, enabling real-time prediction of complex spatiotemporal fields in physics, climate, and energy systems without requiring domain alignment or autoregressive propagation.

Abstract: Forecasting unobservable physical quantities from sparse, cross-domain sensor
data is a central unsolved problem in scientific machine learning. Existing
neural operators and large-scale forecasters rely on dense, co-located
input-output fields and short temporal contexts, assumptions that fail in
real-world systems where sensing and prediction occur on distinct physical
manifolds and over long timescales. We introduce the Spatio-Temporal Operator
Network (STONe), a non-autoregressive neural operator that learns a stable
functional mapping between heterogeneous domains. By directly inferring
high-altitude radiation dose fields from sparse ground-based neutron
measurements, STONe demonstrates that operator learning can generalize beyond
shared-domain settings. It defines a nonlinear operator between sensor and
target manifolds that remains stable over long forecasting horizons without
iterative recurrence. This challenges the conventional view that operator
learning requires domain alignment or autoregressive propagation. Trained on 23
years of global neutron data, STONe achieves accurate 180-day forecasts with
millisecond inference latency. The framework establishes a general principle
for cross-domain operator inference, enabling real-time prediction of complex
spatiotemporal fields in physics, climate, and energy systems.

TL;DR: ACIA is a novel measure-theoretic framework for anti-causal representation learning that uses a two-level design to capture label-to-observation generation and learn stable causal patterns across environments, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal representation learning in anti-causal settings (where labels cause features) presents unique challenges that require specialized approaches beyond existing methods.

Method: ACIA employs a two-level design with low-level representations capturing label-to-observation generation and high-level representations learning stable causal patterns. It uses interventional kernels to handle perfect and imperfect interventions without explicit causal structures.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world medical datasets show ACIA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and invariance metrics.

Conclusion: ACIA provides theoretical guarantees for out-of-distribution generalization with tight performance bounds, confirming its efficacy for robust anti-causal learning.

Abstract: Causal representation learning in the anti-causal setting (labels cause
features rather than the reverse) presents unique challenges requiring
specialized approaches. We propose Anti-Causal Invariant Abstractions (ACIA), a
novel measure-theoretic framework for anti-causal representation learning. ACIA
employs a two-level design, low-level representations capture how labels
generate observations, while high-level representations learn stable causal
patterns across environment-specific variations. ACIA addresses key limitations
of existing approaches by accommodating prefect and imperfect interventions
through interventional kernels, eliminating dependency on explicit causal
structures, handling high-dimensional data effectively, and providing
theoretical guarantees for out-of-distribution generalization. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world medical datasets demonstrate that ACIA consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and invariance metrics.
Furthermore, our theoretical results establish tight bounds on performance gaps
between training and unseen environments, confirming the efficacy of our
approach for robust anti-causal learning.

*Jiajun Fan,Tong Wei,Chaoran Cheng,Yuxin Chen,Ge Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADRPO is an adaptive divergence regularization method for RL fine-tuning of generative models that automatically adjusts regularization strength based on advantage estimates, enabling better balance between exploration and exploitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches use fixed divergence regularization that creates a dilemma: strong regularization preserves model capabilities but limits reward optimization, while weak regularization enables alignment but risks instability or reward hacking.

Method: ADRPO automatically adjusts regularization strength based on advantage estimates - reducing regularization for high-value samples while applying stronger regularization to poor samples, using Wasserstein-2 regularization for flow matching generative models and KL-regularized fine-tuning for LLMs.

Result: Achieved remarkable results on text-to-image generation with 2B parameter SD3 model surpassing larger 4.8B and 12B models in attribute binding, semantic consistency, and compositional control. In LLM fine-tuning, demonstrated emergent ability to escape local optima, and in multi-modal audio reasoning, enabled 7B model to outperform commercial models like Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4o Audio.

Conclusion: ADRPO offers an effective plug-and-play solution to the exploration-exploitation challenge across diverse generative architectures and modalities, outperforming both offline methods like DPO and online methods with fixed regularization.

Abstract: Balancing exploration and exploitation during reinforcement learning
fine-tuning of generative models presents a critical challenge, as existing
approaches rely on fixed divergence regularization that creates an inherent
dilemma: strong regularization preserves model capabilities but limits reward
optimization, while weak regularization enables greater alignment but risks
instability or reward hacking. We introduce Adaptive Divergence Regularized
Policy Optimization (ADRPO), which automatically adjusts regularization
strength based on advantage estimates-reducing regularization for high-value
samples while applying stronger regularization to poor samples, enabling
policies to navigate between exploration and aggressive exploitation according
to data quality. Our implementation with Wasserstein-2 regularization for flow
matching generative models achieves remarkable results on text-to-image
generation, achieving better semantic alignment and diversity than offline
methods like DPO and online methods with fixed regularization like ORW-CFM-W2.
ADRPO enables a 2B parameter SD3 model to surpass much larger models with 4.8B
and 12B parameters in attribute binding, semantic consistency, artistic style
transfer, and compositional control while maintaining generation diversity.
ADRPO generalizes to KL-regularized fine-tuning of both text-only LLMs and
multi-modal reasoning models, enhancing existing online RL methods like GRPO.
In LLM fine-tuning, ADRPO demonstrates an emergent ability to escape local
optima through active exploration, while in multi-modal audio reasoning, it
outperforms GRPO through superior step-by-step reasoning, enabling a 7B model
to outperform substantially larger commercial models including Gemini 2.5 Pro
and GPT-4o Audio, offering an effective plug-and-play solution to the
exploration-exploitation challenge across diverse generative architectures and
modalities.

TL;DR: SPACeR is a framework that combines pretrained tokenized motion models with self-play RL to create fast, scalable, and human-like autonomous vehicle policies, achieving competitive performance while being significantly more efficient than large generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for autonomous vehicle simulation either use computationally expensive imitation learning models that struggle in reactive scenarios, or self-play RL that often diverges from human norms. There's a need for methods that are both human-like and scalable.

Method: SPACeR uses a pretrained tokenized autoregressive motion model as a centralized reference policy to guide decentralized self-play RL, providing likelihood rewards and KL divergence to anchor policies to human driving distribution while maintaining RL scalability.

Result: The method achieves competitive performance on Waymo Sim Agents Challenge while being 10x faster at inference and 50x smaller in parameter size than large generative models. It also enables effective closed-loop ego planning evaluation.

Conclusion: SPACeR establishes a new paradigm for testing autonomous driving policies through fast and scalable traffic simulation that maintains human-like behavior.

Abstract: Developing autonomous vehicles (AVs) requires not only safety and efficiency,
but also realistic, human-like behaviors that are socially aware and
predictable. Achieving this requires sim agent policies that are human-like,
fast, and scalable in multi-agent settings. Recent progress in imitation
learning with large diffusion-based or tokenized models has shown that
behaviors can be captured directly from human driving data, producing realistic
policies. However, these models are computationally expensive, slow during
inference, and struggle to adapt in reactive, closed-loop scenarios. In
contrast, self-play reinforcement learning (RL) scales efficiently and
naturally captures multi-agent interactions, but it often relies on heuristics
and reward shaping, and the resulting policies can diverge from human norms. We
propose SPACeR, a framework that leverages a pretrained tokenized
autoregressive motion model as a centralized reference policy to guide
decentralized self-play. The reference model provides likelihood rewards and KL
divergence, anchoring policies to the human driving distribution while
preserving RL scalability. Evaluated on the Waymo Sim Agents Challenge, our
method achieves competitive performance with imitation-learned policies while
being up to 10x faster at inference and 50x smaller in parameter size than
large generative models. In addition, we demonstrate in closed-loop ego
planning evaluation tasks that our sim agents can effectively measure planner
quality with fast and scalable traffic simulation, establishing a new paradigm
for testing autonomous driving policies.

*Jiajun Fan,Chaoran Cheng,Shuaike Shen,Xiangxin Zhou,Ge Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AC-Flow is a robust actor-critic framework that enables stable fine-tuning of flow-based generative models using intermediate feedback, addressing credit assignment and training instability issues through reward shaping, dual-stability mechanisms, and scalable critic weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning flow-based generative models with intermediate feedback is challenging due to credit assignment problems and training instabilities in existing approaches that rely solely on outcome rewards or direct regression on cumulative rewards.

Method: Three key innovations: (1) reward shaping for normalized learning signals, (2) dual-stability mechanism with advantage clipping and warm-up phase, and (3) scalable generalized critic weighting with Wasserstein regularization.

Result: AC-Flow achieves state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image alignment tasks and generalization to unseen human preference models on Stable Diffusion 3, maintaining generative quality, diversity, and stability with computationally efficient critic models.

Conclusion: The framework enables robust fine-tuning of flow models without compromising performance, demonstrating that stable intermediate feedback learning is feasible even with efficient critic architectures.

Abstract: Flow-based generative models have shown remarkable success in text-to-image
generation, yet fine-tuning them with intermediate feedback remains
challenging, especially for continuous-time flow matching models. Most existing
approaches solely learn from outcome rewards, struggling with the credit
assignment problem. Alternative methods that attempt to learn a critic via
direct regression on cumulative rewards often face training instabilities and
model collapse in online settings. We present AC-Flow, a robust actor-critic
framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations: (1)
reward shaping that provides well-normalized learning signals to enable stable
intermediate value learning and gradient control, (2) a novel dual-stability
mechanism that combines advantage clipping to prevent destructive policy
updates with a warm-up phase that allows the critic to mature before
influencing the actor, and (3) a scalable generalized critic weighting scheme
that extends traditional reward-weighted methods while preserving model
diversity through Wasserstein regularization. Through extensive experiments on
Stable Diffusion 3, we demonstrate that AC-Flow achieves state-of-the-art
performance in text-to-image alignment tasks and generalization to unseen human
preference models. Our results demonstrate that even with a computationally
efficient critic model, we can robustly finetune flow models without
compromising generative quality, diversity, or stability.

*Nadir Farhi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel RL formulation that maximizes the probability of cumulative return exceeding a threshold, enabling reliable policies with performance guarantees using standard RL algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications like routing and resource allocation require strategies that ensure not only high average performance but also guaranteed probability of success, rather than just maximizing expected return.

Method: Reformulate the reliable RL problem via state-augmented representation into standard RL problems, allowing use of existing algorithms like Q-learning and Dueling Double DQN without new frameworks.

Result: Theoretical equivalence established between formulations. Numerical experiments on reliable routing show policies effectively balance efficiency and reliability in stochastic environments.

Conclusion: The proposed reliable RL framework enables derivation of strategies with performance guarantees using standard RL methods, demonstrating practical relevance for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of determining reliable policies in
reinforcement learning (RL), with a focus on optimization under uncertainty and
the need for performance guarantees. While classical RL algorithms aim at
maximizing the expected return, many real-world applications - such as routing,
resource allocation, or sequential decision-making under risk - require
strategies that ensure not only high average performance but also a guaranteed
probability of success. To this end, we propose a novel formulation in which
the objective is to maximize the probability that the cumulative return exceeds
a prescribed threshold. We demonstrate that this reliable RL problem can be
reformulated, via a state-augmented representation, into a standard RL problem,
thereby allowing the use of existing RL and deep RL algorithms without the need
for entirely new algorithmic frameworks. Theoretical results establish the
equivalence of the two formulations and show that reliable strategies can be
derived by appropriately adapting well-known methods such as Q-learning or
Dueling Double DQN. To illustrate the practical relevance of the approach, we
consider the problem of reliable routing, where the goal is not to minimize the
expected travel time but rather to maximize the probability of reaching the
destination within a given time budget. Numerical experiments confirm that the
proposed formulation leads to policies that effectively balance efficiency and
reliability, highlighting the potential of reliable RL for applications in
stochastic and safety-critical environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Created an experimental database for machine learning-based anomaly detection in chemical processes using a lab-scale batch distillation plant, including fault-free and anomalous data with various sensor readings and unconventional data sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of openly available experimental data that hinders the development of ML-based anomaly detection methods in chemical processes.

Method: Set up a laboratory-scale batch distillation plant and conducted 119 experiments across various operating conditions and mixtures, intentionally inducing anomalies and pairing them with fault-free experiments. Collected time-series data from sensors, actuators, and unconventional sources like NMR spectroscopy, video, and audio recordings.

Result: Generated an extensive experimental database with 119 experiments, including sensor data, measurement uncertainty estimates, concentration profiles, video/audio recordings, metadata, and expert annotations based on a developed ontology. The database is freely available via doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17395544.

Conclusion: This database enables the development of advanced ML-based anomaly detection methods and supports interpretable/explainable ML approaches and anomaly mitigation techniques by providing comprehensive experimental data with cause information.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) holds great potential to advance anomaly detection (AD)
in chemical processes. However, the development of ML-based methods is hindered
by the lack of openly available experimental data. To address this gap, we have
set up a laboratory-scale batch distillation plant and operated it to generate
an extensive experimental database, covering fault-free experiments and
experiments in which anomalies were intentionally induced, for training
advanced ML-based AD methods. In total, 119 experiments were conducted across a
wide range of operating conditions and mixtures. Most experiments containing
anomalies were paired with a corresponding fault-free one. The database that we
provide here includes time-series data from numerous sensors and actuators,
along with estimates of measurement uncertainty. In addition, unconventional
data sources -- such as concentration profiles obtained via online benchtop NMR
spectroscopy and video and audio recordings -- are provided. Extensive metadata
and expert annotations of all experiments are included. The anomaly annotations
are based on an ontology developed in this work. The data are organized in a
structured database and made freely available via
doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17395544. This new database paves the way for the
development of advanced ML-based AD methods. As it includes information on the
causes of anomalies, it further enables the development of interpretable and
explainable ML approaches, as well as methods for anomaly mitigation.

TL;DR: MEG-GPT is a transformer-based foundation model for MEG data that uses time-attention and next time-point prediction, achieving improved decoding performance and zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods fail to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns in large-scale brain dynamics like MEG data, while foundation models have shown success in other domains.

Method: Developed a transformer model with time-attention and next time-point prediction, plus a novel data-driven tokenizer for continuous MEG signals that preserves temporal resolution without lossy transformations.

Result: Model generates realistic spatio-spectral data with transient events and population variability, improves downstream decoding tasks with better zero-shot generalization across sessions (0.54 to 0.59 accuracy) and subjects (0.41 to 0.49 accuracy), and can be efficiently fine-tuned.

Conclusion: Establishes a powerful foundation model for electrophysiological data, enabling applications in computational neuroscience and neural decoding.

Abstract: Modelling the complex spatiotemporal patterns of large-scale brain dynamics
is crucial for neuroscience, but traditional methods fail to capture the rich
structure in modalities such as magnetoencephalography (MEG). Recent advances
in deep learning have enabled significant progress in other domains, such as
language and vision, by using foundation models at scale. Here, we introduce
MEG-GPT, a transformer based foundation model that uses time-attention and next
time-point prediction. To facilitate this, we also introduce a novel
data-driven tokeniser for continuous MEG data, which preserves the high
temporal resolution of continuous MEG signals without lossy transformations. We
trained MEG-GPT on tokenised brain region time-courses extracted from a
large-scale MEG dataset (N=612, eyes-closed rest, Cam-CAN data), and show that
the learnt model can generate data with realistic spatio-spectral properties,
including transient events and population variability. Critically, it performs
well in downstream decoding tasks, improving downstream supervised prediction
task, showing improved zero-shot generalisation across sessions (improving
accuracy from 0.54 to 0.59) and subjects (improving accuracy from 0.41 to 0.49)
compared to a baseline methods. Furthermore, we show the model can be
efficiently fine-tuned on a smaller labelled dataset to boost performance in
cross-subject decoding scenarios. This work establishes a powerful foundation
model for electrophysiological data, paving the way for applications in
computational neuroscience and neural decoding.

*Jiawei Zhang,Andrew Estornell,David D. Baek,Bo Li,Xiaojun Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADA (Any-Depth Alignment) is an inference-time defense method that reintroduces assistant header tokens mid-generation to unlock LLMs' innate shallow alignment, enabling robust safety protection at arbitrary generation depths without model parameter changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs exhibit shallow alignment where safety protections collapse once harmful continuations are underway, raising the need for ensuring safety at arbitrary generation depths beyond initial refusals.

Method: ADA reintroduces alignment-concentrated assistant header tokens mid-stream during generation, leveraging the model's strong alignment priors to reassess harmfulness and recover refusals at any point.

Result: Across multiple model families, ADA achieves near-100% refusal rate against adversarial prefill attacks, reduces success rates of prominent adversarial attacks below 3%, and maintains utility on benign tasks with minimal over-refusal.

Conclusion: ADA provides effective inference-time safety defense that maintains resilience even after subsequent instruction tuning, demonstrating that innate shallow alignment in LLMs can be unlocked for robust protection.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong but shallow alignment: they
directly refuse harmful queries when a refusal is expected at the very start of
an assistant turn, yet this protection collapses once a harmful continuation is
underway (either through the adversarial attacks or via harmful
assistant-prefill attacks). This raises a fundamental question: Can the innate
shallow alignment in LLMs be unlocked to ensure safety at arbitrary generation
depths? To achieve this goal, we propose Any-Depth Alignment (ADA), an
effective inference-time defense with negligible overhead. ADA is built based
on our observation that alignment is concentrated in the assistant header
tokens through repeated use in shallow-refusal training, and these tokens
possess the model's strong alignment priors. By reintroducing these tokens
mid-stream, ADA induces the model to reassess harmfulness and recover refusals
at any point in generation. Across diverse open-source model families (Llama,
Gemma, Mistral, Qwen, DeepSeek, and gpt-oss), ADA achieves robust safety
performance without requiring any changes to the base model's parameters. It
secures a near-100% refusal rate against challenging adversarial prefill
attacks ranging from dozens to thousands of tokens. Furthermore, ADA reduces
the average success rate of prominent adversarial prompt attacks (such as GCG,
AutoDAN, PAIR, and TAP) to below 3%. This is all accomplished while preserving
utility on benign tasks with minimal over-refusal. ADA maintains this
resilience even after the base model undergoes subsequent instruction tuning
(benign or adversarial).

### [202] [Provably Optimal Reinforcement Learning under Safety Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18082)
*Donggeon David Oh,Duy P. Nguyen,Haimin Hu,Jaime F. Fisac*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Safety filters in RL can enforce categorical safety without degrading asymptotic performance, enabling complete separation between safety enforcement and performance optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL lacks formal safety guarantees for safety-critical applications, and safety filters are often perceived as sacrificing performance and hindering learning.

Method: Formalize RL safety with safety-critical MDP (SC-MDP) and define filtered MDP where safety filter is part of environment. Prove theoretical guarantees for safety and performance.

Result: Zero violations during training in Safety Gymnasium tasks, with final performance matching or exceeding unfiltered baselines.

Conclusion: Safety filters don't inherently trade off performance for safety - train and deploy RL policies with the most permissive safety filter available.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) enable its use on increasingly
complex tasks, but the lack of formal safety guarantees still limits its
application in safety-critical settings. A common practical approach is to
augment the RL policy with a safety filter that overrides unsafe actions to
prevent failures during both training and deployment. However, safety filtering
is often perceived as sacrificing performance and hindering the learning
process. We show that this perceived safety-performance tradeoff is not
inherent and prove, for the first time, that enforcing safety with a
sufficiently permissive safety filter does not degrade asymptotic performance.
We formalize RL safety with a safety-critical Markov decision process (SC-MDP),
which requires categorical, rather than high-probability, avoidance of
catastrophic failure states. Additionally, we define an associated filtered MDP
in which all actions result in safe effects, thanks to a safety filter that is
considered to be a part of the environment. Our main theorem establishes that
(i) learning in the filtered MDP is safe categorically, (ii) standard RL
convergence carries over to the filtered MDP, and (iii) any policy that is
optimal in the filtered MDP-when executed through the same filter-achieves the
same asymptotic return as the best safe policy in the SC-MDP, yielding a
complete separation between safety enforcement and performance optimization. We
validate the theory on Safety Gymnasium with representative tasks and
constraints, observing zero violations during training and final performance
matching or exceeding unfiltered baselines. Together, these results shed light
on a long-standing question in safety-filtered learning and provide a simple,
principled recipe for safe RL: train and deploy RL policies with the most
permissive safety filter that is available.

*Nursultan Mamatov,Philipp Kellmeyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine learning models combining structured clinical data and unstructured text (discharge summaries, radiology reports) significantly improve in-hospital mortality prediction in ICUs, achieving 22% relative improvement in AUC compared to using structured data alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate early prediction of in-hospital mortality in ICUs is essential for timely clinical intervention and efficient resource allocation.

Method: Used LASSO and XGBoost for feature selection, followed by multivariate logistic regression trained on top features. Incorporated textual features using TF-IDF and BERT embeddings from MIMIC-IV database.

Result: Final logistic regression model combining structured and textual input achieved AUC of 0.918 vs 0.753 with structured data alone (22% relative improvement). Decision curve analysis showed superior standardized net benefit across threshold probabilities 0.2-0.8.

Conclusion: Unstructured clinical notes provide added prognostic value and should be integrated into interpretable feature-driven risk prediction models for ICU patients.

Abstract: Accurate early prediction of in-hospital mortality in intensive care units
(ICUs) is essential for timely clinical intervention and efficient resource
allocation. This study develops and evaluates machine learning models that
integrate both structured clinical data and unstructured textual information,
specifically discharge summaries and radiology reports, from the MIMIC-IV
database. We used LASSO and XGBoost for feature selection, followed by a
multivariate logistic regression trained on the top features identified by both
models. Incorporating textual features using TF-IDF and BERT embeddings
significantly improved predictive performance. The final logistic regression
model, which combined structured and textual input, achieved an AUC of 0.918,
compared to 0.753 when using structured data alone, a relative improvement 22%.
The analysis of the decision curve demonstrated a superior standardized net
benefit in a wide range of threshold probabilities (0.2-0.8), confirming the
clinical utility of the model. These results underscore the added prognostic
value of unstructured clinical notes and support their integration into
interpretable feature-driven risk prediction models for ICU patients.

*Dario Shariatian,Alain Durmus,Stefano Peluchetti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Latent Discrete Diffusion Models (LDDMs) combine masked discrete diffusion over tokens with continuous diffusion over latent embeddings to improve joint structure modeling and generation quality in few-step settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of masked denoisers where reverse transitions factorize across positions, weakening joint structure and degrading quality in few-step generation.

Method: Propose LDDMs with two variants: FUJI-LDDMs (fully joint denoising of tokens and latents) and SEQ-LDDMs (sequential resolution of latent then discrete chain). Use ELBO-style objectives and design choices for informative latents.

Result: LDDMs show improvements on unconditional generation metrics compared to state-of-the-art masked discrete diffusion baselines, especially effective at lower sampling budgets where unmasking many tokens per step is desirable.

Conclusion: Latent channels provide softer signals and cross-token dependencies that help resolve ambiguities, making LDDMs effective for discrete diffusion modeling with improved joint structure.

Abstract: We study discrete diffusion for language and other categorical data and focus
on a common limitation of masked denoisers: reverse transitions typically
factorize across positions, which can weaken joint structure and degrade
quality in few-step generation. We propose \emph{Latent Discrete Diffusion
Models} (LDDMs), which couple a masked discrete diffusion over tokens with a
continuous diffusion over latent embeddings. The latent channel provides a
softer signal and carries cross-token dependencies that help resolve
ambiguities. We present two instantiations: (i) FUJI-LDDMs, which perform fully
joint denoising of tokens and latents, and (ii) SEQ-LDDMs, which sequentially
resolve the latent and then the discrete chain conditionally on it. For both
variants we derive ELBO-style objectives and discuss design choices to learn
informative latents yet amenable to diffusoin modeling. In experiments, LDDMs
yield improvements on unconditional generation metrics as compared to
state-of-the-art masked discrete diffusion baselines, and are effective at
lower sampling budgets, where unmasking many tokens per step is desirable.

*Teodora Reu,Sixtine Dromigny,Michael Bronstein,Francisco Vargas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Rectified Flows can fail by memorizing training pairs instead of learning meaningful transport, especially under deterministic training. Adding noise helps restore generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why Rectified Flows sometimes fail to generalize and instead memorize arbitrary training pairings, even when interpolant lines intersect.

Method: Analyzed Gaussian-to-Gaussian transport using gradient variance analysis across stochastic and deterministic regimes, and proved existence of memorizing vector fields. Validated on CelebA dataset.

Result: Deterministic training drives memorization of training pairs, while small noise injection restores generalization. The straight-path objective converges to ill-defined memorizing fields.

Conclusion: Rectified Flows' straight-path objective has fundamental failure modes that lead to memorization rather than meaningful transport, requiring stochastic elements for proper generalization.

Abstract: Rectified Flows learn ODE vector fields whose trajectories are straight
between source and target distributions, enabling near one-step inference. We
show that this straight-path objective conceals fundamental failure modes:
under deterministic training, low gradient variance drives memorization of
arbitrary training pairings, even when interpolant lines between pairs
intersect. To analyze this mechanism, we study Gaussian-to-Gaussian transport
and use the loss gradient variance across stochastic and deterministic regimes
to characterize which vector fields optimization favors in each setting. We
then show that, in a setting where all interpolating lines intersect, applying
Rectified Flow yields the same specific pairings at inference as during
training. More generally, we prove that a memorizing vector field exists even
when training interpolants intersect, and that optimizing the straight-path
objective converges to this ill-defined field. At inference, deterministic
integration reproduces the exact training pairings. We validate our findings
empirically on the CelebA dataset, confirming that deterministic interpolants
induce memorization, while the injection of small noise restores
generalization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAD is a technique that improves long-context LLM training by separating core attention computation from other model components and running it on dedicated devices to address load imbalance issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems colocate core attention with other layers, causing load imbalance and stragglers at long context lengths due to core attention's quadratic compute growth versus near-linear growth of other components.

Method: CAD decouples core attention computation (softmax(QK^T)V) from the rest of the model, partitions it into token-level tasks, and dispatches them to dedicated attention servers that dynamically rebatch tasks for compute balance while maintaining kernel efficiency.

Result: On 512 H200 GPUs with context lengths up to 512k tokens, DistCA implementation improves training throughput by up to 1.35x, eliminates data and pipeline parallel stragglers, and achieves near-perfect compute and memory balance.

Conclusion: CAD effectively addresses load imbalance in long-context LLM training by disaggregating core attention computation, enabling better resource utilization and improved training efficiency through dedicated attention servers.

Abstract: We present core attention disaggregation (CAD), a technique that improves
long-context large language model training by decoupling the core attention
computation, softmax(QK^T)V, from the rest of the model and executing it on a
separate pool of devices. In existing systems, core attention is colocated with
other layers; at long context lengths, its quadratic compute growth compared to
the near-linear growth of other components causes load imbalance and stragglers
across data and pipeline parallel groups. CAD is enabled by two observations.
First, core attention is stateless: it has no trainable parameters and only
minimal transient data, so balancing reduces to scheduling compute-bound tasks.
Second, it is composable: modern attention kernels retain high efficiency when
processing fused batches of token-level shards with arbitrary lengths. CAD
partitions core attention into token-level tasks and dispatches them to
dedicated attention servers, which dynamically rebatch tasks to equalize
compute without sacrificing kernel efficiency. We implement CAD in a system
called DistCA, which uses a ping-pong execution scheme to fully overlap
communication with computation and in-place execution on attention servers to
reduce memory use. On 512 H200 GPUs and context lengths up to 512k tokens,
DistCA improves end-to-end training throughput by up to 1.35x, eliminates data
and pipeline parallel stragglers, and achieves near-perfect compute and memory
balance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HyperDiffusionFields (HyDiF) models 3D molecular conformers as continuous fields using Molecular Directional Fields (MDFs) represented by neural implicit fields, with a hypernetwork-based diffusion model for generation and property prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of discrete atomic representations (coordinates/graphs) by modeling molecules as continuous fields, enabling fine-grained spatial analysis and better generalization across molecules.

Method: Uses Molecular Directional Fields (MDFs) as vector fields mapping space to nearest atom directions, represented by molecule-specific neural implicit fields generated by a shared hypernetwork trained as a denoising diffusion model.

Result: Enables molecular generation, structure-conditioned tasks like inpainting, fine-grained property prediction, and scales to larger biomolecules.

Conclusion: HyDiF provides a promising field-based molecular modeling approach that naturally supports generation, conditioning, and spatial analysis tasks not easily achievable with traditional representations.

Abstract: We introduce HyperDiffusionFields (HyDiF), a framework that models 3D
molecular conformers as continuous fields rather than discrete atomic
coordinates or graphs. At the core of our approach is the Molecular Directional
Field (MDF), a vector field that maps any point in space to the direction of
the nearest atom of a particular type. We represent MDFs using
molecule-specific neural implicit fields, which we call Molecular Neural Fields
(MNFs). To enable learning across molecules and facilitate generalization, we
adopt an approach where a shared hypernetwork, conditioned on a molecule,
generates the weights of the given molecule's MNF. To endow the model with
generative capabilities, we train the hypernetwork as a denoising diffusion
model, enabling sampling in the function space of molecular fields. Our design
naturally extends to a masked diffusion mechanism to support
structure-conditioned generation tasks, such as molecular inpainting, by
selectively noising regions of the field. Beyond generation, the localized and
continuous nature of MDFs enables spatially fine-grained feature extraction for
molecular property prediction, something not easily achievable with graph or
point cloud based methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach scales
to larger biomolecules, illustrating a promising direction for field-based
molecular modeling.

Motivation: Motivated by the connection between self-attention and kernel PCA, the authors aim to revisit PCA fundamentals and provide new theoretical insights using the difference-of-convex framework.

Method: Using the difference-of-convex (DC) framework, the authors present novel formulations for PCA, show kernelizability and out-of-sample applicability, and describe new algorithms including a kernelizable dual formulation for robust PCA.

Result: The paper demonstrates that simultaneous iteration (connected to the QR algorithm) is an instance of DCA, provides new PCA algorithms, and introduces a kernelizable robust PCA variant that minimizes l1 reconstruction errors.

Conclusion: The DC framework offers new optimization perspectives on PCA, connecting classical methods like QR algorithm to modern optimization, and enables kernelizable robust PCA formulations.

Abstract: Motivated by the recently shown connection between self-attention and
(kernel) principal component analysis (PCA), we revisit the fundamentals of
PCA. Using the difference-of-convex (DC) framework, we present several novel
formulations and provide new theoretical insights. In particular, we show the
kernelizability and out-of-sample applicability for a PCA-like family of
problems. Moreover, we uncover that simultaneous iteration, which is connected
to the classical QR algorithm, is an instance of the difference-of-convex
algorithm (DCA), offering an optimization perspective on this longstanding
method. Further, we describe new algorithms for PCA and empirically compare
them with state-of-the-art methods. Lastly, we introduce a kernelizable dual
formulation for a robust variant of PCA that minimizes the $l_1$ deviation of
the reconstruction errors.

*Eason Yu,Tzu Hao Liu,Yunke Wang,Clément L. Canonne,Nguyen H. Tran,Chang Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Nash Policy Gradient (NashPG), a method that converges to exact Nash equilibria in imperfect-information games by fixing regularization strength and iteratively refining reference policies, achieving monotonic improvement without uniqueness assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing regularization-based methods require shrinking regularization strength to zero, leading to unstable learning. The paper aims to develop a more robust approach that maintains fixed regularization for stability while still converging to exact Nash equilibria.

Method: Nash Policy Gradient (NashPG) fixes regularization strength at a large value for robustness and achieves convergence by iteratively refining the reference policy. It preserves policy gradient generalizability and relies only on current and reference policies.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows strictly monotonic improvement and convergence to exact Nash equilibrium in two-player zero-sum games without uniqueness assumptions. Empirically, NashPG achieves comparable or lower exploitability than prior methods and scales to large domains like Battleship and No-Limit Texas Hold'em with higher Elo ratings.

Conclusion: NashPG provides a robust alternative to shrinking-regularization methods, enabling stable convergence to exact Nash equilibria while maintaining the benefits of policy gradient approaches and scaling effectively to complex imperfect-information games.

Abstract: Finding Nash equilibria in imperfect-information games remains a central
challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning. While regularization-based
methods have recently achieved last-iteration convergence to a regularized
equilibrium, they require the regularization strength to shrink toward zero to
approximate a Nash equilibrium, often leading to unstable learning in practice.
Instead, we fix the regularization strength at a large value for robustness and
achieve convergence by iteratively refining the reference policy. Our main
theoretical result shows that this procedure guarantees strictly monotonic
improvement and convergence to an exact Nash equilibrium in two-player zero-sum
games, without requiring a uniqueness assumption. Building on this framework,
we develop a practical algorithm, Nash Policy Gradient (NashPG), which
preserves the generalizability of policy gradient methods while relying solely
on the current and reference policies. Empirically, NashPG achieves comparable
or lower exploitability than prior model-free methods on classic benchmark
games and scales to large domains such as Battleship and No-Limit Texas

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ActivationReasoning (AR) embeds logical reasoning into LLM latent spaces using sparse autoencoders to map activations to logical propositions for systematic reasoning and model control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs generate fluent text but lack transparent, controllable internal reasoning. Sparse autoencoders provide interpretable features but are passive and fragile, offering no systematic reasoning mechanism.

Method: Three-stage framework: (1) Find latent concept representations via SAEs, (2) Map activating concepts to logical propositions at inference, (3) Apply logical rules to infer structures, compose concepts, and steer behavior.

Result: AR scales robustly with reasoning complexity, generalizes to abstract/context-sensitive tasks, transfers across model backbones, and improves performance on multi-hop reasoning, abstraction, and safety tasks.

Conclusion: Grounding logical structure in latent activations improves transparency and enables structured reasoning, reliable control, and behavioral alignment, providing a path toward more reliable and auditable AI.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating fluent text, but their
internal reasoning remains opaque and difficult to control. Sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) make hidden activations more interpretable by exposing latent features
that often align with human concepts. Yet, these features are fragile and
passive, offering no mechanism for systematic reasoning or model control. To
address this, we introduce ActivationReasoning (AR), a framework that embeds
explicit logical reasoning into the latent space of LLMs. It proceeds in three
stages: (1) Finding latent representations, first latent concept
representations are identified (e.g., via SAEs) and organized into a
dictionary; (2) Activating propositions, at inference time AR detects
activating concepts and maps them to logical propositions; and (3)Logical
reasoning, applying logical rules over these propositions to infer higher-order
structures, compose new concepts, and steer model behavior. We evaluate AR on
multi-hop reasoning (PrOntoQA), abstraction and robustness to indirect concept
cues (Rail2Country), reasoning over natural and diverse language (ProverQA),
and context-sensitive safety (BeaverTails). Across all tasks, AR scales
robustly with reasoning complexity, generalizes to abstract and
context-sensitive tasks, and transfers across model backbones. These results
demonstrate that grounding logical structure in latent activations not only
improves transparency but also enables structured reasoning, reliable control,
and alignment with desired behaviors, providing a path toward more reliable and
auditable AI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multistage ensemble framework using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations for optimal control without stabilizer terms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional numerical solutions to Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations are computationally intensive, and analytical solutions are often unavailable. Knowledge-guided machine learning like PINNs offers alternative approaches to overcome these difficulties.

Method: Multistage ensemble framework using PINNs to learn optimal cost-to-go and corresponding optimal control signals through the HJB equation, without using stabilizer terms. Can produce either singular learned control signals or ensemble control signal policies.

Result: Successfully demonstrated closed-loop control of a steady-state time-invariant two-state continuous nonlinear system with infinite time horizon, handling noisy perturbed system states and varying initial conditions using both ensemble and singular control approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides an effective alternative to traditional HJB equation solving methods, enabling optimal control system design without stabilizer terms while handling real-world challenges like noise and varying conditions.

Abstract: The objective of designing a control system is to steer a dynamical system
with a control signal, guiding it to exhibit the desired behavior. The
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) partial differential equation offers a framework
for optimal control system design. However, numerical solutions to this
equation are computationally intensive, and analytical solutions are frequently
unavailable. Knowledge-guided machine learning methodologies, such as
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), offer new alternative approaches that
can alleviate the difficulties of solving the HJB equation numerically. This
work presents a multistage ensemble framework to learn the optimal cost-to-go,
and subsequently the corresponding optimal control signal, through the HJB
equation. Prior PINN-based approaches rely on a stabilizing the HJB enforcement
during training. Our framework does not use stabilizer terms and offers a means
of controlling the nonlinear system, via either a singular learned control
signal or an ensemble control signal policy. Success is demonstrated in
closed-loop control, using both ensemble- and singular-control, of a
steady-state time-invariant two-state continuous nonlinear system with an
infinite time horizon, accounting of noisy, perturbed system states and varying
initial conditions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a hierarchical framework for underwater cooperative target detection using AUVs, balancing cooperation efficiency with communication covertness through joint trajectory and power control optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical trade-off between cooperation efficiency and communication covertness in underwater target detection using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs).

Method: Hierarchical action management framework with macro-level strategic task allocation using proximal policy optimization, and micro-level decentralized decision-making using multi-agent proximal policy optimization for trajectory and power control.

Result: The framework enables adaptive covert cooperation while satisfying energy and mobility constraints, providing theoretical insights and practical solutions for efficient and secure multi-AUV operations.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical framework offers significant implications for underwater covert communication tasks by enabling efficient and secure cooperative target detection with AUVs.

Abstract: This paper investigates underwater cooperative target detection using
autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), with a focus on the critical trade-off
between cooperation efficiency and communication covertness. To tackle this
challenge, we first formulate a joint trajectory and power control optimization
problem, and then present an innovative hierarchical action management
framework to solve it. According to the hierarchical formulation, at the macro
level, the master AUV models the agent selection process as a Markov decision
process and deploys the proximal policy optimization algorithm for strategic
task allocation. At the micro level, each selected agent's decentralized
decision-making is modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process,
and a multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm is used to dynamically
adjust its trajectory and transmission power based on its local observations.
Under the centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm, our target
detection framework enables adaptive covert cooperation while satisfying both
energy and mobility constraints. By comprehensively modeling the considered
system, the involved signals and tasks, as well as energy consumption,
theoretical insights and practical solutions for the efficient and secure
operation of multiple AUVs are provided, offering significant implications for
the execution of underwater covert communication tasks.

*Zhendong Mi,Qitao Tan,Grace Li Zhang,Zhaozhuo Xu,Geng Yuan,Shaoyi Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: P-GAP is a zeroth-order optimization method for LLM fine-tuning that reduces gradient estimation variance through projected gradient-aligned perturbations, achieving faster convergence and better performance with fewer resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zeroth-order optimization methods for LLM fine-tuning suffer from high variance in gradient estimation, leading to slow convergence and suboptimal performance on large-scale models.

Method: P-GAP estimates a low-dimensional gradient space and aligns perturbations in projected gradients' direction within that space, reducing the number of perturbed parameters and decreasing variance.

Result: P-GAP achieves up to 6% increase in accuracy on classification tasks and up to 12% higher accuracy on generation tasks, with up to 81% less training iterations and 70% less GPU hours compared to baselines.

Conclusion: P-GAP enables fast, scalable, and resource-efficient zeroth-order optimization for LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using zeroth-order (ZO) optimization
has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional gradient-based methods
due to its reduced memory footprint requirement. However, existing ZO methods
suffer from high variance in gradient estimation, leading to slow convergence
and suboptimal performance on large-scale models. In this work, we propose
P-GAP, a fast LLM fine-tuning approach through zeroth-order optimization with
Projected Gradient-Aligned Perturbations. Specifically, we first estimate a
low-dimensional gradient space and then align perturbations in projected
gradients' direction within the space. This approach enables reduced the number
of perturbed parameters and decreased variance, therefore accelerated
convergence for LLM fine-tuning. Experiments on LLMs show that P-GAP
consistently surpasses the baselines, achieving up to 6% increase in accuracy
on classification tasks and up to 12% higher accuracy on generation tasks, with
up to about 81% less training iterations and 70% less GPU hours. These results
demonstrate that P-GAP enables fast, scalable, and resource-efficient ZO LLM
fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ACTG-ARL: A hierarchical framework for differentially private synthetic text generation that combines attribute-conditioned text generation with anchored reinforcement learning to improve quality and control while preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior DP synthetic text generation methods fail to preserve key statistical attributes, suffer utility loss from DP noise, and lack fine-grained control over generation.

Method: Hierarchical framework with two subtasks: feature learning and conditional text generation. Uses DP tabular synthesizer and DP fine-tuned conditional generator (ACTG), plus Anchored RL for improved instruction following.

Result: Advances quality of DP synthetic text (+20% MAUVE over prior work) and improves control of conditional generator under strong privacy guarantees.

Conclusion: ACTG-ARL effectively addresses limitations of prior DP synthetic text generation methods by providing better quality, control, and privacy preservation.

Abstract: Generating high-quality synthetic text under differential privacy (DP) is
critical for training and evaluating language models without compromising user
privacy. Prior work on synthesizing DP datasets often fail to preserve key
statistical attributes, suffer utility loss from the noise required by DP, and
lack fine-grained control over generation. To address these challenges, we make
two contributions. First, we introduce a hierarchical framework that decomposes
DP synthetic text generation into two subtasks: feature learning and
conditional text generation. This design explicitly incorporates learned
features into the generation process and simplifies the end-to-end synthesis
task. Through systematic ablations, we identify the most effective
configuration: a rich tabular schema as feature, a DP tabular synthesizer, and
a DP fine-tuned conditional generator, which we term ACTG
(Attribute-Conditioned Text Generation). Second, we propose Anchored RL (ARL),
a post-training method that improves the instruction-following ability of ACTG
for conditional generation. ARL combines RL to boost control with an SFT anchor
on best-of-$N$ data to prevent reward hacking. Together, these components form
our end-to-end algorithm ACTG-ARL, which advances both the quality of DP
synthetic text (+20% MAUVE over prior work) and the control of the conditional
generator under strong privacy guarantees.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Current AI/ML review criteria overly prioritize projects that combine deployment with novel methodology, creating incentives that undermine sustainable social impact research ecosystem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address how current publication review criteria in AI/ML for social impact create problematic incentives by favoring only projects that achieve both deployment and methodological innovation simultaneously.

Method: Position paper arguing for adopting: 1) broader conception of social impacts beyond just deployment, and 2) more rigorous evaluation of deployed systems' actual impact.

Result: Identifies systemic issue in research incentives and proposes framework for more sustainable social impact research ecosystem.

Conclusion: Researchers and reviewers should expand their conception of social impact and implement more rigorous impact evaluations to support diverse contributions in AI/ML for social good.

Abstract: There has been increasing research interest in AI/ML for social impact, and
correspondingly more publication venues have refined review criteria for
practice-driven AI/ML research. However, these review guidelines tend to most
concretely recognize projects that simultaneously achieve deployment and novel
ML methodological innovation. We argue that this introduces incentives for
researchers that undermine the sustainability of a broader research ecosystem
of social impact, which benefits from projects that make contributions on
single front (applied or methodological) that may better meet project partner
needs. Our position is that researchers and reviewers in machine learning for
social impact must simultaneously adopt: 1) a more expansive conception of
social impacts beyond deployment and 2) more rigorous evaluations of the impact
of deployed systems.

### [216] [Learning with Dual-level Noisy Correspondence for Multi-modal Entity Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18240)
*Haobin Li,Yijie Lin,Peng Hu,Mouxing Yang,Xi Peng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RULE, a robust framework for multi-modal entity alignment that addresses Dual-level Noisy Correspondence (DNC) - misalignments in both intra-entity and inter-graph correspondences in real-world MMKGs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MMEA methods assume perfect correspondences, but real-world MMKGs often have noisy alignments due to expert annotation errors. The paper addresses the under-explored problem of DNC where both entity-attribute and entity-entity/attribute-attribute correspondences can be faulty.

Method: RULE estimates correspondence reliability via a two-fold principle, mitigates intra-entity noise during attribute fusion, prevents overfitting to noisy inter-graph correspondences during discrepancy elimination, and incorporates a correspondence reasoning module to uncover underlying attribute-attribute connections.

Result: Extensive experiments on five benchmarks show RULE effectively handles DNC and outperforms seven state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: RULE provides a robust solution for MMEA in noisy real-world scenarios by addressing dual-level correspondence noise through reliability estimation and correspondence reasoning.

Abstract: Multi-modal entity alignment (MMEA) aims to identify equivalent entities
across heterogeneous multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKGs), where each entity is
described by attributes from various modalities. Existing methods typically
assume that both intra-entity and inter-graph correspondences are faultless,
which is often violated in real-world MMKGs due to the reliance on expert
annotations. In this paper, we reveal and study a highly practical yet
under-explored problem in MMEA, termed Dual-level Noisy Correspondence (DNC).
DNC refers to misalignments in both intra-entity (entity-attribute) and
inter-graph (entity-entity and attribute-attribute) correspondences. To address
the DNC problem, we propose a robust MMEA framework termed RULE. RULE first
estimates the reliability of both intra-entity and inter-graph correspondences
via a dedicated two-fold principle. Leveraging the estimated reliabilities,
RULE mitigates the negative impact of intra-entity noise during attribute
fusion and prevents overfitting to noisy inter-graph correspondences during
inter-graph discrepancy elimination. Beyond the training-time designs, RULE
further incorporates a correspondence reasoning module that uncovers the
underlying attribute-attribute connection across graphs, guaranteeing more
accurate equivalent entity identification. Extensive experiments on five
benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our method against the DNC compared with
seven state-of-the-art methods.The code is available at

*Song Bian,Tao Yu,Shivaram Venkataraman,Youngsuk Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a conditional scaling law that incorporates architectural factors to optimize the trade-off between LLM accuracy and inference efficiency, showing improved performance over existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs grow larger and more widely deployed, inference costs become a critical concern, but the accuracy-efficiency trade-off remains underexplored.

Method: Developed a conditional scaling law extending Chinchilla framework with architectural information, trained 200+ models (80M-3B parameters), and created a search framework for optimal architectures.

Result: Optimized architectures achieved up to 2.1% higher accuracy and 42% greater inference throughput compared to LLaMA-3.2 under the same training budget.

Conclusion: The conditional scaling law reliably predicts optimal architectural choices for inference-efficient and accurate LLMs, outperforming existing open-source baselines.

Abstract: Scaling the number of parameters and the size of training data has proven to
be an effective strategy for improving large language model (LLM) performance.
Yet, as these models grow increasingly powerful and widely deployed, the cost
of inference has become a pressing concern. Despite its importance, the
trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency remains
underexplored. In this work, we examine how key architectural factors, hidden
size, the allocation of parameters between MLP and attention (mlp-to-attention
ratio), and grouped-query attention (GQA), influence both inference cost and
accuracy. We introduce a conditional scaling law that augments the Chinchilla
framework with architectural information, along with a search framework for
identifying architectures that are simultaneously inference-efficient and
accurate. To validate our approach, we train more than 200 models spanning 80M
to 3B parameters and 8B to 100B training tokens, and fit the proposed
conditional scaling law. Our results show that the conditional scaling law
reliably predicts optimal architectural choices and that the resulting models
outperform existing open-source baselines. Under the same training budget,
optimized architectures achieve up to 2.1% higher accuracy and 42% greater
inference throughput compared to LLaMA-3.2.

TL;DR: NTKMTL addresses task imbalance in multi-task learning by using Neural Tangent Kernel theory to analyze training dynamics and balance task convergence speeds, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Task imbalance remains a major challenge in Multi-Task Learning (MTL), making it difficult to balance convergence speeds across different tasks within complex MTL systems.

Method: Proposes NTKMTL method using Neural Tangent Kernel theory to analyze MTL training dynamics, introduces extended NTK matrix with spectral analysis to balance task convergence speeds, and develops NTKMTL-SR for efficient training via shared representation approximation.

Result: Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance across multi-task supervised learning and multi-task reinforcement learning benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed NTK-based approach effectively mitigates task imbalance in MTL while maintaining competitive performance and training efficiency.

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) enables a single model to learn multiple tasks
simultaneously, leveraging knowledge transfer among tasks for enhanced
generalization, and has been widely applied across various domains. However,
task imbalance remains a major challenge in MTL. Although balancing the
convergence speeds of different tasks is an effective approach to address this
issue, it is highly challenging to accurately characterize the training
dynamics and convergence speeds of multiple tasks within the complex MTL
system. To this end, we attempt to analyze the training dynamics in MTL by
leveraging Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory and propose a new MTL method,
NTKMTL. Specifically, we introduce an extended NTK matrix for MTL and adopt
spectral analysis to balance the convergence speeds of multiple tasks, thereby
mitigating task imbalance. Based on the approximation via shared
representation, we further propose NTKMTL-SR, achieving training efficiency
while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of
benchmarks, including both multi-task supervised learning and multi-task
reinforcement learning. Source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subject-driven image generation models face a fundamental trade-off between identity preservation (fidelity) and prompt adherence (editability), and naive application of GRPO leads to competitive degradation due to conflicting gradient signals and misalignment with diffusion process dynamics.

Method: Proposes Customized-GRPO with two innovations: Synergy-Aware Reward Shaping (SARS) that penalizes conflicted reward signals and amplifies synergistic ones, and Time-Aware Dynamic Weighting (TDW) that aligns optimization pressure with model's temporal dynamics by prioritizing prompt-following early and identity preservation later.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method significantly outperforms naive GRPO baselines, successfully mitigating competitive degradation and achieving superior balance between identity preservation and prompt adherence.

Conclusion: Customized-GRPO successfully addresses the fidelity-editability trade-off by providing sharper gradient signals and temporal alignment, generating images that preserve key identity features while accurately adhering to complex textual prompts.

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation models face a fundamental trade-off between
identity preservation (fidelity) and prompt adherence (editability). While
online reinforcement learning (RL), specifically GPRO, offers a promising
solution, we find that a naive application of GRPO leads to competitive
degradation, as the simple linear aggregation of rewards with static weights
causes conflicting gradient signals and a misalignment with the temporal
dynamics of the diffusion process. To overcome these limitations, we propose
Customized-GRPO, a novel framework featuring two key innovations: (i)
Synergy-Aware Reward Shaping (SARS), a non-linear mechanism that explicitly
penalizes conflicted reward signals and amplifies synergistic ones, providing a
sharper and more decisive gradient. (ii) Time-Aware Dynamic Weighting (TDW),
which aligns the optimization pressure with the model's temporal dynamics by
prioritizing prompt-following in the early, identity preservation in the later.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
naive GRPO baselines, successfully mitigating competitive degradation. Our
model achieves a superior balance, generating images that both preserve key
identity features and accurately adhere to complex textual prompts.

TL;DR: TOT framework for online time series forecasting with theoretical guarantees on handling distribution shifts through latent variables


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address unknown distribution shifts in online time series forecasting where latent variables influence the mapping from historical to future observations

Method: Propose TOT framework with theoretical analysis, use temporal decoder to match observed variable distribution and two independent noise estimators for latent variable causal inference and mixing procedures

Result: Theoretical proofs show latent variables tighten Bayes risk, experiments on synthetic data support claims, plug-in implementations on baselines show general improvement across benchmarks

Conclusion: TOT framework effectively handles distribution shifts in online time series forecasting with theoretical guarantees and practical improvements

Abstract: This paper is concerned with online time series forecasting, where unknown
distribution shifts occur over time, i.e., latent variables influence the
mapping from historical to future observations. To develop an automated way of
online time series forecasting, we propose a Theoretical framework for Online
Time-series forecasting (TOT in short) with theoretical guarantees.
Specifically, we prove that supplying a forecaster with latent variables
tightens the Bayes risk, the benefit endures under estimation uncertainty of
latent variables and grows as the latent variables achieve a more precise
identifiability. To better introduce latent variables into online forecasting
algorithms, we further propose to identify latent variables with minimal
adjacent observations. Based on these results, we devise a model-agnostic
blueprint by employing a temporal decoder to match the distribution of observed
variables and two independent noise estimators to model the causal inference of
latent variables and mixing procedures of observed variables, respectively.
Experiment results on synthetic data support our theoretical claims. Moreover,
plug-in implementations built on several baselines yield general improvement
across multiple benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness in real-world
applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes two physics-informed bandit algorithms (pretc and prgreedy) for mmWave beam alignment that exploit sparse multipath properties instead of unimodality assumptions, showing superior performance across diverse channel environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional bandit algorithms for beam alignment rely on unimodality/multimodality assumptions that often don't hold in practice, causing convergence to suboptimal beams. Need more robust methods that exploit realistic channel properties.

Method: Two algorithms: pretc (random exploration then commitment) and prgreedy (online estimation). Both exploit sparse multipath property of mmWave channels and maintain optimal estimates of path parameters based on sampled historical rewards.

Result: Both algorithms outperform existing approaches across diverse channel environments using synthetic DeepMIMO and real-world DeepSense6G datasets, demonstrating generalizability and robustness.

Conclusion: Physics-informed bandit algorithms that exploit sparse multipath properties provide more effective and robust beam alignment than methods relying on unimodality assumptions, with strong performance across various scenarios.

Abstract: In millimeter wave (mmWave) communications, beam alignment and tracking are
crucial to combat the significant path loss. As scanning the entire directional
space is inefficient, designing an efficient and robust method to identify the
optimal beam directions is essential. Since traditional bandit algorithms
require a long time horizon to converge under large beam spaces, many existing
works propose efficient bandit algorithms for beam alignment by relying on
unimodality or multimodality assumptions on the reward function's structure.
However, such assumptions often do not hold (or cannot be strictly satisfied)
in practice, which causes such algorithms to converge to choosing suboptimal
beams.
  In this work, we propose two physics-informed bandit algorithms
\textit{pretc} and \textit{prgreedy} that exploit the sparse multipath property
of mmWave channels - a generic but realistic assumption - which is connected to
the Phase Retrieval Bandit problem. Our algorithms treat the parameters of each
path as black boxes and maintain optimal estimates of them based on sampled
historical rewards. \textit{pretc} starts with a random exploration phase and
then commits to the optimal beam under the estimated reward function.
\textit{prgreedy} performs such estimation in an online manner and chooses the
best beam under current estimates. Our algorithms can also be easily adapted to
beam tracking in the mobile setting. Through experiments using both the
synthetic DeepMIMO dataset and the real-world DeepSense6G dataset, we
demonstrate that both algorithms outperform existing approaches in a wide range
of scenarios across diverse channel environments, showing their
generalizability and robustness.

TL;DR: The paper proposes CHiLD, a framework for identifying hierarchical latent dynamics in time series data using three conditionally independent observations and sparse hierarchical structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing temporal causal representation learning methods fail to capture hierarchical latent dynamics because they cannot recover joint distributions of hierarchical latent variables from single-timestep observations.

Method: Uses temporal contextual observed variables to identify joint distribution of multi-layer latent variables, exploits natural sparsity of hierarchical structure, and develops a variational inference-based generative model with contextual encoder and flow-based hierarchical prior networks.

Result: Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets validate theoretical claims and demonstrate CHiLD's effectiveness in modeling hierarchical latent dynamics.

Conclusion: The CHiLD framework successfully identifies hierarchical latent dynamics by leveraging conditionally independent observations and hierarchical sparsity, providing a novel approach for capturing multi-level temporal dependencies.

Abstract: Modeling hierarchical latent dynamics behind time series data is critical for
capturing temporal dependencies across multiple levels of abstraction in
real-world tasks. However, existing temporal causal representation learning
methods fail to capture such dynamics, as they fail to recover the joint
distribution of hierarchical latent variables from \textit{single-timestep
observed variables}. Interestingly, we find that the joint distribution of
hierarchical latent variables can be uniquely determined using three
conditionally independent observations. Building on this insight, we propose a
Causally Hierarchical Latent Dynamic (CHiLD) identification framework. Our
approach first employs temporal contextual observed variables to identify the
joint distribution of multi-layer latent variables. Sequentially, we exploit
the natural sparsity of the hierarchical structure among latent variables to
identify latent variables within each layer. Guided by the theoretical results,
we develop a time series generative model grounded in variational inference.
This model incorporates a contextual encoder to reconstruct multi-layer latent
variables and normalize flow-based hierarchical prior networks to impose the
independent noise condition of hierarchical latent dynamics. Empirical
evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate our theoretical
claims and demonstrate the effectiveness of CHiLD in modeling hierarchical
latent dynamics.

TL;DR: Transformers trained on bubble-sort tasks develop structured internal world models, with larger embedding dimensions improving representation quality, consistency, and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how embedding dimension affects the emergence of internal world models in transformers performing algorithmic tasks like bubble sort.

Method: Train transformers with reinforcement learning to perform adjacent swaps in bubble-sort style, varying embedding dimensions across hundreds of experiments.

Result: Models achieve high accuracy even with small dimensions, but larger dimensions yield more faithful, consistent, and robust internal representations with structured encoding of global ordering.

Conclusion: Transformers build structured internal world models, and model size improves representation quality beyond just end performance, with consistent mechanisms for encoding ordering and selecting transpositions.

Abstract: We investigate how embedding dimension affects the emergence of an internal
"world model" in a transformer trained with reinforcement learning to perform
bubble-sort-style adjacent swaps. Models achieve high accuracy even with very
small embedding dimensions, but larger dimensions yield more faithful,
consistent, and robust internal representations. In particular, higher
embedding dimensions strengthen the formation of structured internal
representation and lead to better interpretability. After hundreds of
experiments, we observe two consistent mechanisms: (1) the last row of the
attention weight matrix monotonically encodes the global ordering of tokens;
and (2) the selected transposition aligns with the largest adjacent difference
of these encoded values. Our results provide quantitative evidence that
transformers build structured internal world models and that model size
improves representation quality in addition to end performance. We release our
metrics and analyses, which can be used to probe similar algorithmic tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional evidential deep learning (EDL) has restrictive Dirichlet distribution assumptions that limit robustness in complex scenarios, requiring more flexible uncertainty modeling for high-stakes applications.

Method: Extends EDL by predicting flexible Dirichlet distributions (generalizations of standard Dirichlet) over class probabilities to provide more expressive and adaptive uncertainty representation.

Result: F-EDL demonstrates state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification performance across diverse evaluation settings including classical, long-tailed, and noisy in-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: Flexible evidential deep learning significantly enhances uncertainty quantification generalization and reliability under challenging scenarios compared to traditional EDL approaches.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is crucial for deploying machine learning
models in high-stakes applications, where overconfident predictions can lead to
serious consequences. An effective UQ method must balance computational
efficiency with the ability to generalize across diverse scenarios. Evidential
deep learning (EDL) achieves efficiency by modeling uncertainty through the
prediction of a Dirichlet distribution over class probabilities. However, the
restrictive assumption of Dirichlet-distributed class probabilities limits
EDL's robustness, particularly in complex or unforeseen situations. To address
this, we propose \textit{flexible evidential deep learning}
($\mathcal{F}$-EDL), which extends EDL by predicting a flexible Dirichlet
distribution -- a generalization of the Dirichlet distribution -- over class
probabilities. This approach provides a more expressive and adaptive
representation of uncertainty, significantly enhancing UQ generalization and
reliability under challenging scenarios. We theoretically establish several
advantages of $\mathcal{F}$-EDL and empirically demonstrate its
state-of-the-art UQ performance across diverse evaluation settings, including
classical, long-tailed, and noisy in-distribution scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TCCM is a semi-supervised anomaly detection method for tabular data that learns time-conditioned contraction vectors toward the origin, offering efficient training, fast inference, and explainable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inference bottleneck and computational cost of existing continuous-time models like diffusion-based methods, while maintaining high detection accuracy for tabular anomaly detection.

Method: Builds on flow matching concepts but simplifies by predicting time-conditioned contraction vectors toward a fixed target (origin) at each time step, eliminating need for solving ODEs during training/inference.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ADBench benchmark, especially on high-dimensional and large-scale datasets, while achieving favorable balance between accuracy and inference cost.

Conclusion: TCCM provides an efficient, scalable, and explainable approach to tabular anomaly detection with theoretical robustness guarantees and practical performance advantages.

Abstract: We introduce Time-Conditioned Contraction Matching (TCCM), a novel method for
semi-supervised anomaly detection in tabular data. TCCM is inspired by flow
matching, a recent generative modeling framework that learns velocity fields
between probability distributions and has shown strong performance compared to
diffusion models and generative adversarial networks. Instead of directly
applying flow matching as originally formulated, TCCM builds on its core idea
-- learning velocity fields between distributions -- but simplifies the
framework by predicting a time-conditioned contraction vector toward a fixed
target (the origin) at each sampled time step. This design offers three key
advantages: (1) a lightweight and scalable training objective that removes the
need for solving ordinary differential equations during training and inference;
(2) an efficient scoring strategy called one time-step deviation, which
quantifies deviation from expected contraction behavior in a single forward
pass, addressing the inference bottleneck of existing continuous-time models
such as DTE (a diffusion-based model with leading anomaly detection accuracy
but heavy inference cost); and (3) explainability and provable robustness, as
the learned velocity field operates directly in input space, making the anomaly
score inherently feature-wise attributable; moreover, the score function is
Lipschitz-continuous with respect to the input, providing theoretical
guarantees under small perturbations. Extensive experiments on the ADBench
benchmark show that TCCM strikes a favorable balance between detection accuracy
and inference cost, outperforming state-of-the-art methods -- especially on
high-dimensional and large-scale datasets. The source code is available at our
GitHub repository.

### [226] [Why Policy Gradient Algorithms Work for Undiscounted Total-Reward MDPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18340)
*Jongmin Lee,Ernest K. Ryu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides theoretical analysis of policy gradient methods for undiscounted total-reward MDPs (γ=1), addressing limitations of existing theory that assumes γ<1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern policy-based RL for large language models uses undiscounted settings (γ=1), but existing convergence theory assumes γ<1, making current theory inapplicable to these practical applications.

Method: The analysis uses two key insights: (1) classification of MDP states into recurrent and transient states is invariant for policies with strictly positive action probabilities, and (2) replacing the classical state visitation measure with a new 'transient visitation measure' that works with γ=1.

Result: The paper establishes theoretical foundations for policy gradient methods in undiscounted total-reward infinite-horizon MDPs, providing convergence guarantees that were previously unavailable.

Conclusion: The work bridges the gap between theoretical RL analysis and practical applications in large language models by extending policy gradient theory to undiscounted settings.

Abstract: The classical policy gradient method is the theoretical and conceptual
foundation of modern policy-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Most
rigorous analyses of such methods, particularly those establishing convergence
guarantees, assume a discount factor $\gamma < 1$. In contrast, however, a
recent line of work on policy-based RL for large language models uses the
undiscounted total-reward setting with $\gamma = 1$, rendering much of the
existing theory inapplicable. In this paper, we provide analyses of the policy
gradient method for undiscounted expected total-reward infinite-horizon MDPs
based on two key insights: (i) the classification of the MDP states into
recurrent and transient states is invariant over the set of policies that
assign strictly positive probability to every action (as is typical in deep RL
models employing a softmax output layer) and (ii) the classical state
visitation measure (which may be ill-defined when $\gamma = 1$) can be replaced
with a new object that we call the transient visitation measure.

*Dariusz Kalociński,Tomasz Steifer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper shows that universal online learning does not necessarily imply computable implementation, even for relatively simple hypothesis classes, and provides exact characterizations for computable agnostic and proper universal online learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address when learning can be implemented as a computer program, moving beyond abstract mathematical characterizations to practical computability in universal online learning models.

Method: Analyzes computable universal online learning through computability-theoretic perspective, studying agnostic and proper variants, and providing exact characterizations of learnable classes.

Result: Demonstrates that universal online learning does not imply computable universal online learning, even for easy computability classes, and provides complete characterizations for computable agnostic and proper variants.

Conclusion: The results provide a more realistic perspective on online binary classification theory by bridging the gap between abstract mathematical learning and practical computable implementation.

Abstract: Understanding when learning is possible is a fundamental task in the theory
of machine learning. However, many characterizations known from the literature
deal with abstract learning as a mathematical object and ignore the crucial
question: when can learning be implemented as a computer program? We address
this question for universal online learning, a generalist theoretical model of
online binary classification, recently characterized by Bousquet et al.
(STOC'21). In this model, there is no hypothesis fixed in advance; instead,
Adversary -- playing the role of Nature -- can change their mind as long as
local consistency with the given class of hypotheses is maintained. We require
Learner to achieve a finite number of mistakes while using a strategy that can
be implemented as a computer program. We show that universal online learning
does not imply computable universal online learning, even if the class of
hypotheses is relatively easy from a computability-theoretic perspective. We
then study the agnostic variant of computable universal online learning and
provide an exact characterization of classes that are learnable in this sense.
We also consider a variant of proper universal online learning and show exactly
when it is possible. Together, our results give a more realistic perspective on
the existing theory of online binary classification and the related problem of
inductive inference.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hydra Ensembles is an efficient transformer-based ensemble method that prunes attention heads to create diverse members and merges them using grouped fully-connected layers, achieving strong uncertainty quantification performance with inference speed close to a single network.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep Ensembles provide strong uncertainty quantification but have high computational and memory costs that limit scalability to large models, creating a need for more efficient ensemble methods.

Method: Prune attention heads in transformers to create diverse ensemble members, then merge them using a new multi-head attention mechanism with grouped fully-connected layers to form a compact model.

Result: Achieves inference speed close to a single network while matching or surpassing Deep Ensembles in uncertainty quantification performance, with consistent gains across image and text classification tasks and state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot classification on ImageNet-1k.

Conclusion: Hydra Ensembles provides an efficient alternative to Deep Ensembles that maintains strong uncertainty quantification while being computationally efficient, with analysis showing that careful pruning preserves calibration better than naive approaches.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for deploying deep neural
networks in safety-critical settings. Although methods like Deep Ensembles
achieve strong UQ performance, their high computational and memory costs hinder
scalability to large models. We introduce Hydra Ensembles, an efficient
transformer-based ensemble that prunes attention heads to create diverse
members and merges them via a new multi-head attention with grouped
fully-connected layers. This yields a compact model with inference speed close
to a single network, matching or surpassing Deep Ensembles in UQ performance
without retraining from scratch. We also provide an in-depth analysis of
pruning, showing that naive approaches can harm calibration, whereas Hydra
Ensembles preserves robust uncertainty. Experiments on image and text
classification tasks, with various architectures, show consistent gains over
Deep Ensembles. Remarkably, in zero-shot classification on ImageNet-1k, our
approach surpasses state of the art methods, even without requiring additional
training.

TL;DR: FGP is a novel pre-training method that trains neural architecture encoders to capture information flow using flow surrogates, achieving up to 106% performance improvement without requiring specialized model structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flow-based neural architecture encoders are slow due to their complex structures, creating practical challenges despite their effectiveness in capturing information flow.

Method: FGP pre-trains encoders by reconstructing flow surrogates - proposed representations of neural architecture information flow - without needing specialized model structures.

Result: FGP boosts encoder performance by up to 106% in Precision-1% compared to supervised learning alone.

Conclusion: FGP enables efficient capture of information flow in neural architectures without the computational overhead of specialized model structures, significantly improving encoder performance.

Abstract: The performance of a deep learning model on a specific task and dataset
depends heavily on its neural architecture, motivating considerable efforts to
rapidly and accurately identify architectures suited to the target task and
dataset. To achieve this, researchers use machine learning models-typically
neural architecture encoders-to predict the performance of a neural
architecture. Many state-of-the-art encoders aim to capture information flow
within a neural architecture, which reflects how information moves through the
forward pass and backpropagation, via a specialized model structure. However,
due to their complicated structures, these flow-based encoders are
significantly slower to process neural architectures compared to simpler
encoders, presenting a notable practical challenge. To address this, we propose
FGP, a novel pre-training method for neural architecture encoding that trains
an encoder to capture the information flow without requiring specialized model
structures. FGP trains an encoder to reconstruct a flow surrogate, our proposed
representation of the neural architecture's information flow. Our experiments
show that FGP boosts encoder performance by up to 106% in Precision-1%,
compared to the same encoder trained solely with supervised learning.

### [230] [Towards Unsupervised Open-Set Graph Domain Adaptation via Dual Reprogramming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18363)
*Zhen Zhang,Bingsheng He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphRTA is a novel framework for unsupervised open-set graph domain adaptation that performs graph and model reprogramming to classify known classes and recognize unknown classes in target graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph domain adaptation models assume closed-set settings with identical label spaces, but real-world scenarios often involve target domains with classes not present in the source domain, requiring open-set adaptation.

Method: GraphRTA conducts dual reprogramming: (1) graph reprogramming by modifying target graph structure and node features to separate known/unknown classes, and (2) model reprogramming by pruning domain-specific parameters while preserving transferable patterns. It also extends the classifier with an extra dimension for unknown class.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on public datasets show GraphRTA achieves satisfactory performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed GraphRTA framework effectively addresses unsupervised open-set graph domain adaptation by combining graph and model reprogramming techniques, eliminating the need for manual threshold specification in open-set recognition.

Abstract: Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation has become a promising paradigm for
transferring knowledge from a fully labeled source graph to an unlabeled target
graph. Existing graph domain adaptation models primarily focus on the
closed-set setting, where the source and target domains share the same label
spaces. However, this assumption might not be practical in the real-world
scenarios, as the target domain might include classes that are not present in
the source domain. In this paper, we investigate the problem of unsupervised
open-set graph domain adaptation, where the goal is to not only correctly
classify target nodes into the known classes, but also recognize previously
unseen node types into the unknown class. Towards this end, we propose a novel
framework called GraphRTA, which conducts reprogramming on both the graph and
model sides. Specifically, we reprogram the graph by modifying target graph
structure and node features, which facilitates better separation of known and
unknown classes. Meanwhile, we also perform model reprogramming by pruning
domain-specific parameters to reduce bias towards the source graph while
preserving parameters that capture transferable patterns across graphs.
Additionally, we extend the classifier with an extra dimension for the unknown
class, thus eliminating the need of manually specified threshold in open-set
recognition. Comprehensive experiments on several public datasets demonstrate
that our proposed model can achieve satisfied performance compared with recent
state-of-the-art baselines. Our source codes and datasets are publicly
available at https://github.com/cszhangzhen/GraphRTA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single GNN performance is limited by real-world graph heterogeneity, and assembling multiple diverse GNNs with distinct generalization patterns can significantly improve performance through Mixture-of-Experts frameworks.

Method: Conducted comprehensive evaluation of 20 diversification strategies including random re-initialization, hyperparameter tuning, architectural variation, directionality modeling, and training data partitioning across 14 node classification benchmarks, analyzing over 200 ensemble variants.

Conclusion: The findings provide actionable guidance for expert training and the design of effective Mixture-of-Experts frameworks on graph data, establishing best practices for GNN ensemble diversification.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential tools for learning on
relational data, yet the performance of a single GNN is often limited by the
heterogeneity present in real-world graphs. Recent advances in
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) frameworks demonstrate that assembling multiple,
explicitly diverse GNNs with distinct generalization patterns can significantly
improve performance. In this work, we present the first systematic empirical
study of expert-level diversification techniques for GNN ensembles. Evaluating
20 diversification strategies -- including random re-initialization,
hyperparameter tuning, architectural variation, directionality modeling, and
training data partitioning -- across 14 node classification benchmarks, we
construct and analyze over 200 ensemble variants. Our comprehensive evaluation
examines each technique in terms of expert diversity, complementarity, and
ensemble performance. We also uncovers mechanistic insights into training
maximally diverse experts. These findings provide actionable guidance for
expert training and the design of effective MoE frameworks on graph data. Our

*Miao Zhang,Junpeng Li,ChangChun HUa,Yana Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for weakly supervised learning where training examples are n-tuples containing exactly m positives, with only the count m observed. It develops an unbiased risk estimator and proves theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Weakly supervised learning often uses coarse aggregate signals instead of instance labels. The NTMP setting arises in applications like image classification with region proposals and multi-instance measurements, where only tuple counts are available.

Method: Develops a trainable unbiased risk estimator by linking tuple-generation to latent instance marginals. Extends from fixed (n,m) to variable tuple sizes and counts. Uses ReLU corrections for finite-sample stability while preserving asymptotic correctness.

Result: The approach consistently outperforms weak-supervision baselines across benchmarks converted to NTMP tasks, achieving favorable precision-recall and F1 trade-offs. It remains robust under class-prior imbalance and diverse tuple configurations.

Conclusion: Count-only supervision can be effectively exploited through a theoretically grounded and practically stable objective, demonstrating that tuple counts provide sufficient information for successful learning in weakly supervised settings.

Abstract: Weakly supervised learning often operates with coarse aggregate signals
rather than instance labels. We study a setting where each training example is
an $n$-tuple containing exactly m positives, while only the count m per tuple
is observed. This NTMP (N-tuple with M positives) supervision arises in, e.g.,
image classification with region proposals and multi-instance measurements. We
show that tuple counts admit a trainable unbiased risk estimator (URE) by
linking the tuple-generation process to latent instance marginals. Starting
from fixed (n,m), we derive a closed-form URE and extend it to variable tuple
sizes, variable counts, and their combination. Identification holds whenever
the effective mixing rate is separated from the class prior. We establish
generalization bounds via Rademacher complexity and prove statistical
consistency with standard rates under mild regularity assumptions. To improve
finite-sample stability, we introduce simple ReLU corrections to the URE that
preserve asymptotic correctness. Across benchmarks converted to NTMP tasks, the
approach consistently outperforms representative weak-supervision baselines and
yields favorable precision-recall and F1 trade-offs. It remains robust under
class-prior imbalance and across diverse tuple configurations, demonstrating
that count-only supervision can be exploited effectively through a
theoretically grounded and practically stable objective.

TL;DR: CMT is a variational framework for sampling Boltzmann distributions that uses constrained KL divergence and entropy decay between steps to prevent mode collapse and mass teleportation, achieving 2.5x higher effective sample size than state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for sampling Boltzmann distributions suffer from mode collapse (in variational approaches) or mass teleportation and schedule tuning issues (in annealing methods), requiring a more robust sampling approach.

Method: Constrained Mass Transport (CMT) generates intermediate distributions with constraints on both KL divergence and entropy decay between successive steps to enhance distributional overlap and prevent premature convergence.

Result: CMT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art variational methods across benchmarks, achieving more than 2.5x higher effective sample size while avoiding mode collapse, even on the largest system studied without molecular dynamics samples (ELIL tetrapeptide).

Conclusion: CMT provides an effective variational framework for sampling Boltzmann distributions that overcomes key limitations of existing methods, particularly mode collapse and mass teleportation issues.

Abstract: Efficient sampling from high-dimensional and multimodal unnormalized
probability distributions is a central challenge in many areas of science and
machine learning. We focus on Boltzmann generators (BGs) that aim to sample the
Boltzmann distribution of physical systems, such as molecules, at a given
temperature. Classical variational approaches that minimize the reverse
Kullback-Leibler divergence are prone to mode collapse, while annealing-based
methods, commonly using geometric schedules, can suffer from mass teleportation
and rely heavily on schedule tuning. We introduce Constrained Mass Transport
(CMT), a variational framework that generates intermediate distributions under
constraints on both the KL divergence and the entropy decay between successive
steps. These constraints enhance distributional overlap, mitigate mass
teleportation, and counteract premature convergence. Across standard BG
benchmarks and the here introduced ELIL tetrapeptide, the largest system
studied to date without access to samples from molecular dynamics, CMT
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art variational methods, achieving more
than 2.5x higher effective sample size while avoiding mode collapse.

Motivation: Existing methods for heterogeneous temporal graphs use decoupled temporal and spatial learning, which weakens spatio-temporal interactions and leads to high model complexity.

Method: Proposes SE-HTGNN with dynamic attention mechanism that retains historical attention information to guide subsequent computation, and leverages large language models to capture implicit node type properties as prior knowledge.

Result: Achieves up to 10x speed-up over state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining best forecasting accuracy in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: SE-HTGNN provides an efficient and effective learning paradigm for heterogeneous temporal graphs by integrating temporal modeling into spatial learning and leveraging LLM prompting.

Abstract: Heterogeneous temporal graphs (HTGs) are ubiquitous data structures in the
real world. Recently, to enhance representation learning on HTGs, numerous
attention-based neural networks have been proposed. Despite these successes,
existing methods rely on a decoupled temporal and spatial learning paradigm,
which weakens interactions of spatio-temporal information and leads to a high
model complexity. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel learning paradigm for
HTGs called Simple and Efficient Heterogeneous Temporal Graph N}eural Network
(SE-HTGNN). Specifically, we innovatively integrate temporal modeling into
spatial learning via a novel dynamic attention mechanism, which retains
attention information from historical graph snapshots to guide subsequent
attention computation, thereby improving the overall discriminative
representations learning of HTGs. Additionally, to comprehensively and
adaptively understand HTGs, we leverage large language models to prompt
SE-HTGNN, enabling the model to capture the implicit properties of node types
as prior knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SE-HTGNN achieves up
to 10x speed-up over the state-of-the-art and latest baseline while maintaining
the best forecasting accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs often produce biased predictions, but no prior studies have evaluated fairness-aware GNNs on knowledge graphs, which are crucial for applications like recommender systems.

Method: Generated new graphs from three knowledge graphs (YAGO, DBpedia, Wikidata), benchmarked inprocessing and preprocessing methods with different GNN backbones and early stopping conditions.

Result: Knowledge graphs show clearer fairness-accuracy trade-offs than other graphs; performance depends on GNN backbones and early stopping; preprocessing improves fairness metrics while inprocessing improves prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: Knowledge graphs exhibit distinct fairness characteristics requiring specialized approaches, with preprocessing and inprocessing methods offering complementary benefits for fairness and accuracy respectively.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for learning from
graph-structured data but often produce biased predictions with respect to
sensitive attributes. Fairness-aware GNNs have been actively studied for
mitigating biased predictions. However, no prior studies have evaluated
fairness-aware GNNs on knowledge graphs, which are one of the most important
graphs in many applications, such as recommender systems. Therefore, we
introduce a benchmarking study on knowledge graphs. We generate new graphs from
three knowledge graphs, YAGO, DBpedia, and Wikidata, that are significantly
larger than the existing graph datasets used in fairness studies. We benchmark
inprocessing and preprocessing methods in different GNN backbones and early
stopping conditions. We find several key insights: (i) knowledge graphs show
different trends from existing datasets; clearer trade-offs between prediction
accuracy and fairness metrics than other graphs in fairness-aware GNNs, (ii)
the performance is largely affected by not only fairness-aware GNN methods but
also GNN backbones and early stopping conditions, and (iii) preprocessing
methods often improve fairness metrics, while inprocessing methods improve
prediction accuracy.

TL;DR: USC introduces uncertainty-aware modulation in critic training to enable safe RL exploration by concentrating conservatism in uncertain/costly regions while preserving gradients in safe areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safe RL methods struggle to balance safety and performance - strict safety enforcement cripples task performance, while reward-focused approaches frequently violate safety constraints and create diffuse cost landscapes.

Method: Uncertain Safety Critic (USC) integrates uncertainty-aware modulation and refinement into critic training, focusing conservatism on uncertain and costly regions while maintaining sharp gradients in safe areas.

Result: USC reduces safety violations by ~40% while maintaining competitive or higher rewards, and reduces error between predicted and true cost gradients by ~83%.

Conclusion: USC breaks the prevailing trade-off between safety and performance, enabling effective reward-safety trade-offs and paving the way for scalable safe RL.

Abstract: Ensuring the safe exploration of reinforcement learning (RL) agents is
critical for deployment in real-world systems. Yet existing approaches struggle
to strike the right balance: methods that tightly enforce safety often cripple
task performance, while those that prioritize reward leave safety constraints
frequently violated, producing diffuse cost landscapes that flatten gradients
and stall policy improvement. We introduce the Uncertain Safety Critic (USC), a
novel approach that integrates uncertainty-aware modulation and refinement into
critic training. By concentrating conservatism in uncertain and costly regions
while preserving sharp gradients in safe areas, USC enables policies to achieve
effective reward-safety trade-offs. Extensive experiments show that USC reduces
safety violations by approximately 40% while maintaining competitive or higher
rewards, and reduces the error between predicted and true cost gradients by
approximately 83%, breaking the prevailing trade-off between safety and
performance and paving the way for scalable safe RL.

Motivation: Existing approaches assume perfect hazard detection capabilities and lack finite-sample guarantees, which is insufficient for safety-critical navigation where reliable uncertainty handling is essential.

Method: Integrates conformal prediction with semantic segmentation to produce calibrated hazard maps with rigorous bounds for missed detections, then uses these maps to create risk-aware cost fields for downstream reinforcement learning planning.

Result: Achieves up to 6x increase in hazard coverage compared to baselines, near-complete detection of unsafe regions, and reduces hazardous violations during navigation by approximately 50% while maintaining robustness to distributional shift.

Conclusion: COPPOL provides a principled approach to uncertainty-aware perception with finite-sample guarantees, significantly improving safety and reliability in navigation tasks while preserving efficiency.

Abstract: Reliable navigation in safety-critical environments requires both accurate
hazard perception and principled uncertainty handling to strengthen downstream
safety handling. Despite the effectiveness of existing approaches, they assume
perfect hazard detection capabilities, while uncertainty-aware perception
approaches lack finite-sample guarantees. We present COPPOL, a conformal-driven
perception-to-policy learning approach that integrates distribution-free,
finite-sample safety guarantees into semantic segmentation, yielding calibrated
hazard maps with rigorous bounds for missed detections. These maps induce
risk-aware cost fields for downstream RL planning. Across two satellite-derived
benchmarks, COPPOL increases hazard coverage (up to 6x) compared to comparative
baselines, achieving near-complete detection of unsafe regions while reducing
hazardous violations during navigation (up to approx 50%). More importantly,
our approach remains robust to distributional shift, preserving both safety and
efficiency.

### [241] [Partial VOROS: A Cost-aware Performance Metric for Binary Classifiers with Precision and Capacity Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18520)
*Christopher Ratigan,Kyle Heuton,Carissa Wang,Lenore Cowen,Michael C. Hughes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new performance metric called partial VOROS that addresses limitations of conventional ROC analysis for hospital alert systems by incorporating precision constraints, capacity limits, and asymmetric costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional ROC analysis fails to capture crucial deployment factors for hospital alert systems, including minimum precision constraints to avoid false alarm fatigue, capacity limits on predicted positives, and asymmetric costs for false positives/negatives.

Method: The authors define a feasible region in ROC space for classifiers meeting precision and capacity constraints, then introduce the partial area of lesser classifiers metric that only considers feasible portions of ROC space. This is averaged over cost parameters to create partial VOROS.

Result: Experiments on MIMIC-IV dataset for mortality risk prediction show that the proposed cost-aware metric (partial VOROS) outperforms alternatives for ranking classifiers in hospital alert applications.

Conclusion: The partial VOROS metric provides a more appropriate evaluation framework for hospital alert systems by incorporating practical deployment constraints and cost asymmetries that conventional ROC analysis ignores.

Abstract: The ROC curve is widely used to assess binary classification performance. Yet
for some applications such as alert systems for hospitalized patient
monitoring, conventional ROC analysis cannot capture crucial factors that
impact deployment, such as enforcing a minimum precision constraint to avoid
false alarm fatigue or imposing an upper bound on the number of predicted
positives to represent the capacity of hospital staff. The usual area under the
curve metric also does not reflect asymmetric costs for false positives and
false negatives. In this paper we address all three of these issues. First, we
show how the subset of classifiers that meet given precision and capacity
constraints can be represented as a feasible region in ROC space. We establish
the geometry of this feasible region. We then define the partial area of lesser
classifiers, a performance metric that is monotonic with cost and only accounts
for the feasible portion of ROC space. Averaging this area over a desired range
of cost parameters results in the partial volume over the ROC surface, or
partial VOROS. In experiments predicting mortality risk using vital sign
history on the MIMIC-IV dataset, we show this cost-aware metric is better than
alternatives for ranking classifiers in hospital alert applications.

### [242] [Pay Attention to the Triggers: Constructing Backdoors That Survive Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18541)
*Giovanni De Muri,Mark Vero,Robin Staab,Martin Vechev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Knowledge distillation from backdoored LLM teachers poses security risks. Existing backdoors don't transfer well due to rare trigger tokens. T-MTB introduces transferable backdoors using common tokens that transfer during distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate security risks of knowledge distillation from potentially untrusted teacher models, as existing backdooring methods underestimate the transferability threat.

Method: Proposed T-MTB backdooring technique that constructs composite triggers using specific tokens that frequently occur in distillation datasets, enabling stealthy poisoning and transfer to student models.

Result: Demonstrated successful transfer of backdoors across jailbreaking and content modulation scenarios in four LLM families, showing significant security risks in knowledge distillation.

Conclusion: Knowledge distillation from untrusted teacher models poses serious security risks, and T-MTB enables study of transferable backdoors that can successfully propagate to student models during distillation.

Abstract: LLMs are often used by downstream users as teacher models for knowledge
distillation, compressing their capabilities into memory-efficient models.
However, as these teacher models may stem from untrusted parties, distillation
can raise unexpected security risks. In this paper, we investigate the security
implications of knowledge distillation from backdoored teacher models. First,
we show that prior backdoors mostly do not transfer onto student models. Our
key insight is that this is because existing LLM backdooring methods choose
trigger tokens that rarely occur in usual contexts. We argue that this
underestimates the security risks of knowledge distillation and introduce a new
backdooring technique, T-MTB, that enables the construction and study of
transferable backdoors. T-MTB carefully constructs a composite backdoor
trigger, made up of several specific tokens that often occur individually in
anticipated distillation datasets. As such, the poisoned teacher remains
stealthy, while during distillation the individual presence of these tokens
provides enough signal for the backdoor to transfer onto the student. Using
T-MTB, we demonstrate and extensively study the security risks of transferable
backdoors across two attack scenarios, jailbreaking and content modulation, and
across four model families of LLMs.

*Loc Phuc Truong Nguyen,Hung Thanh Do*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RAISE framework evaluates AI models across explainability, fairness, robustness, and sustainability dimensions, aggregating them into a single Responsibility Score. Evaluation of three deep learning models reveals trade-offs, with no single model dominating all criteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI systems enter high-stakes domains, evaluation must extend beyond predictive accuracy to include explainability, fairness, robustness, and sustainability for responsible AI deployment.

Method: Introduced RAISE framework that quantifies model performance across four dimensions (explainability, fairness, robustness, sustainability) and aggregates them into a holistic Responsibility Score. Evaluated three deep learning models (MLP, Tabular ResNet, Feature Tokenizer Transformer) on structured datasets from finance, healthcare, and socioeconomics.

Result: MLP showed strong sustainability and robustness; Transformer excelled in explainability and fairness but with high environmental cost; Tabular ResNet offered balanced profile. No single model dominated across all responsibility criteria.

Conclusion: Multi-dimensional evaluation is necessary for responsible model selection as trade-offs exist between different responsibility criteria, and no single model excels across all dimensions.

Abstract: As AI systems enter high-stakes domains, evaluation must extend beyond
predictive accuracy to include explainability, fairness, robustness, and
sustainability. We introduce RAISE (Responsible AI Scoring and Evaluation), a
unified framework that quantifies model performance across these four
dimensions and aggregates them into a single, holistic Responsibility Score. We
evaluated three deep learning models: a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), a Tabular
ResNet, and a Feature Tokenizer Transformer, on structured datasets from
finance, healthcare, and socioeconomics. Our findings reveal critical
trade-offs: the MLP demonstrated strong sustainability and robustness, the
Transformer excelled in explainability and fairness at a very high
environmental cost, and the Tabular ResNet offered a balanced profile. These
results underscore that no single model dominates across all responsibility
criteria, highlighting the necessity of multi-dimensional evaluation for
responsible model selection. Our implementation is available at:

### [244] [HeFS: Helper-Enhanced Feature Selection via Pareto-Optimized Genetic Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18575)
*Yusi Fan,Tian Wang,Zhiying Yan,Chang Liu,Qiong Zhou,Qi Lu,Zhehao Guo,Ziqi Deng,Wenyu Zhu,Ruochi Zhang,Fengfeng Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HeFS is a framework that enhances existing feature selection methods by finding complementary Helper Sets using genetic algorithms with biased initialization and Pareto optimization, achieving superior performance on 18 benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional feature selection methods often get stuck in local optima and miss subtle but informative features, especially in high-dimensional datasets with complex feature relationships.

Method: Uses genetic algorithm with biased initialization and ratio-guided mutation, combined with Pareto-based multi-objective optimization to maximize both predictive accuracy and feature complementarity.

Result: Consistently identifies overlooked informative features and achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods across 18 benchmark datasets, including challenging domains like cancer classification and drug toxicity prediction.

Conclusion: HeFS effectively refines feature subsets from existing algorithms by systematically searching for complementary features, demonstrating significant improvements in feature selection performance.

Abstract: Feature selection is a combinatorial optimization problem that is NP-hard.
Conventional approaches often employ heuristic or greedy strategies, which are
prone to premature convergence and may fail to capture subtle yet informative
features. This limitation becomes especially critical in high-dimensional
datasets, where complex and interdependent feature relationships prevail. We
introduce the HeFS (Helper-Enhanced Feature Selection) framework to refine
feature subsets produced by existing algorithms. HeFS systematically searches
the residual feature space to identify a Helper Set - features that complement
the original subset and improve classification performance. The approach
employs a biased initialization scheme and a ratio-guided mutation mechanism
within a genetic algorithm, coupled with Pareto-based multi-objective
optimization to jointly maximize predictive accuracy and feature
complementarity. Experiments on 18 benchmark datasets demonstrate that HeFS
consistently identifies overlooked yet informative features and achieves
superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, including in challenging
domains such as gastric cancer classification, drug toxicity prediction, and
computer science applications. The code and datasets are available at

*Chia-Hsuan Lu,Tony Tan,Michael Benedikt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RobLight improves GNN structural robustness verification by using efficient partial solvers instead of powerful constraint solvers, achieving better performance while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GNN adversarial robustness techniques rely on powerful constraint solvers like mixed integer programming, which can be computationally expensive. There's a need for more efficient verification methods.

Method: Replace powerful constraint solvers with efficient partial solvers that run in polynomial time but may be incomplete, focusing on structural robustness where attacks modify graph structure.

Result: RobLight achieves improved performance over state-of-the-art techniques on diverse GNN variants and datasets while maintaining verification accuracy.

Conclusion: Using efficient partial solvers instead of powerful constraint solvers can significantly improve GNN structural robustness verification performance without sacrificing effectiveness.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are the predominant architecture for learning
over graphs. As with any machine learning model, and important issue is the
detection of adversarial attacks, where an adversary can change the output with
a small perturbation of the input. Techniques for solving the adversarial
robustness problem - determining whether such an attack exists - were
originally developed for image classification, but there are variants for many
other machine learning architectures. In the case of graph learning, the attack
model usually considers changes to the graph structure in addition to or
instead of the numerical features of the input, and the state of the art
techniques in the area proceed via reduction to constraint solving, working on
top of powerful solvers, e.g. for mixed integer programming. We show that it is
possible to improve on the state of the art in structural robustness by
replacing the use of powerful solvers by calls to efficient partial solvers,
which run in polynomial time but may be incomplete. We evaluate our tool
RobLight on a diverse set of GNN variants and datasets.

### [246] [Unrolled-SINDy: A Stable Explicit Method for Non linear PDE Discovery from Sparsely Sampled Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18611)
*Fayad Ali Banna,Antoine Caradot,Eduardo Brandao,Jean-Philippe Colombier,Rémi Emonet,Marc Sebban*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unrolled-SINDy improves PDE discovery from sparse temporal data by decoupling numerical time step size from data sampling rate, enabling recovery of equation parameters that would be missed by original SINDy due to truncation errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SINDy-based approaches fail for real-world problems with sparsely sampled temporal data, where large local truncation errors prevent accurate parameter recovery.

Method: Leverages an unrolling scheme to improve stability of explicit methods for PDE discovery, decorrelating numerical time step size from data sampling rate. Can be implemented via iterative closed-form approach or gradient descent scheme.

Result: Method works with traditional SINDy and noise-robust iNeuralSINDy using different numerical schemes (Euler, RK4), enabling solution of problems inaccessible to non-unrolled methods.

Conclusion: Unrolled-SINDy provides a versatile approach that extends PDE discovery capabilities to sparse temporal sampling scenarios through unrolling schemes.

Abstract: Identifying from observation data the governing differential equations of a
physical dynamics is a key challenge in machine learning. Although approaches
based on SINDy have shown great promise in this area, they still fail to
address a whole class of real world problems where the data is sparsely sampled
in time. In this article, we introduce Unrolled-SINDy, a simple methodology
that leverages an unrolling scheme to improve the stability of explicit methods
for PDE discovery. By decorrelating the numerical time step size from the
sampling rate of the available data, our approach enables the recovery of
equation parameters that would not be the minimizers of the original SINDy
optimization problem due to large local truncation errors. Our method can be
exploited either through an iterative closed-form approach or by a gradient
descent scheme. Experiments show the versatility of our method. On both
traditional SINDy and state-of-the-art noise-robust iNeuralSINDy, with
different numerical schemes (Euler, RK4), our proposed unrolling scheme allows
to tackle problems not accessible to non-unrolled methods.

TL;DR: A new method for distilling boosted trees into decision trees to balance predictive performance and interpretability using rectification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create ML models that offer a good compromise between predictive performance and interpretability by distilling complex boosted trees into simpler decision trees.

Method: Uses a correction approach called rectification to implement the distillation process from boosted trees to decision trees.

Result: Empirical results show this approach provides interesting results compared to distillation achieved by retraining the model.

Conclusion: The rectification-based distillation approach effectively balances performance and interpretability, offering promising results for practical applications.

Abstract: We present a new approach for distilling boosted trees into decision trees,
in the objective of generating an ML model offering an acceptable compromise in
terms of predictive performance and interpretability. We explain how the
correction approach called rectification can be used to implement such a
distillation process. We show empirically that this approach provides
interesting results, in comparison with an approach to distillation achieved by
retraining the model.

*Satwik Bhattamishra,Phil Blunsom,Varun Kanade*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the learnability of languages in the Next Symbol Prediction (NSP) setting, which provides richer labels than conventional classification but still makes learning DFAs and Boolean formulas computationally hard.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the learnability of languages in the NSP setting, which is used to analyze neural sequence models and can help learn the support of language models.

Method: Formalizes the NSP setting for PAC-learning analysis and constructs a reduction from conventional learning problems to NSP learning, making most additional labels uninformative.

Result: Learning concept classes like DFAs and Boolean formulas remains computationally hard in the NSP setting, even with richer labels.

Conclusion: Despite providing more informative labels, the NSP setting does not make learning DFAs and Boolean formulas easier, as it remains computationally hard under cryptographic assumptions.

Abstract: We study the learnability of languages in the Next Symbol Prediction (NSP)
setting, where a learner receives only positive examples from a language
together with, for every prefix, (i) whether the prefix itself is in the
language and (ii) which next symbols can lead to an accepting string. This
setting has been used in prior works to empirically analyze neural sequence
models, and additionally, we observe that efficient algorithms for the NSP
setting can be used to learn the (truncated) support of language models. We
formalize the setting so as to make it amenable to PAC-learning analysis. While
the setting provides a much richer set of labels than the conventional
classification setting, we show that learning concept classes such as DFAs and
Boolean formulas remains computationally hard. The proof is via a construction
that makes almost all additional labels uninformative, yielding a reduction
from the conventional learning problem to learning with NSP labels. Under
cryptographic assumptions, the reduction implies that the problem of learning
DFAs is computationally hard in the NSP setting.

*Yanna Ding,Songtao Lu,Yingdong Lu,Tomasz Nowicki,Jianxi Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how transformers perform in-context learning for Markovian function learning, revealing that while global minimizers exist in an enlarged parameter space, recovering the actual transformer parameters is NP-hard for single-layer linear self-attention models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how transformers express in-context learning when modeling dynamics-driven functions, particularly Markovian functions, which extends beyond the typical linear regression tasks studied in existing theoretical work.

Method: The authors investigate Markovian function learning through a structured ICL setup, characterizing the loss landscape and optimization behaviors. They provide closed-form expressions for global minimizers, prove NP-hardness results for parameter recovery, and interpret multilayer linear self-attention as performing preconditioned gradient descent.

Result: The study shows that (1) global minimizers exist in an enlarged parameter space for single-layer linear self-attention, (2) recovering transformer parameters that realize the optimal solution is NP-hard in general, and (3) multilayer linear self-attention can be interpreted as performing preconditioned gradient descent for multiple objectives.

Conclusion: There is a fundamental limitation of one-layer linear self-attention in representing structured dynamical functions, but multilayer architectures can overcome this by performing more complex optimization procedures like preconditioned gradient descent.

Abstract: Transformer architectures can solve unseen tasks based on input-output pairs
in a given prompt due to in-context learning (ICL). Existing theoretical
studies on ICL have mainly focused on linear regression tasks, often with
i.i.d. inputs. To understand how transformers express ICL when modeling
dynamics-driven functions, we investigate Markovian function learning through a
structured ICL setup, where we characterize the loss landscape to reveal
underlying optimization behaviors. Specifically, we (1) provide the closed-form
expression of the global minimizer (in an enlarged parameter space) for a
single-layer linear self-attention (LSA) model; (2) prove that recovering
transformer parameters that realize the optimal solution is NP-hard in general,
revealing a fundamental limitation of one-layer LSA in representing structured
dynamical functions; and (3) supply a novel interpretation of a multilayer LSA
as performing preconditioned gradient descent to optimize multiple objectives
beyond the square loss. These theoretical results are numerically validated
using simplified transformers.

*Miro Miranda,Marcela Charfuelan,Matias Valdenegro Toro,Andreas Dengel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A physics-informed machine learning approach that couples crop simulation models with ML to predict crop yield by modeling water scarcity and drought stress, achieving high accuracy while maintaining explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between physically-based crop simulation models (explainable but poor performing) and machine learning models (powerful but black-box) for crop yield prediction.

Method: Formulate crop yield as a function of temporal water scarcity, predict crop drought stress and water scarcity sensitivity using multispectral satellite imagery, meteorological data, and yield data. Use physics-informed loss function and deep ensemble approach for uncertainty.

Result: Achieves R²-score of up to 0.82, surpassing state-of-the-art models like LSTM and Transformers in crop yield prediction.

Conclusion: The method provides accurate yield prediction with high explainability, offering decision support for building resilient agriculture in changing climate conditions.

Abstract: Water is essential for agricultural productivity. Assessing water shortages
and reduced yield potential is a critical factor in decision-making for
ensuring agricultural productivity and food security. Crop simulation models,
which align with physical processes, offer intrinsic explainability but often
perform poorly. Conversely, machine learning models for crop yield modeling are
powerful and scalable, yet they commonly operate as black boxes and lack
adherence to the physical principles of crop growth. This study bridges this
gap by coupling the advantages of both worlds. We postulate that the crop yield
is inherently defined by the water availability. Therefore, we formulate crop
yield as a function of temporal water scarcity and predict both the crop
drought stress and the sensitivity to water scarcity at fine-scale resolution.
Sequentially modeling the crop yield response to water enables accurate yield
prediction. To enforce physical consistency, a novel physics-informed loss
function is proposed. We leverage multispectral satellite imagery,
meteorological data, and fine-scale yield data. Further, to account for the
uncertainty within the model, we build upon a deep ensemble approach. Our
method surpasses state-of-the-art models like LSTM and Transformers in crop
yield prediction with a coefficient of determination ($R^2$-score) of up to
0.82 while offering high explainability. This method offers decision support
for industry, policymakers, and farmers in building a more resilient
agriculture in times of changing climate conditions.

*Madeline Navarro,Lisa O'Bryan,Santiago Segarra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A probabilistic model for predicting turn-taking in group conversations using individual characteristics and past speaking behavior, with generalization across different groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing conversation models lack generalization beyond single groups and use universal formulations that may not suit all groups, limiting insights into conversation dynamics.

Method: Generalization of prior conversation models that predicts speaking turns based on individual personality traits and prior speaking behavior, with novel ability to learn how speaking inclination varies based on when individuals last spoke.

Result: The model was applied to synthetic and real-world conversation data, verifying the approach and characterizing real group interactions, showing that previous behavioral models may not always be realistic.

Conclusion: The proposed data-driven yet theoretically grounded approach provides better generalization and more realistic modeling of conversation dynamics across different groups.

Abstract: We propose a flexible probabilistic model for predicting turn-taking patterns
in group conversations based solely on individual characteristics and past
speaking behavior. Many models of conversation dynamics cannot yield insights
that generalize beyond a single group. Moreover, past works often aim to
characterize speaking behavior through a universal formulation that may not be
suitable for all groups. We thus develop a generalization of prior conversation
models that predicts speaking turns among individuals in any group based on
their individual characteristics, that is, personality traits, and prior
speaking behavior. Importantly, our approach provides the novel ability to
learn how speaking inclination varies based on when individuals last spoke. We
apply our model to synthetic and real-world conversation data to verify the
proposed approach and characterize real group interactions. Our results
demonstrate that previous behavioral models may not always be realistic,
motivating our data-driven yet theoretically grounded approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of cardiovascular diseases using wearable sensors requires robust, efficient analysis. Deep learning can automate interpretation but needs to work on resource-constrained medical edge devices.

Method: Proposed convolutional neural network with early fusion of synchronized ECG and PCG data from Physionet Challenge 2016 dataset for binary classification.

Result: Model reduces memory footprint and compute cost by three orders of magnitude (1000x) compared to state-of-the-art while maintaining competitive accuracy. On-device inference is more energy-efficient than continuous data streaming.

Conclusion: Feasible to apply deep learning models for ECG/PCG classification on medical edge devices, enabling energy-efficient on-device inference for cardiovascular monitoring.

Abstract: The vast majority of cardiovascular diseases may be preventable if early
signs and risk factors are detected. Cardiovascular monitoring with body-worn
sensor devices like sensor patches allows for the detection of such signs while
preserving the freedom and comfort of patients. However, the analysis of the
sensor data must be robust, reliable, efficient, and highly accurate. Deep
learning methods can automate data interpretation, reducing the workload of
clinicians. In this work, we analyze the feasibility of applying deep learning
models to the classification of synchronized electrocardiogram (ECG) and
phonocardiogram (PCG) recordings on resource-constrained medical edge devices.
We propose a convolutional neural network with early fusion of data to solve a
binary classification problem. We train and validate our model on the
synchronized ECG and PCG recordings from the Physionet Challenge 2016 dataset.
Our approach reduces memory footprint and compute cost by three orders of
magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art while maintaining competitive
accuracy. We demonstrate the applicability of our proposed model on medical
edge devices by analyzing energy consumption on a microcontroller and an
experimental sensor device setup, confirming that on-device inference can be
more energy-efficient than continuous data streaming.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper conducts the first comprehensive study of reasoning large language model (RLLM) serving performance, revealing unique serving behaviors and evaluating existing inference optimization techniques for RLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLLMs have shown competitive performance in complex reasoning tasks, but their serving performance and behavior remain unexplored, which could undermine real-world deployment and utilization.

Method: The authors performed a pilot study comparing RLLM and traditional LLM serving performance, investigated the applicability of existing inference optimization techniques (model quantization, speculative decoding, prefix caching, KV cache quantization), and conducted evaluation under real-world workload modeled by Gamma distribution.

Result: Key findings include: (1) RLLMs exhibit significant memory usage and fluctuations, straggler requests, adaptive running time, and domain preference; (2) Model quantization and speculative decoding improve efficiency with small accuracy compromise; (3) Prefix caching and KV cache quantization may degrade accuracy or performance for small RLLMs; (4) Real-world workload evaluations confirm these findings.

Conclusion: The study provides insights for advancing RLLM inference serving, highlighting that while some optimization techniques work well for RLLMs, others may be detrimental, emphasizing the need for specialized serving strategies for reasoning-focused models.

Abstract: The reasoning large language model (RLLM) has been proven competitive in
solving complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics, coding, compared to
general LLM. However, the serving performance and behavior of RLLM remains
unexplored, which may undermine the deployment and utilization of RLLM in
real-world scenario. To close this gap, in this paper, we conduct a
comprehensive study of RLLM service. We first perform a pilot study on
comparing the serving performance between RLLM and traditional LLM and reveal
that there are several distinct differences regarding serving behavior: (1)
significant memory usage and fluctuations; (2) straggler requests; (3) adaptive
running time; (4) domain preference. Then we further investigate whether
existing inference optimization techniques are valid for RLLM. Our main
takeaways are that model quantization methods and speculative decoding can
improve service system efficiency with small compromise to RLLM accuracy, while
prefix caching, KV cache quantization may even degrade accuracy or serving
performance for small RLLM. Lastly, we conduct evaluation under real world
workload modeled by Gamma distribution to verify our findings. Empirical
results of real world workload evaluation across different dataset are aligned
with our main findings regarding RLLM serving. We hope our work can provide the
research community and industry with insights to advance RLLM inference
serving.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A task-agnostic multi-teacher distillation framework using a majority vote objective that leverages teacher diversity to create enriched representations without task-specific labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-teacher distillation methods are often task-specific, while diverse embedding models capture unique input aspects that could be better leveraged in a task-agnostic way.

Method: Proposes a majority vote objective function bounded by mutual information between student and teachers' embeddings, creating a task-agnostic distillation loss that doesn't require task-specific labels.

Result: Effective across text, vision, and molecular modeling domains, producing representations that improve performance on various downstream tasks including classification, clustering, and regression.

Conclusion: The framework successfully leverages teacher diversity to create enhanced embedding models that boost downstream task performance across multiple modalities without task-specific requirements.

Abstract: Casting complex inputs into tractable representations is a critical step
across various fields. Diverse embedding models emerge from differences in
architectures, loss functions, input modalities and datasets, each capturing
unique aspects of the input. Multi-teacher distillation leverages this
diversity to enrich representations but often remains tailored to specific
tasks. In this paper, we introduce a task-agnostic framework based on a
``majority vote" objective function. We demonstrate that this function is
bounded by the mutual information between student and teachers' embeddings,
leading to a task-agnostic distillation loss that eliminates dependence on
task-specific labels or prior knowledge. Our evaluations across text, vision
models, and molecular modeling show that our method effectively leverages
teacher diversity, resulting in representations enabling better performance for
a wide range of downstream tasks such as classification, clustering, or
regression. Additionally, we train and release state-of-the-art embedding
models, enhancing downstream performance in various modalities.

### [255] [Reinforcement Learning with Imperfect Transition Predictions: A Bellman-Jensen Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18687)
*Chenbei Lu,Zaiwei Chen,Tongxin Li,Chenye Wu,Adam Wierman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new RL framework that leverages multi-step predictions to improve decision-making in real-world applications like energy management and stock investment, addressing the curse of dimensionality through Bayesian value functions and a novel two-stage algorithm called BOLA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL assumes one-step transitions, but many real-world applications provide multi-step predictions of future states. However, naively incorporating these predictions leads to exponential state space growth and the curse of dimensionality. Existing RL theory lacks tools to analyze prediction-augmented MDPs with imperfect predictions.

Method: Three key innovations: 1) Bayesian value function to characterize optimal prediction-aware policy, 2) Bellman-Jensen Gap analysis for imperfect predictions, 3) BOLA algorithm - a two-stage model-based RL that separates offline Bayesian value learning from lightweight online adaptation to real-time predictions.

Result: The authors prove that BOLA remains sample-efficient even under imperfect predictions. The method is validated on synthetic MDPs and a real-world wind energy storage control problem, demonstrating effectiveness in handling multi-step predictions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the challenges of incorporating multi-step predictions in RL, providing both theoretical guarantees and practical algorithms that maintain efficiency even with imperfect predictions, making it suitable for real-world applications like energy management.

Abstract: Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) assumes the agents make decisions
based on Markov decision processes (MDPs) with one-step transition models. In
many real-world applications, such as energy management and stock investment,
agents can access multi-step predictions of future states, which provide
additional advantages for decision making. However, multi-step predictions are
inherently high-dimensional: naively embedding these predictions into an MDP
leads to an exponential blow-up in state space and the curse of dimensionality.
Moreover, existing RL theory provides few tools to analyze prediction-augmented
MDPs, as it typically works on one-step transition kernels and cannot
accommodate multi-step predictions with errors or partial action-coverage. We
address these challenges with three key innovations: First, we propose the
\emph{Bayesian value function} to characterize the optimal prediction-aware
policy tractably. Second, we develop a novel \emph{Bellman-Jensen Gap} analysis
on the Bayesian value function, which enables characterizing the value of
imperfect predictions. Third, we introduce BOLA (Bayesian Offline Learning with
Online Adaptation), a two-stage model-based RL algorithm that separates offline
Bayesian value learning from lightweight online adaptation to real-time
predictions. We prove that BOLA remains sample-efficient even under imperfect
predictions. We validate our theory and algorithm on synthetic MDPs and a
real-world wind energy storage control problem.

### [256] [OmniCast: A Masked Latent Diffusion Model for Weather Forecasting Across Time Scales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18707)
*Tung Nguyen,Tuan Pham,Troy Arcomano,Veerabhadra Kotamarthi,Ian Foster,Sandeep Madireddy,Aditya Grover*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OmniCast is a unified probabilistic weather forecasting model that uses VAE encoding and diffusion-based transformers to generate accurate forecasts across multiple timescales, achieving state-of-the-art performance while being significantly faster than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data-driven weather forecasting methods struggle at longer subseasonal-to-seasonal horizons due to error accumulation in autoregressive approaches, creating a need for more scalable and skillful probabilistic models.

Method: OmniCast combines a VAE model that encodes weather data into a lower-dimensional latent space with a diffusion-based transformer that generates future latent tokens. During training, it masks random future tokens and trains the transformer to estimate their distribution. During inference, it generates sequences by iteratively unmasking random token subsets.

Result: OmniCast performs competitively with leading probabilistic methods at medium-range timescales while being 10x-20x faster, achieves state-of-the-art performance at subseasonal-to-seasonal scales across multiple metrics, and can generate stable rollouts up to 100 years ahead.

Conclusion: The proposed unified probabilistic model successfully addresses error accumulation issues in autoregressive approaches and enables accurate weather forecasting across multiple timescales with improved efficiency and stability.

Abstract: Accurate weather forecasting across time scales is critical for anticipating
and mitigating the impacts of climate change. Recent data-driven methods based
on deep learning have achieved significant success in the medium range, but
struggle at longer subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) horizons due to error
accumulation in their autoregressive approach. In this work, we propose
OmniCast, a scalable and skillful probabilistic model that unifies weather
forecasting across timescales. OmniCast consists of two components: a VAE model
that encodes raw weather data into a continuous, lower-dimensional latent
space, and a diffusion-based transformer model that generates a sequence of
future latent tokens given the initial conditioning tokens. During training, we
mask random future tokens and train the transformer to estimate their
distribution given conditioning and visible tokens using a per-token diffusion
head. During inference, the transformer generates the full sequence of future
tokens by iteratively unmasking random subsets of tokens. This joint sampling
across space and time mitigates compounding errors from autoregressive
approaches. The low-dimensional latent space enables modeling long sequences of
future latent states, allowing the transformer to learn weather dynamics beyond
initial conditions. OmniCast performs competitively with leading probabilistic
methods at the medium-range timescale while being 10x to 20x faster, and
achieves state-of-the-art performance at the subseasonal-to-seasonal scale
across accuracy, physics-based, and probabilistic metrics. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that OmniCast can generate stable rollouts up to 100 years ahead.

### [257] [Preference-based Reinforcement Learning beyond Pairwise Comparisons: Benefits of Multiple Options](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18713)
*Joongkyu Lee,Seouh-won Yi,Min-hwan Oh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes M-AUPO, an algorithm for online preference-based reinforcement learning with ranking feedback that achieves improved sample efficiency by using larger action subsets, with theoretical guarantees showing direct performance improvement with subset size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PbRL works focus on pairwise comparisons or fail to leverage richer ranking feedback effectively, with performance not improving or even deteriorating as feedback length increases despite the availability of more information.

Method: Adopts the Plackett-Luce model for ranking feedback and proposes M-AUPO algorithm that selects multiple actions by maximizing average uncertainty within the offered subset.

Result: M-AUPO achieves a suboptimality gap of Õ(d/T √(∑_{t=1}^T 1/|S_t|)), showing larger subsets directly improve performance and avoiding exponential dependence on unknown parameter's norm.

Conclusion: This is the first theoretical result in PbRL with ranking feedback that explicitly demonstrates improved sample efficiency as a function of subset size, with matching lower bounds confirming the analysis.

Abstract: We study online preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) with the goal
of improving sample efficiency. While a growing body of theoretical work has
emerged-motivated by PbRL's recent empirical success, particularly in aligning
large language models (LLMs)-most existing studies focus only on pairwise
comparisons. A few recent works (Zhu et al., 2023, Mukherjee et al., 2024,
Thekumparampil et al., 2024) have explored using multiple comparisons and
ranking feedback, but their performance guarantees fail to improve-and can even
deteriorate-as the feedback length increases, despite the richer information
available. To address this gap, we adopt the Plackett-Luce (PL) model for
ranking feedback over action subsets and propose M-AUPO, an algorithm that
selects multiple actions by maximizing the average uncertainty within the
offered subset. We prove that M-AUPO achieves a suboptimality gap of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( \frac{d}{T} \sqrt{ \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{1}{|S_t|}}
\right)$, where $T$ is the total number of rounds, $d$ is the feature
dimension, and $|S_t|$ is the size of the subset at round $t$. This result
shows that larger subsets directly lead to improved performance and, notably,
the bound avoids the exponential dependence on the unknown parameter's norm,
which was a fundamental limitation in most previous works. Moreover, we
establish a near-matching lower bound of $\Omega \left( \frac{d}{K \sqrt{T}}
\right)$, where $K$ is the maximum subset size. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first theoretical result in PbRL with ranking feedback that
explicitly shows improved sample efficiency as a function of the subset size.

*Harry Amad,Zhaozhi Qian,Dennis Frauen,Julianna Piskorz,Stefan Feuerriegel,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STEAM is a novel method for generating synthetic medical data that preserves causal relationships for treatment effect analysis, outperforming existing generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world medical datasets are difficult to access due to regulatory barriers, making synthetic data valuable for causal inference and treatment effect analysis, but existing methods don't address the unique challenges of downstream causal inference tasks.

Method: Proposed STEAM method that mimics the data-generating process of treatment data and optimizes for three desiderata: preservation of covariate distribution, treatment assignment mechanism, and outcome generation mechanism.

Result: STEAM achieves state-of-the-art performance across evaluation metrics compared to existing generative models, particularly as the complexity of the true data-generating process increases.

Conclusion: STEAM provides an effective approach for generating synthetic medical data that maintains causal relationships necessary for treatment effect analysis, addressing key limitations of existing generative models.

Abstract: Causal inference is essential for developing and evaluating medical
interventions, yet real-world medical datasets are often difficult to access
due to regulatory barriers. This makes synthetic data a potentially valuable
asset that enables these medical analyses, along with the development of new
inference methods themselves. Generative models can produce synthetic data that
closely approximate real data distributions, yet existing methods do not
consider the unique challenges that downstream causal inference tasks, and
specifically those focused on treatments, pose. We establish a set of
desiderata that synthetic data containing treatments should satisfy to maximise
downstream utility: preservation of (i) the covariate distribution, (ii) the
treatment assignment mechanism, and (iii) the outcome generation mechanism.
Based on these desiderata, we propose a set of evaluation metrics to assess
such synthetic data. Finally, we present STEAM: a novel method for generating
Synthetic data for Treatment Effect Analysis in Medicine that mimics the
data-generating process of data containing treatments and optimises for our
desiderata. We empirically demonstrate that STEAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance across our metrics as compared to existing generative models,
particularly as the complexity of the true data-generating process increases.

TL;DR: L2O-CFGD meta-learns dynamic hyperparameter tuning for Caputo Fractional Gradient Descent to overcome convergence and hyperparameter selection challenges in non-convex optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fractional Gradient Descent shows promise for accelerating optimization but faces significant challenges with convergence behavior and hyperparameter selection, especially in non-convex settings like neural network training.

Method: Proposed Learning to Optimize Caputo Fractional Gradient Descent (L2O-CFGD), which meta-learns how to dynamically tune the hyperparameters of Caputo FGD.

Result: The meta-learned schedule outperforms CFGD with static hyperparameters found through extensive search, and achieves performance comparable to fully black-box meta-learned optimizers in some tasks.

Conclusion: L2O-CFGD serves as a powerful tool for identifying high-performing hyperparameters and gaining insights on leveraging the history-dependence of fractional differential in optimization.

Abstract: Fractional Gradient Descent (FGD) offers a novel and promising way to
accelerate optimization by incorporating fractional calculus into machine
learning. Although FGD has shown encouraging initial results across various
optimization tasks, it faces significant challenges with convergence behavior
and hyperparameter selection. Moreover, the impact of its hyperparameters is
not fully understood, and scheduling them is particularly difficult in
non-convex settings such as neural network training. To address these issues,
we propose a novel approach called Learning to Optimize Caputo Fractional
Gradient Descent (L2O-CFGD), which meta-learns how to dynamically tune the
hyperparameters of Caputo FGD (CFGD). Our method's meta-learned schedule
outperforms CFGD with static hyperparameters found through an extensive search
and, in some tasks, achieves performance comparable to a fully black-box
meta-learned optimizer. L2O-CFGD can thus serve as a powerful tool for
researchers to identify high-performing hyperparameters and gain insights on
how to leverage the history-dependence of the fractional differential in
optimization.

*Soroush Tabesh,Mher Safaryan,Dan Alistarh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAGE is a new QAT method that uses curvature-aware gradient estimation to reduce the accuracy gap between quantization-aware training and native training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is still a large accuracy gap between low-bit quantization-aware training techniques and native training that needs to be addressed.

Method: CAGE augments the straight-through estimator gradient with a curvature-aware correction derived from a multi-objective view of QAT, balancing loss minimization with quantization constraints.

Result: CAGE recovers over 10% of the quantization-induced loss increase in W4A4 regime when pre-training Llama-style models up to 800M parameters, outperforming outlier-mitigation methods.

Conclusion: Curvature-aware gradient corrections can bridge the remaining performance gap beyond current outlier-handling methods in quantization-aware training.

Abstract: Despite significant work on low-bit quantization-aware training (QAT), there
is still a large accuracy gap between such techniques and native training. To
address this, we introduce CAGE (Curvature-Aware Gradient Estimation), a new
QAT method that augments the straight-through estimator (STE) gradient with a
curvature-aware correction designed to counteract the loss increase induced by
quantization. CAGE is derived from a multi-objective view of QAT that balances
loss minimization with adherence to quantization constraints, yielding a
principled correction term that depends on local curvature information. On the
theoretical side, we introduce the notion of Pareto-optimal solutions for
quantized optimization, and establish that CAGE yields strong convergence
guarantees in the smooth non-convex setting. In terms of implementation, our
approach is optimizer-agnostic, but we provide a highly-efficient
implementation that leverages Adam statistics. When pre-training Llama-style
models of up to 800M-parameters, CAGE recovers over 10% of the
quantization-induced loss increase in the W4A4 regime over outlier-mitigation
methods. These results indicate that curvature-aware gradient corrections can
bridge the remaining performance gap beyond current outlier-handling methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SB-SETM is an online topic model that extends ETM to handle data streams by merging models from successive document batches, automatically inferring active topics and using optimal transport for topic embedding merging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online topic models are needed for real-world data streams but receive less attention than offline models due to additional challenges like evolving topics over time.

Method: Extends Embedded Topic Model (ETM) with truncated stick-breaking for topic-per-document distribution to infer active topics automatically, and uses continuous optimal transport for merging topic embeddings across batches.

Result: Outperforms baselines on simulated scenarios and extensively tested on real-world news corpus covering Russian-Ukrainian war (2022-2023).

Conclusion: SB-SETM successfully addresses challenges of online topic modeling and demonstrates effectiveness on both simulated and real-world streaming data.

Abstract: Online topic models are unsupervised algorithms to identify latent topics in
data streams that continuously evolve over time. Although these methods
naturally align with real-world scenarios, they have received considerably less
attention from the community compared to their offline counterparts, due to
specific additional challenges. To tackle these issues, we present SB-SETM, an
innovative model extending the Embedded Topic Model (ETM) to process data
streams by merging models formed on successive partial document batches. To
this end, SB-SETM (i) leverages a truncated stick-breaking construction for the
topic-per-document distribution, enabling the model to automatically infer from
the data the appropriate number of active topics at each timestep; and (ii)
introduces a merging strategy for topic embeddings based on a continuous
formulation of optimal transport adapted to the high dimensionality of the
latent topic space. Numerical experiments show SB-SETM outperforming baselines
on simulated scenarios. We extensively test it on a real-world corpus of news
articles covering the Russian-Ukrainian war throughout 2022-2023.

*Marc Gong Bacvanski,Liu Ziyin,Tomaso Poggio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A continuous-time neural model unifies biologically plausible learning algorithms without phase separation, showing that learning depends on temporal overlap between inputs and error signals, with robust learning requiring synaptic plasticity timescales to exceed stimulus duration by 1-2 orders of magnitude.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a continuous-time neural model that unifies biologically plausible learning algorithms and removes the need for separate inference and learning phases, addressing the gap between biological learning that unfolds continuously and most algorithmic models that rely on discrete updates.

Method: A continuous-time neural model that naturally emerges various learning rules (SGD, FA, DFA, KP) as limiting cases of the dynamics, analyzed through simulations and mathematical analysis to study learning under temporal mismatches and integration noise.

Result: Continuous-time networks stably learn at biological timescales, with learning depending on temporal overlap between inputs and error signals. Learning strength declines linearly with delay between input and error, and robust learning requires synaptic plasticity timescale to exceed stimulus duration by 1-2 orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: For typical cortical stimuli (tens of milliseconds), the functional plasticity window should be in the few-second range, identifying seconds-scale eligibility traces as necessary for error-driven learning in biological circuits.

Abstract: Biological learning unfolds continuously in time, yet most algorithmic models
rely on discrete updates and separate inference and learning phases. We study a
continuous-time neural model that unifies several biologically plausible
learning algorithms and removes the need for phase separation. Rules including
stochastic gradient descent (SGD), feedback alignment (FA), direct feedback
alignment (DFA), and Kolen-Pollack (KP) emerge naturally as limiting cases of
the dynamics. Simulations show that these continuous-time networks stably learn
at biological timescales, even under temporal mismatches and integration noise.
Through analysis and simulation, we show that learning depends on temporal
overlap: a synapse updates correctly only when its input and the corresponding
error signal coincide in time. When inputs are held constant, learning strength
declines linearly as the delay between input and error approaches the stimulus
duration, explaining observed robustness and failure across network depths.
Critically, robust learning requires the synaptic plasticity timescale to
exceed the stimulus duration by one to two orders of magnitude. For typical
cortical stimuli (tens of milliseconds), this places the functional plasticity
window in the few-second range, a testable prediction that identifies
seconds-scale eligibility traces as necessary for error-driven learning in
biological circuits.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes LRP's axiomatic soundness in Transformers, showing bilinear propagation rules violate implementation invariance and that bypassing softmax in CP-LRP improves alignment with LOO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine whether LRP can serve as an efficient alternative to computationally expensive LOO for feature importance in Transformers, given its axiomatic soundness remains under-examined.

Method: Analytical proof and empirical validation of bilinear propagation rule violations in linear attention layers, plus revisiting CP-LRP with modified relevance propagation bypassing softmax layers.

Result: Bilinear propagation rules violate implementation invariance axiom; bypassing softmax in CP-LRP significantly improves alignment with LOO, especially in middle-to-late Transformer layers.

Conclusion: Bilinear factorization sensitivity and softmax propagation error jointly undermine LRP's ability to approximate LOO in Transformers.

Abstract: Leave-One-Out (LOO) provides an intuitive measure of feature importance but
is computationally prohibitive. While Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP)
offers a potentially efficient alternative, its axiomatic soundness in modern
Transformers remains largely under-examined. In this work, we first show that
the bilinear propagation rules used in recent advances of AttnLRP violate the
implementation invariance axiom. We prove this analytically and confirm it
empirically in linear attention layers. Second, we also revisit CP-LRP as a
diagnostic baseline and find that bypassing relevance propagation through the
softmax layer -- backpropagating relevance only through the value matrices --
significantly improves alignment with LOO, particularly in middle-to-late
Transformer layers. Overall, our results suggest that (i) bilinear
factorization sensitivity and (ii) softmax propagation error potentially
jointly undermine LRP's ability to approximate LOO in Transformers.

TL;DR: This review provides a unified perspective on iterative optimization in AI, bridging gradient-based methods with derivative-free approaches and connecting them to neural network training and biological learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand adaptive systems through optimization frameworks, address scalability limitations of gradient-based methods, and explore biologically plausible learning mechanisms.

Method: Categorizes optimization approaches by derivative order (first-, second-, higher-order to zeroth-order), analyzes neural network training adaptations, and applies optimization lens to biological learning.

Result: Modern zeroth-order methods can effectively approximate gradients and achieve BP-competitive performance in neural networks, while providing principled framework for understanding biological learning.

Conclusion: ZO optimization offers biologically plausible framework that leverages intrinsic noise as computational resource, with implications for neuromorphic hardware and energy-efficient AI systems.

Abstract: Iterative optimization is central to modern artificial intelligence (AI) and
provides a crucial framework for understanding adaptive systems. This review
provides a unified perspective on this subject, bridging classic theory with
neural network training and biological learning. Although gradient-based
methods, powered by the efficient but biologically implausible backpropagation
(BP), dominate machine learning, their computational demands can hinder
scalability in high-dimensional settings. In contrast, derivative-free or
zeroth-order (ZO) optimization feature computationally lighter approaches that
rely only on function evaluations and randomness. While generally less sample
efficient, recent breakthroughs demonstrate that modern ZO methods can
effectively approximate gradients and achieve performance competitive with BP
in neural network models. This ZO paradigm is also particularly relevant for
biology. Its core principles of random exploration (probing) and
feedback-guided adaptation (reinforcing) parallel key mechanisms of biological
learning, offering a mathematically principled perspective on how the brain
learns. In this review, we begin by categorizing optimization approaches based
on the order of derivative information they utilize, ranging from first-,
second-, and higher-order gradient-based to ZO methods. We then explore how
these methods are adapted to the unique challenges of neural network training
and the resulting learning dynamics. Finally, we build upon these insights to
view biological learning through an optimization lens, arguing that a ZO
paradigm leverages the brain's intrinsic noise as a computational resource.
This framework not only illuminates our understanding of natural intelligence
but also holds vast implications for neuromorphic hardware, helping us design
fast and energy-efficient AI systems that exploit intrinsic hardware noise.

Motivation: To develop an efficient alternative to complex, reward-based training paradigms like reinforcement learning for improving LLM reasoning capabilities.

Method: A self-help online supervised finetuning paradigm where the model generates responses and is immediately finetuned on its own generated data using just one rollout by default, without requiring external rewards.

Result: OSFT achieves downstream performance on challenging mathematical reasoning tasks comparable to strong reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) methods like GRPO, demonstrating efficiency and robustness.

Conclusion: OSFT offers an efficient and promising alternative to more complex, reward-based training paradigms by facilitating the model's existing latent knowledge from pretraining to improve reasoning ability.

Abstract: We present a simple, self-help online supervised finetuning (OSFT) paradigm
for LLM reasoning. In this paradigm, the model generates its own responses and
is immediately finetuned on this self-generated data. OSFT is a highly
efficient training strategy for LLM reasoning, as it is reward-free and uses
just one rollout by default. Experiment results show that OSFT achieves
downstream performance on challenging mathematical reasoning tasks comparable
to strong reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) methods such as
GRPO. Our ablation study further demonstrates the efficiency and robustness of
OSFT. The major mechanism of OSFT lies in facilitating the model's own existing
preference (latent knowledge) learned from pretraining, which leads to
reasoning ability improvement. We believe that OSFT offers an efficient and
promising alternative to more complex, reward-based training paradigms. Our

TL;DR: Search Self-Play (SSP) enables LLM agents to co-evolve through self-generated tasks with controlled difficulty, eliminating the need for human supervision in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RLVR requires massive human effort for task queries and ground-truth answers, hindering scalability in agentic scenarios. Existing task synthesis methods struggle with controlling task difficulty for effective RL training.

Method: Self-play training where LLM acts as both task proposer and problem solver. The proposer generates deep search queries with increasing difficulty and verifiable answers using retrieval-augmentation generation (RAG) to ensure accuracy.

Result: SSP significantly improves search agents' performance uniformly across various benchmarks without supervision, working effectively in both from-scratch and continuous RL training setups.

Conclusion: SSP provides a scalable approach for agentic RLVR through self-play co-evolution, eliminating dependency on human supervision while maintaining training effectiveness.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become the
mainstream technique for training LLM agents. However, RLVR highly depends on
well-crafted task queries and corresponding ground-truth answers to provide
accurate rewards, which requires massive human efforts and hinders the RL
scaling processes, especially under agentic scenarios. Although a few recent
works explore task synthesis methods, the difficulty of generated agentic tasks
can hardly be controlled to provide effective RL training advantages. To
achieve agentic RLVR with higher scalability, we explore self-play training for
deep search agents, in which the learning LLM utilizes multi-turn search engine
calling and acts simultaneously as both a task proposer and a problem solver.
The task proposer aims to generate deep search queries with well-defined
ground-truth answers and increasing task difficulty. The problem solver tries
to handle the generated search queries and output the correct answer
predictions. To ensure that each generated search query has accurate ground
truth, we collect all the searching results from the proposer's trajectory as
external knowledge, then conduct retrieval-augmentation generation (RAG) to
test whether the proposed query can be correctly answered with all necessary
search documents provided. In this search self-play (SSP) game, the proposer
and the solver co-evolve their agent capabilities through both competition and
cooperation. With substantial experimental results, we find that SSP can
significantly improve search agents' performance uniformly on various
benchmarks without any supervision under both from-scratch and continuous RL
training setups. The code is at https://github.com/Alibaba-Quark/SSP.

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{BO4Mob}, a new benchmark framework for high-dimensional

Motivation: Traditional value-based methods are limited to discrete action spaces, while actor-critic methods for continuous spaces suffer from training instability. There's a need for stable, purely value-based approaches for continuous control.

Method: Proposes an actor-free Q-learning framework with structural maximization of Q-functions, using key architectural and algorithmic choices to enable efficient learning in continuous action spaces without separate actor networks.

Result: Achieves performance and sample efficiency comparable to state-of-the-art baselines on standard simulation tasks, with particular advantages in constrained action spaces where value functions are non-smooth.

Conclusion: The actor-free Q-learning approach provides a stable and efficient alternative to actor-critic methods for continuous control, especially benefiting constrained action spaces through structural maximization.

Abstract: Value-based algorithms are a cornerstone of off-policy reinforcement learning
due to their simplicity and training stability. However, their use has
traditionally been restricted to discrete action spaces, as they rely on
estimating Q-values for individual state-action pairs. In continuous action
spaces, evaluating the Q-value over the entire action space becomes
computationally infeasible. To address this, actor-critic methods are typically
employed, where a critic is trained on off-policy data to estimate Q-values,
and an actor is trained to maximize the critic's output. Despite their
popularity, these methods often suffer from instability during training. In
this work, we propose a purely value-based framework for continuous control
that revisits structural maximization of Q-functions, introducing a set of key
architectural and algorithmic choices to enable efficient and stable learning.
We evaluate the proposed actor-free Q-learning approach on a range of standard
simulation tasks, demonstrating performance and sample efficiency on par with
state-of-the-art baselines, without the cost of learning a separate actor.
Particularly, in environments with constrained action spaces, where the value
functions are typically non-smooth, our method with structural maximization
outperforms traditional actor-critic methods with gradient-based maximization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge causal reasoning and predictive modeling for personalized healthcare, specifically addressing post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) in patients with pre-existing heart failure.

Method: Integrates regularized predictive modeling with counterfactual search using exact enumeration and optimization-based methods (NICE and MOC algorithms) to explore high-dimensional intervention spaces.

Result: Achieved strong discriminative performance (AUROC: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.84-0.91) on 2700+ patients, generating interpretable, patient-specific counterfactuals showing how modifying comorbidity patterns or treatments could alter outcomes.

Conclusion: Counterfactual reasoning can be formalized as an optimization problem over predictive functions, providing a rigorous, interpretable, and computationally efficient approach to personalized inference in complex biomedical systems.

Abstract: Counterfactual inference provides a mathematical framework for reasoning
about hypothetical outcomes under alternative interventions, bridging causal
reasoning and predictive modeling. We present a counterfactual inference
framework for individualized risk estimation and intervention analysis,
illustrated through a clinical application to post-acute sequelae of COVID-19
(PASC) among patients with pre-existing heart failure (HF). Using longitudinal
diagnosis, laboratory, and medication data from a large health-system cohort,
we integrate regularized predictive modeling with counterfactual search to
identify actionable pathways to PASC-related HF hospital admissions. The
framework combines exact enumeration with optimization-based methods, including
the Nearest Instance Counterfactual Explanations (NICE) and Multi-Objective
Counterfactuals (MOC) algorithms, to efficiently explore high-dimensional
intervention spaces. Applied to more than 2700 individuals with confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 infection and prior HF, the model achieved strong discriminative
performance (AUROC: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.84-0.91) and generated interpretable,
patient-specific counterfactuals that quantify how modifying comorbidity
patterns or treatment factors could alter predicted outcomes. This work
demonstrates how counterfactual reasoning can be formalized as an optimization
problem over predictive functions, offering a rigorous, interpretable, and
computationally efficient approach to personalized inference in complex
biomedical systems.

### [270] [Retaining by Doing: The Role of On-Policy Data in Mitigating Forgetting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18874)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RL causes less catastrophic forgetting than SFT in language model post-training while achieving similar or better target task performance, due to RL's mode-seeking nature from on-policy data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate catastrophic forgetting when adapting language models to new tasks through post-training methods.

Method: Systematic comparison of forgetting patterns between SFT and RL across different LM families and tasks, plus theoretical analysis using mixture models to explain the differences.

Result: RL consistently leads to less forgetting than SFT across all tested scenarios while maintaining comparable or superior target task performance.

Conclusion: RL's robustness to forgetting stems from its use of on-policy data, suggesting practical strategies for mitigating forgetting using approximately on-policy data.

Abstract: Adapting language models (LMs) to new tasks via post-training carries the
risk of degrading existing capabilities -- a phenomenon classically known as
catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, toward identifying guidelines for
mitigating this phenomenon, we systematically compare the forgetting patterns
of two widely adopted post-training methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement learning (RL). Our experiments reveal a consistent trend across
LM families (Llama, Qwen) and tasks (instruction following, general knowledge,
and arithmetic reasoning): RL leads to less forgetting than SFT while achieving
comparable or higher target task performance. To investigate the cause for this
difference, we consider a simplified setting in which the LM is modeled as a
mixture of two distributions, one corresponding to prior knowledge and the
other to the target task. We identify that the mode-seeking nature of RL, which
stems from its use of on-policy data, enables keeping prior knowledge intact
when learning the target task. We then verify this insight by demonstrating
that the use on-policy data underlies the robustness of RL to forgetting in
practical settings, as opposed to other algorithmic choices such as the KL
regularization or advantage estimation. Lastly, as a practical implication, our
results highlight the potential of mitigating forgetting using approximately
on-policy data, which can be substantially more efficient to obtain than fully
on-policy data.
