Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AI-powered system automates digitization of gas plant infrastructure by extracting structured design data and hierarchical frameworks from P&ID documents using OCR, Vision LLM, Object Detection, and a novel Transformer architecture for relational reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To streamline the digitization process of SNAM's gas infrastructure by automating the extraction of plant information from documentation, overcoming challenges from lack of standardization and reducing manual workload for MGM users.

Method: Combines OCR, Vision LLM, Object Detection, Relational Reasoning and optimization algorithms on P&ID documents. Introduces a new Transformer architecture for Scene Graph Generation to analyze complex relations between plant components.

Result: Achieved 91% accuracy in extracting textual design data, 93% accuracy in component identification, and approximately 80% accuracy in hierarchical structure extraction.

Conclusion: The synergistic AI approach successfully automates plant digitization with high accuracy, demonstrating the viability of AI solutions for energy infrastructure management despite data standardization challenges.

Abstract: The energy transition is a key theme of the last decades to determine a future of eco-sustainability, and an area of such importance cannot disregard digitization, innovation and the new technological tools available. This is the context in which the Generative Artificial Intelligence models described in this paper are positioned, developed by Engineering Ingegneria Informatica SpA in order to automate the plant structures acquisition of SNAM energy infrastructure, a leading gas transportation company in Italy and Europe. The digitization of a gas plant consists in registering all its relevant information through the interpretation of the related documentation. The aim of this work is therefore to design an effective solution based on Artificial Intelligence techniques to automate the extraction of the information necessary for the digitization of a plant, in order to streamline the daily work of MGM users. The solution received the P&ID of the plant as input, each one in pdf format, and uses OCR, Vision LLM, Object Detection, Relational Reasoning and optimization algorithms to return an output consisting of two sets of information: a structured overview of the relevant design data and the hierarchical framework of the plant. To achieve convincing results, we extend a state-of-the-art model for Scene Graph Generation introducing a brand new Transformer architecture with the aim of deepening the analysis of the complex relations between the plant's components. The synergistic use of the listed AI-based technologies allowed to overcome many obstacles arising from the high variety of data, due to the lack of standardization. An accuracy of 91\% has been achieved in the extraction of textual information relating to design data. Regarding the plants topology, 93\% of components are correctly identified and the hierarchical structure is extracted with an accuracy around 80\%.

### [2] [Assessing Identity Leakage in Talking Face Generation: Metrics and Evaluation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08613)
*Dogucan Yaman,Fevziye Irem Eyiokur,Hazım Kemal Ekenel,Alexander Waibel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes systematic evaluation methodology to detect and quantify lip leakage in talking face generation models, using three test setups and derived metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inpainting-based talking face generation can introduce lip leaking where generated lips are influenced by reference images rather than driving audio, which is hard to detect with standard metrics.

Method: Uses three test setups: silent-input generation, mismatched audio-video pairing, and matched audio-video synthesis, with derived metrics like lip-sync discrepancy and silent-audio-based lip-sync scores.

Result: Provides framework to analyze how different identity reference selections affect leakage, offering insights into reference design.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology is model-agnostic and establishes a more reliable benchmark for future research in talking face generation.

Abstract: Inpainting-based talking face generation aims to preserve video details such as pose, lighting, and gestures while modifying only lip motion, often using an identity reference image to maintain speaker consistency. However, this mechanism can introduce lip leaking, where generated lips are influenced by the reference image rather than solely by the driving audio. Such leakage is difficult to detect with standard metrics and conventional test setup. To address this, we propose a systematic evaluation methodology to analyze and quantify lip leakage. Our framework employs three complementary test setups: silent-input generation, mismatched audio-video pairing, and matched audio-video synthesis. We also introduce derived metrics including lip-sync discrepancy and silent-audio-based lip-sync scores. In addition, we study how different identity reference selections affect leakage, providing insights into reference design. The proposed methodology is model-agnostic and establishes a more reliable benchmark for future research in talking face generation.

### [3] [A Multi-Drone Multi-View Dataset and Deep Learning Framework for Pedestrian Detection and Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08615)
*Kosta Dakic,Kanchana Thilakarathna,Rodrigo N. Calheiros,Teng Joon Lim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MATRIX introduces a multi-drone surveillance dataset with dynamic camera positions and a deep learning framework for robust pedestrian tracking in complex urban environments with occlusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-drone surveillance systems struggle with dynamic camera positions and complex occlusions, limiting their effectiveness in real-world urban scenarios.

Method: Proposes a framework with real-time camera calibration, feature-based image registration, and multi-view feature fusion in bird's-eye-view representation for dynamic drone-based surveillance.

Result: Maintains ~90% detection/tracking accuracy and ~80% trajectory tracking in complex environments, significantly outperforming static camera methods which degrade in challenging conditions.

Conclusion: MATRIX dataset and framework provide essential benchmarks for advancing dynamic multi-view surveillance systems with demonstrated robustness and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Multi-drone surveillance systems offer enhanced coverage and robustness for pedestrian tracking, yet existing approaches struggle with dynamic camera positions and complex occlusions. This paper introduces MATRIX (Multi-Aerial TRacking In compleX environments), a comprehensive dataset featuring synchronized footage from eight drones with continuously changing positions, and a novel deep learning framework for multi-view detection and tracking. Unlike existing datasets that rely on static cameras or limited drone coverage, MATRIX provides a challenging scenario with 40 pedestrians and a significant architectural obstruction in an urban environment. Our framework addresses the unique challenges of dynamic drone-based surveillance through real-time camera calibration, feature-based image registration, and multi-view feature fusion in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation. Experimental results demonstrate that while static camera methods maintain over 90\% detection and tracking precision and accuracy metrics in a simplified MATRIX environment without an obstruction, 10 pedestrians and a much smaller observational area, their performance significantly degrades in the complex environment. Our proposed approach maintains robust performance with $\sim$90\% detection and tracking accuracy, as well as successfully tracks $\sim$80\% of trajectories under challenging conditions. Transfer learning experiments reveal strong generalization capabilities, with the pretrained model achieving much higher detection and tracking accuracy performance compared to training the model from scratch. Additionally, systematic camera dropout experiments reveal graceful performance degradation, demonstrating practical robustness for real-world deployments where camera failures may occur. The MATRIX dataset and framework provide essential benchmarks for advancing dynamic multi-view surveillance systems.

### [4] [Learning Topology-Driven Multi-Subspace Fusion for Grassmannian Deep Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08628)
*Xuan Yu,Tianyang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A topology-driven multi-subspace fusion framework on Grassmannian manifold that enables adaptive subspace collaboration through dynamic subspace selection and Fréchet mean optimization, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Grassmannian approaches rely on static single-subspace representations, neglecting the dynamic interplay between multiple subspaces critical for capturing complex geometric structures.

Method: Proposes adaptive multi-subspace modeling with topological convergence analysis for dynamic subspace selection/weighting, and multi-subspace interaction blocks using Fréchet mean optimization on the manifold, enhanced with Riemannian batch normalization and mutual information regularization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D action recognition (HDM05, FPHA), EEG classification (MAMEM-SSVEPII), and graph tasks, demonstrating superior discriminability and interpretability.

Conclusion: Successfully adapts multi-channel interaction philosophy from Euclidean networks to non-Euclidean domains, advancing geometric deep learning with improved subspace collaboration and theoretical convergence guarantees.

Abstract: Grassmannian manifold offers a powerful carrier for geometric representation learning by modelling high-dimensional data as low-dimensional subspaces. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on static single-subspace representations, neglecting the dynamic interplay between multiple subspaces critical for capturing complex geometric structures. To address this limitation, we propose a topology-driven multi-subspace fusion framework that enables adaptive subspace collaboration on the Grassmannian. Our solution introduces two key innovations: (1) Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, an adaptive multi-subspace modelling mechanism is proposed that dynamically selects and weights task-relevant subspaces via topological convergence analysis, and (2) a multi-subspace interaction block that fuses heterogeneous geometric representations through Fréchet mean optimisation on the manifold. Theoretically, we establish the convergence guarantees of adaptive subspaces under a projection metric topology, ensuring stable gradient-based optimisation. Practically, we integrate Riemannian batch normalisation and mutual information regularisation to enhance discriminability and robustness. Extensive experiments on 3D action recognition (HDM05, FPHA), EEG classification (MAMEM-SSVEPII), and graph tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Our work not only advances geometric deep learning but also successfully adapts the proven multi-channel interaction philosophy of Euclidean networks to non-Euclidean domains, achieving superior discriminability and interpretability.

### [5] [Time-to-Move: Training-Free Motion Controlled Video Generation via Dual-Clock Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08633)
*Assaf Singer,Noam Rotstein,Amir Mann,Ron Kimmel,Or Litany*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TTM is a training-free framework for motion-controlled video generation that uses crude reference animations as motion cues, enabling precise appearance and motion control without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based video generation lacks precise motion control, and current motion-conditioned methods require expensive model-specific fine-tuning.

Method: Uses crude reference animations from user manipulations as motion cues, adapts SDEdit mechanism to video domain, employs dual-clock denoising for region-dependent alignment, and preserves appearance with image conditioning.

Result: TTM matches or exceeds training-based baselines in realism and motion control on object and camera motion benchmarks, while enabling precise pixel-level appearance control.

Conclusion: TTM provides a plug-and-play solution for motion- and appearance-controlled video generation without additional training, offering superior control capabilities compared to text-only methods.

Abstract: Diffusion-based video generation can create realistic videos, yet existing image- and text-based conditioning fails to offer precise motion control. Prior methods for motion-conditioned synthesis typically require model-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and restrictive. We introduce Time-to-Move (TTM), a training-free, plug-and-play framework for motion- and appearance-controlled video generation with image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models. Our key insight is to use crude reference animations obtained through user-friendly manipulations such as cut-and-drag or depth-based reprojection. Motivated by SDEdit's use of coarse layout cues for image editing, we treat the crude animations as coarse motion cues and adapt the mechanism to the video domain. We preserve appearance with image conditioning and introduce dual-clock denoising, a region-dependent strategy that enforces strong alignment in motion-specified regions while allowing flexibility elsewhere, balancing fidelity to user intent with natural dynamics. This lightweight modification of the sampling process incurs no additional training or runtime cost and is compatible with any backbone. Extensive experiments on object and camera motion benchmarks show that TTM matches or exceeds existing training-based baselines in realism and motion control. Beyond this, TTM introduces a unique capability: precise appearance control through pixel-level conditioning, exceeding the limits of text-only prompting.

### [6] [CADIC: Continual Anomaly Detection Based on Incremental Coreset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08634)
*Gen Yang,Zhipeng Deng,Junfeng Man*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a unified memory bank framework for continual anomaly detection that shares memory across tasks instead of using task-specific sub-memory banks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing continual anomaly detection methods require constructing class-specific sub-memory banks for each task, which limits flexibility and scalability in dynamic data distribution scenarios.

Method: Uses a unified memory bank shared by all tasks with incremental embedding updates in a fixed-size coreset, enabling continuous knowledge acquisition without task-specific memory fragmentation. Anomaly detection via nearest-neighbor matching.

Result: Achieves average image-level AUROC scores of 0.972 on MVTec AD and 0.891 on Visa datasets, outperforming existing baselines. Demonstrates 100% accuracy on real-world electronic paper dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed unified memory bank framework effectively addresses scalability limitations of existing methods while maintaining high detection accuracy across various datasets, confirming robustness in practical applications.

Abstract: The primary objective of Continual Anomaly Detection (CAD) is to learn the normal patterns of new tasks under dynamic data distribution assumptions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Existing embedding-based CAD approaches continuously update a memory bank with new embeddings to adapt to sequential tasks. However, these methods require constructing class-specific sub-memory banks for each task, which restricts their flexibility and scalability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CAD framework where all tasks share a unified memory bank. During training, the method incrementally updates embeddings within a fixed-size coreset, enabling continuous knowledge acquisition from sequential tasks without task-specific memory fragmentation. In the inference phase, anomaly scores are computed via a nearest-neighbor matching mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art detection accuracy. We validate the method through comprehensive experiments on MVTec AD and Visa datasets. Results show that our approach outperforms existing baselines, achieving average image-level AUROC scores of 0.972 (MVTec AD) and 0.891 (Visa). Notably, on a real-world electronic paper dataset, it demonstrates 100% accuracy in anomaly sample detection, confirming its robustness in practical scenarios. The implementation will be open-sourced on GitHub.

### [7] [Predict and Resist: Long-Term Accident Anticipation under Sensor Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08640)
*Xingcheng Liu,Bin Rao,Yanchen Guan,Chengyue Wang,Haicheng Liao,Jiaxun Zhang,Chengyu Lin,Meixin Zhu,Zhenning Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified framework combining diffusion-based denoising with time-aware actor-critic model for robust accident anticipation in autonomous driving, addressing sensor noise and timing challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address two key challenges in real-world accident anticipation: noisy/degraded sensory inputs from weather, motion blur, or hardware limitations, and the need for timely yet reliable predictions that balance early alerts with false-alarm suppression.

Method: Integrates diffusion-based denoising with time-aware actor-critic model. Diffusion module reconstructs noise-resilient features through iterative refinement. Actor-critic architecture uses long-horizon temporal reasoning and time-weighted rewards to determine optimal alert timing.

Result: State-of-the-art accuracy on three benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D) with significant gains in mean time-to-accident. Maintains robust performance under Gaussian and impulse noise. Produces earlier, more stable, and human-aligned predictions in both routine and complex traffic scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates potential for real-world, safety-critical deployment by effectively addressing sensor degradation and timing challenges in accident anticipation for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Accident anticipation is essential for proactive and safe autonomous driving, where even a brief advance warning can enable critical evasive actions. However, two key challenges hinder real-world deployment: (1) noisy or degraded sensory inputs from weather, motion blur, or hardware limitations, and (2) the need to issue timely yet reliable predictions that balance early alerts with false-alarm suppression. We propose a unified framework that integrates diffusion-based denoising with a time-aware actor-critic model to address these challenges. The diffusion module reconstructs noise-resilient image and object features through iterative refinement, preserving critical motion and interaction cues under sensor degradation. In parallel, the actor-critic architecture leverages long-horizon temporal reasoning and time-weighted rewards to determine the optimal moment to raise an alert, aligning early detection with reliability. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D) demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and significant gains in mean time-to-accident, while maintaining robust performance under Gaussian and impulse noise. Qualitative analyses further show that our model produces earlier, more stable, and human-aligned predictions in both routine and highly complex traffic scenarios, highlighting its potential for real-world, safety-critical deployment.

### [8] [RS-Net: Context-Aware Relation Scoring for Dynamic Scene Graph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08651)
*Hae-Won Jo,Yeong-Jun Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RS-Net is a modular framework that scores object pair relations using spatial and temporal context to improve dynamic scene graph generation by addressing the challenge of identifying meaningful relations from non-related pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DSGG methods lack guidance for non-related object pairs, making it difficult to identify meaningful relations during inference since they are trained only on annotated object pairs.

Method: Proposes Relation Scoring Network (RS-Net) with spatial context encoder using learnable context tokens and temporal encoder for video-level aggregation, integrated into unified triplet scoring mechanism.

Result: Experiments on Action Genome dataset show consistent improvements in Recall and Precision across baselines, with notable gains in mean Recall, addressing long-tailed relation distribution while maintaining competitive efficiency.

Conclusion: RS-Net effectively enhances relation prediction in DSGG by scoring contextual importance of object pairs and can be easily integrated into existing models without architectural changes, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Dynamic Scene Graph Generation (DSGG) models how object relations evolve over time in videos. However, existing methods are trained only on annotated object pairs and lack guidance for non-related pairs, making it difficult to identify meaningful relations during inference. In this paper, we propose Relation Scoring Network (RS-Net), a modular framework that scores the contextual importance of object pairs using both spatial interactions and long-range temporal context. RS-Net consists of a spatial context encoder with learnable context tokens and a temporal encoder that aggregates video-level information. The resulting relation scores are integrated into a unified triplet scoring mechanism to enhance relation prediction. RS-Net can be easily integrated into existing DSGG models without architectural changes. Experiments on the Action Genome dataset show that RS-Net consistently improves both Recall and Precision across diverse baselines, with notable gains in mean Recall, highlighting its ability to address the long-tailed distribution of relations. Despite the increased number of parameters, RS-Net maintains competitive efficiency, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

### [9] [Privacy Beyond Pixels: Latent Anonymization for Privacy-Preserving Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08666)
*Joseph Fioresi,Ishan Rajendrakumar Dave,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight Anonymizing Adapter Module (AAM) that removes private information from video features in latent space while maintaining task utility, achieving 35% privacy leakage reduction without retraining foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video foundation models' spatio-temporal features inadvertently reveal sensitive personal information (skin color, gender, clothing), and current pixel-level anonymization methods require retraining and are task-specific.

Method: Plug-and-play AAM module with three training objectives: clip-level self-supervised privacy objective, co-training for utility retention, and latent consistency loss for generalization to unseen tasks.

Result: 35% reduction in privacy leakage while maintaining near-baseline utility across Action Recognition, Temporal Action Detection, and Anomaly Detection tasks; effectively mitigates gender bias in action recognition.

Conclusion: The proposed latent-space privacy preservation framework successfully balances privacy protection with utility retention for video foundation models, offering a practical solution without requiring model retraining.

Abstract: We introduce a novel formulation of visual privacy preservation for video foundation models that operates entirely in the latent space. While spatio-temporal features learned by foundation models have deepened general understanding of video content, sharing or storing these extracted visual features for downstream tasks inadvertently reveals sensitive personal information like skin color, gender, or clothing. Current privacy preservation methods focus on input-pixel-level anonymization, which requires retraining the entire utility video model and results in task-specific anonymization, making them unsuitable for recent video foundational models. To address these challenges, we introduce a lightweight Anonymizing Adapter Module (AAM) that removes private information from video features while retaining general task utility. AAM can be applied in a plug-and-play fashion to frozen video encoders, minimizing the computational burden of finetuning and re-extracting features. Our framework employs three newly designed training objectives: (1) a clip-level self-supervised privacy objective to reduce mutual information between static clips, (2) a co-training objective to retain utility across seen tasks, and (3) a latent consistency loss for generalization on unseen tasks. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate a significant 35% reduction in privacy leakage while maintaining near-baseline utility performance across various downstream tasks: Action Recognition (Kinetics400, UCF101, HMDB51), Temporal Action Detection (THUMOS14), and Anomaly Detection (UCF-Crime). We also provide an analysis on anonymization for sensitive temporal attribute recognition. Additionally, we propose new protocols for assessing gender bias in action recognition models, showing that our method effectively mitigates such biases and promotes more equitable video understanding.

### [10] [Rethinking generative image pretraining: How far are we from scaling up next-pixel prediction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08704)
*Xinchen Yan,Chen Liang,Lijun Yu,Adams Wei Yu,Yifeng Lu,Quoc V. Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Autoregressive next-pixel prediction shows task-dependent scaling: generation requires 3-5x faster data growth than classification, and higher resolutions need model size to grow faster than data. Compute is the main bottleneck, not data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the scaling properties of autoregressive next-pixel prediction as a unified framework for vision models, understanding how different tasks (classification vs generation) scale with compute and resolution.

Method: Trained Transformers with IsoFlops profiles across compute budgets up to 7e19 FLOPs at resolutions starting from 32x32, evaluating next-pixel prediction, ImageNet classification, and generation quality via Fréchet Distance.

Result: Optimal scaling is task-dependent: generation requires data size to grow 3-5x faster than classification. Higher resolutions require model size to grow much faster than data size. Compute is the primary bottleneck.

Conclusion: Pixel-by-pixel modeling of images could be feasible within five years as compute continues growing 4-5x annually, with compute being the main constraint rather than training data availability.

Abstract: This paper investigates the scaling properties of autoregressive next-pixel prediction, a simple, end-to-end yet under-explored framework for unified vision models. Starting with images at resolutions of 32x32, we train a family of Transformers using IsoFlops profiles across compute budgets up to 7e19 FLOPs and evaluate three distinct target metrics: next-pixel prediction objective, ImageNet classification accuracy, and generation quality measured by Fr'echet Distance. First, optimal scaling strategy is critically task-dependent. At a fixed 32x32 resolution alone, the optimal scaling properties for image classification and image generation diverge, where generation optimal setup requires the data size grow three to five times faster than for the classification optimal setup. Second, as image resolution increases, the optimal scaling strategy indicates that the model size must grow much faster than data size. Surprisingly, by projecting our findings, we discover that the primary bottleneck is compute rather than the amount of training data. As compute continues to grow four to five times annually, we forecast the feasibility of pixel-by-pixel modeling of images within the next five years.

### [11] [Harnessing Diffusion-Generated Synthetic Images for Fair Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08711)
*Abhipsa Basu,Aviral Gupta,Abhijnya Bhat,R. Venkatesh Babu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using diffusion model finetuning techniques (LoRA and DreamBooth) to generate balanced training data that preserves original data distributions, addressing biases from uneven group representation in image classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address biases in image classification systems caused by uneven group representation in training data, where certain attributes become disproportionately associated with specific groups (e.g., blond hair with females).

Method: Uses multiple diffusion-finetuning techniques including LoRA and DreamBooth, with a clustering approach within groups to handle intra-group variations. Generates group-balanced data for pretraining followed by fine-tuning on real data.

Result: The finetuning approaches outperform vanilla Stable Diffusion and achieve comparable results to SOTA debiasing techniques like Group-DRO, while surpassing them as dataset bias severity increases.

Conclusion: Diffusion model finetuning techniques provide an effective approach for generating balanced training data that mitigates biases while preserving data distribution characteristics.

Abstract: Image classification systems often inherit biases from uneven group representation in training data. For example, in face datasets for hair color classification, blond hair may be disproportionately associated with females, reinforcing stereotypes. A recent approach leverages the Stable Diffusion model to generate balanced training data, but these models often struggle to preserve the original data distribution. In this work, we explore multiple diffusion-finetuning techniques, e.g., LoRA and DreamBooth, to generate images that more accurately represent each training group by learning directly from their samples. Additionally, in order to prevent a single DreamBooth model from being overwhelmed by excessive intra-group variations, we explore a technique of clustering images within each group and train a DreamBooth model per cluster. These models are then used to generate group-balanced data for pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the studied finetuning approaches outperform vanilla Stable Diffusion on average and achieve results comparable to SOTA debiasing techniques like Group-DRO, while surpassing them as the dataset bias severity increases.

### [13] [Adaptive graph Kolmogorov-Arnold network for 3D human pose estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08809)
*Abu Taib Mohammed Shahjahan,A. Ben Hamza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoseKAN introduces adaptive graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for 3D human pose estimation, overcoming GCN limitations by using learnable activation functions and multi-hop feature aggregation to capture long-range dependencies and high-frequency details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GCN-based methods for 3D pose estimation have limited receptive fields that struggle with long-range dependencies needed for handling occlusions and depth ambiguities, and exhibit spectral bias that prioritizes low-frequency components over high-frequency details.

Method: PoseKAN extends KANs to graph-based learning with learnable functions on graph edges, multi-hop feature aggregation for local and distant neighbor information, residual PoseKAN blocks for deep feature refinement, and global response normalization for feature selectivity.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods in 3D human pose estimation from single images.

Conclusion: The proposed PoseKAN framework effectively addresses GCN limitations through adaptive graph learning, achieving improved spatial awareness and expressiveness for complex pose variations in 3D pose estimation.

Abstract: Graph convolutional network (GCN)-based methods have shown strong performance in 3D human pose estimation by leveraging the natural graph structure of the human skeleton. However, their local receptive field limits their ability to capture long-range dependencies essential for handling occlusions and depth ambiguities. They also exhibit spectral bias, which prioritizes low-frequency components while struggling to model high-frequency details. In this paper, we introduce PoseKAN, an adaptive graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), framework that extends KANs to graph-based learning for 2D-to-3D pose lifting from a single image. Unlike GCNs that use fixed activation functions, KANs employ learnable functions on graph edges, allowing data-driven, adaptive feature transformations. This enhances the model's adaptability and expressiveness, making it more expressive in learning complex pose variations. Our model employs multi-hop feature aggregation, ensuring the body joints can leverage information from both local and distant neighbors, leading to improved spatial awareness. It also incorporates residual PoseKAN blocks for deeper feature refinement, and a global response normalization for improved feature selectivity and contrast. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our model against state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SIFT-Graph is a multimodal defense framework that enhances vision model robustness by combining SIFT keypoints with Graph Attention Networks to create perturbation-resistant features, then fusing them with traditional vision models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional vision models rely on fragile pixel-level representations vulnerable to adversarial attacks, lacking mechanisms to incorporate inherently robust visual features.

Method: Integrates Scale-Invariant Feature Transform keypoints with Graph Attention Network to capture scale/rotation invariant local structures, then fuses these robust embeddings with traditional vision models like Vision Transformers and CNNs.

Result: Effectively improves model robustness against gradient-based white box adversarial attacks with only marginal drop in clean accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal framework successfully enhances vision model robustness by leveraging structurally meaningful features that are inherently resilient to perturbations.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks expose a fundamental vulnerability in modern deep vision models by exploiting their dependence on dense, pixel-level representations that are highly sensitive to imperceptible perturbations. Traditional defense strategies typically operate within this fragile pixel domain, lacking mechanisms to incorporate inherently robust visual features. In this work, we introduce SIFT-Graph, a multimodal defense framework that enhances the robustness of traditional vision models by aggregating structurally meaningful features extracted from raw images using both handcrafted and learned modalities. Specifically, we integrate Scale-Invariant Feature Transform keypoints with a Graph Attention Network to capture scale and rotation invariant local structures that are resilient to perturbations. These robust feature embeddings are then fused with traditional vision model, such as Vision Transformer and Convolutional Neural Network, to form a unified, structure-aware and perturbation defensive model. Preliminary results demonstrate that our method effectively improves the visual model robustness against gradient-based white box adversarial attacks, while incurring only a marginal drop in clean accuracy.

*Wonbong Jang,Jonathan Tremblay,Lourdes Agapito*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DT-NVS is a 3D diffusion model for generalized novel view synthesis from single images, trained on real-world videos using transformer architecture and novel camera conditioning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based approaches are limited to small camera movements or unnatural object-centric scenes, restricting real-world applications. The paper aims to enable novel view synthesis for everyday scenes from single views.

Method: Proposes DT-NVS - a 3D-aware diffusion model with transformer backbone, novel camera conditioning for unaligned datasets, and a training paradigm that swaps reference frames between conditioning image and noisy input.

Result: Shows improvements over state-of-the-art 3D diffusion models and deterministic approaches on generalized novel view synthesis from single images, while generating diverse outputs.

Conclusion: The approach successfully enables novel view synthesis for real-world scenes from single views, overcoming limitations of previous constrained regimes through innovative transformer architecture and training strategies.

Abstract: Generating novel views of a natural scene, e.g., every-day scenes both indoors and outdoors, from a single view is an under-explored problem, even though it is an organic extension to the object-centric novel view synthesis. Existing diffusion-based approaches focus rather on small camera movements in real scenes or only consider unnatural object-centric scenes, limiting their potential applications in real-world settings. In this paper we move away from these constrained regimes and propose a 3D diffusion model trained with image-only losses on a large-scale dataset of real-world, multi-category, unaligned, and casually acquired videos of everyday scenes. We propose DT-NVS, a 3D-aware diffusion model for generalized novel view synthesis that exploits a transformer-based architecture backbone. We make significant contributions to transformer and self-attention architectures to translate images to 3d representations, and novel camera conditioning strategies to allow training on real-world unaligned datasets. In addition, we introduce a novel training paradigm swapping the role of reference frame between the conditioning image and the sampled noisy input. We evaluate our approach on the 3D task of generalized novel view synthesis from a single input image and show improvements over state-of-the-art 3D aware diffusion models and deterministic approaches, while generating diverse outputs.

### [16] [Enhancing Rotation-Invariant 3D Learning with Global Pose Awareness and Attention Mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08833)
*Jiaxun Guo,Manar Amayri,Nizar Bouguila,Xin Liu,Wentao Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Shadow-informed Pose Feature (SiPF) and Rotation-invariant Attention Convolution (RIAttnConv) to address wing-tip feature collapse in 3D point cloud analysis by preserving global pose information while maintaining rotation invariance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing rotation-invariant methods lose global pose information, making them unable to distinguish geometrically similar but spatially distinct structures (e.g., left vs right airplane wings) due to limited receptive fields.

Method: Introduces SiPF that augments local RI descriptors with globally consistent reference points ('shadows') from learned shared rotations, and RIAttnConv that integrates SiPFs into feature aggregation. Uses Bingham distribution-based shadow locating module for optimal global rotation learning.

Result: Substantially outperforms existing rotation-invariant methods on 3D classification and part segmentation benchmarks, especially in tasks requiring fine-grained spatial discrimination under arbitrary rotations.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully overcomes wing-tip feature collapse by preserving global pose awareness while maintaining rotation invariance, enabling better discrimination of structurally similar components in 3D point clouds.

Abstract: Recent advances in rotation-invariant (RI) learning for 3D point clouds typically replace raw coordinates with handcrafted RI features to ensure robustness under arbitrary rotations. However, these approaches often suffer from the loss of global pose information, making them incapable of distinguishing geometrically similar but spatially distinct structures. We identify that this limitation stems from the restricted receptive field in existing RI methods, leading to Wing-tip feature collapse, a failure to differentiate symmetric components (e.g., left and right airplane wings) due to indistinguishable local geometries. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the Shadow-informed Pose Feature (SiPF), which augments local RI descriptors with a globally consistent reference point (referred to as the 'shadow') derived from a learned shared rotation. This mechanism enables the model to preserve global pose awareness while maintaining rotation invariance. We further propose Rotation-invariant Attention Convolution (RIAttnConv), an attention-based operator that integrates SiPFs into the feature aggregation process, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to distinguish structurally similar components. Additionally, we design a task-adaptive shadow locating module based on the Bingham distribution over unit quaternions, which dynamically learns the optimal global rotation for constructing consistent shadows. Extensive experiments on 3D classification and part segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms existing RI methods, particularly in tasks requiring fine-grained spatial discrimination under arbitrary rotations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAS-SSM is a novel Mamba-based architecture for 3D human pose estimation that preserves spatial structure while maintaining linear complexity, achieving competitive performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSM-based methods flatten pose sequences using manual scan operations, disrupting spatial structure and entangling spatial-temporal features, making it hard to capture complex pose dependencies.

Method: Proposes SAS-SSM with structure-aware spatiotemporal convolution for local joint interactions and stride-based scan strategy for multi-scale global structural representations.

Result: SasMamba achieves competitive 3D pose estimation performance with significantly fewer parameters compared to existing hybrid models.

Conclusion: The proposed SAS-SSM effectively models both local and global pose information while maintaining linear computational complexity, offering an efficient alternative to existing methods.

Abstract: Recently, the Mamba architecture based on State Space Models (SSMs) has gained attention in 3D human pose estimation due to its linear complexity and strong global modeling capability. However, existing SSM-based methods typically apply manually designed scan operations to flatten detected 2D pose sequences into purely temporal sequences, either locally or globally. This approach disrupts the inherent spatial structure of human poses and entangles spatial and temporal features, making it difficult to capture complex pose dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose the Skeleton Structure-Aware Stride SSM (SAS-SSM), which first employs a structure-aware spatiotemporal convolution to dynamically capture essential local interactions between joints, and then applies a stride-based scan strategy to construct multi-scale global structural representations. This enables flexible modeling of both local and global pose information while maintaining linear computational complexity. Built upon SAS-SSM, our model SasMamba achieves competitive 3D pose estimation performance with significantly fewer parameters compared to existing hybrid models.

### [18] [Improve Contrastive Clustering Performance by Multiple Fusing-Augmenting ViT Blocks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08883)
*Cheng Wang,Shuisheng Zhou,Fengjiao Peng,Jin Sheng,Feng Ye,Yinli Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel contrastive learning framework called MFAVBs that uses Vision Transformers with multiple fusion-augmentation blocks to improve image clustering performance by explicitly fusing features from positive pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing contrastive learning networks with parameter sharing or momentum updating don't fully exploit complementarity and similarity of positive pairs for clustering feature extraction.

Method: Uses shared-weight ViTs for positive pairs, fuses their features into a larger ViT, splits features into new augmented pairs for multiple fusion through MFAVBs, and projects features into instance-level and clustering-level spaces with CLIP preprocessing.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on seven public datasets in terms of clustering performance.

Conclusion: MFAVBs as backbone for contrastive clustering effectively improves clustering performance through explicit feature fusion and multiple augmentation operations.

Abstract: In the field of image clustering, the widely used contrastive learning networks improve clustering performance by maximizing the similarity between positive pairs and the dissimilarity of negative pairs of the inputs. Extant contrastive learning networks, whose two encoders often implicitly interact with each other by parameter sharing or momentum updating, may not fully exploit the complementarity and similarity of the positive pairs to extract clustering features from input data. To explicitly fuse the learned features of positive pairs, we design a novel multiple fusing-augmenting ViT blocks (MFAVBs) based on the excellent feature learning ability of Vision Transformers (ViT). Firstly, two preprocessed augmentions as positive pairs are separately fed into two shared-weight ViTs, then their output features are fused to input into a larger ViT. Secondly, the learned features are split into a pair of new augmented positive samples and passed to the next FAVBs, enabling multiple fusion and augmention through MFAVBs operations. Finally, the learned features are projected into both instance-level and clustering-level spaces to calculate the cross-entropy loss, followed by parameter updates by backpropagation to finalize the training process. To further enhance ability of the model to distinguish between similar images, our input data for the network we propose is preprocessed augmentions with features extracted from the CLIP pretrained model. Our experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate that MFAVBs serving as the backbone for contrastive clustering outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in terms of clustering performance.

*Sanyukta Adap,Ujjwal Baid,Spyridon Bakas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning approach using EfficientNet architectures achieved high F1 scores (0.98) on training data but lower scores (0.546-0.517) on validation/testing data for classifying 6 histopathological regions in glioblastoma tissue sections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated identification of histological sub-regions in glioblastoma could improve understanding of the disease at scale, as current histopathological assessment hasn't substantially improved patient prognosis.

Method: Four-step deep learning approach using EfficientNet architectures (B0-B4) to classify 6 histopathological regions on H&E stained GBM tissue sections from BraTS-Path 2024 dataset.

Result: EfficientNet-B1 and B4 achieved F1 score of 0.98 in 5-fold cross-validation on training data, but performance dropped to 0.546 on validation and 0.517 on testing data.

Conclusion: The performance gap between training and testing data highlights the challenge of developing generalizable models for clinical applications in glioblastoma histopathology.

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common aggressive, fast-growing brain tumor, with a grim prognosis. Despite clinical diagnostic advancements, there have not been any substantial improvements to patient prognosis. Histopathological assessment of excised tumors is the first line of clinical diagnostic routine. We hypothesize that automated, robust, and accurate identification of distinct histological sub-regions within GBM could contribute to morphologically understanding this disease at scale. In this study, we designed a four-step deep learning approach to classify six (6) histopathological regions and quantitatively evaluated it on the BraTS-Path 2024 challenge dataset, which includes digitized Hematoxylin \& Eosin (H\&E) stained GBM tissue sections annotated for six distinct regions. We used the challenge's publicly available training dataset to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of several variants of EfficientNet architectures (i.e., B0, B1, B2, B3, B4). EfficientNet-B1 and EfficientNet-B4 achieved the best performance, achieving an F1 score of 0.98 in a 5-fold cross-validation configuration using the BraTS-Path training set. The quantitative performance evaluation of our proposed approach with EfficientNet-B1 on the BraTS-Path hold-out validation data and the final hidden testing data yielded F1 scores of 0.546 and 0.517, respectively, for the associated 6-class classification task. The difference in the performance on training, validation, and testing data highlights the challenge of developing models that generalize well to new data, which is crucial for clinical applications.

By leveraging principles of Hebbian learning and temporal continuity associating temporally adjacent views to build invariant representations. VisNet and its extensions capture robust and transformation invariant features. Experimental results across multiple datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR10, and custom symmetric object sets, show that these enhanced VisNet variants substantially improve recognition accuracy compared with the baseline model.

*Riling Wei,Kelu Yao,Chuanguang Yang,Jin Wang,Zhuoyan Gao,Chao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SemBridge, a framework for Asymmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (ACKD) that enables knowledge transfer between modalities with limited semantic overlap, addressing the limitations of traditional symmetric approaches that require strongly paired data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (SCKD) requires strongly paired modalities with strong semantic connections, which is often unavailable in real-world scenarios. The authors aim to address this limitation by exploring knowledge distillation under weak semantic consistency between modalities.

Method: The proposed SemBridge framework includes two key modules: 1) Student-Friendly Matching module that uses self-supervised learning to acquire semantic-based knowledge and provides personalized instruction by dynamically selecting relevant teacher samples, and 2) Semantic-aware Knowledge Alignment module that employs Lagrangian optimization to find optimal transport paths for knowledge transfer.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with 7 existing approaches on 6 different model architectures across various datasets, including a benchmark dataset created from Multi-Spectral and asymmetric RGB images for remote sensing scene classification.

Conclusion: The proposed ACKD approach and SemBridge framework effectively address the challenges of knowledge distillation between weakly aligned modalities, demonstrating superior performance and flexibility in real-world scenarios where strongly paired data is limited.

Abstract: Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation has demonstrated promising performance on paired modalities with strong semantic connections, referred to as Symmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (SCKD). However, implementing SCKD becomes exceedingly constrained in real-world scenarios due to the limited availability of paired modalities. To this end, we investigate a general and effective knowledge learning concept under weak semantic consistency, dubbed Asymmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (ACKD), aiming to bridge modalities with limited semantic overlap. Nevertheless, the shift from strong to weak semantic consistency improves flexibility but exacerbates challenges in knowledge transmission costs, which we rigorously verified based on optimal transport theory. To mitigate the issue, we further propose a framework, namely SemBridge, integrating a Student-Friendly Matching module and a Semantic-aware Knowledge Alignment module. The former leverages self-supervised learning to acquire semantic-based knowledge and provide personalized instruction for each student sample by dynamically selecting the relevant teacher samples. The latter seeks the optimal transport path by employing Lagrangian optimization. To facilitate the research, we curate a benchmark dataset derived from two modalities, namely Multi-Spectral (MS) and asymmetric RGB images, tailored for remote sensing scene classification. Comprehensive experiments exhibit that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with 7 existing approaches on 6 different model architectures across various datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework that enhances semi-supervised document layout detection by fusing visual predictions with structural priors from LLMs via probabilistic weighting, achieving state-of-the-art results with minimal labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Document layout understanding remains data-intensive despite advances in semi-supervised learning, requiring a more efficient approach that leverages both visual and structural information.

Method: Uses OCR-LLM pipeline to infer hierarchical regions from unlabeled documents, then combines with teacher detector outputs through inverse-variance fusion to generate refined pseudo-labels with instance-adaptive gating.

Result: Achieved 88.2±0.3 AP with lightweight SwiftFormer using only 5% labels, and 89.7±0.4 AP with LayoutLMv3, surpassing standard semi-supervised learning and matching UDOP which requires extensive pretraining.

Conclusion: LLM structural priors are complementary to both lightweight and pretrained architectures, enabling privacy-preserving deployment with minimal performance loss and providing targeted semantic disambiguation beyond simple text heuristics.

Abstract: Document layout understanding remains data-intensive despite advances in semi-supervised learning. We present a framework that enhances semi-supervised detection by fusing visual predictions with structural priors from text-pretrained LLMs via principled probabilistic weighting. Given unlabeled documents, an OCR-LLM pipeline infers hierarchical regions which are combined with teacher detector outputs through inverse-variance fusion to generate refined pseudo-labels.Our method demonstrates consistent gains across model scales. With a lightweight SwiftFormer backbone (26M params), we achieve 88.2$\pm$0.3 AP using only 5\% labels on PubLayNet. When applied to document-pretrained LayoutLMv3 (133M params), our fusion framework reaches 89.7$\pm$0.4 AP, surpassing both LayoutLMv3 with standard semi-supervised learning (89.1$\pm$0.4 AP, p=0.02) and matching UDOP~\cite{udop} (89.8 AP) which requires 100M+ pages of multimodal pretraining. This demonstrates that LLM structural priors are complementary to both lightweight and pretrained architectures. Key findings include: (1) learned instance-adaptive gating improves over fixed weights by +0.9 AP with data-dependent PAC bounds correctly predicting convergence; (2) open-source LLMs enable privacy-preserving deployment with minimal loss (Llama-3-70B: 87.1 AP lightweight, 89.4 AP with LayoutLMv3); (3) LLMs provide targeted semantic disambiguation (18.7\% of cases, +3.8 AP gain) beyond simple text heuristics.Total system cost includes \$12 for GPT-4o-mini API or 17 GPU-hours for local Llama-3-70B per 50K pages, amortized across training runs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous unsupervised methods suffer from poor performance due to generator overfitting when attempting style transfer and reconstruction across multi-temporal images.

Method: Introduces Consistency Change Detection Framework (CCDF) with two modules: Cycle Consistency to reduce generator overfitting, and Semantic Consistency for detail reconstruction.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed CCDF framework effectively addresses generator overfitting and improves unsupervised change detection performance through consistency modules.

Abstract: Unsupervised remote sensing change detection aims to monitor and analyze changes from multi-temporal remote sensing images in the same geometric region at different times, without the need for labeled training data. Previous unsupervised methods attempt to achieve style transfer across multi-temporal remote sensing images through reconstruction by a generator network, and then capture the unreconstructable areas as the changed regions. However, it often leads to poor performance due to generator overfitting. In this paper, we propose a novel Consistency Change Detection Framework (CCDF) to address this challenge. Specifically, we introduce a Cycle Consistency (CC) module to reduce the overfitting issues in the generator-based reconstruction. Additionally, we propose a Semantic Consistency (SC) module to enable detail reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HitoMi-Cam is a lightweight, shape-agnostic person detection method using spectral reflectance properties of clothing, achieving 23.2 fps on edge devices and outperforming CNNs in scenarios with unpredictable postures like search and rescue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN-based object detection suffers from shape dependency that degrades performance for postures not included in training data, limiting effectiveness in real-world scenarios like disaster rescue where human postures are unpredictable.

Method: Implemented spectral-based person detection using clothing reflectance properties on resource-constrained edge devices without GPU, building on previous simulation studies.

Result: Achieved 23.2 fps processing speed (253x190 pixels) and 93.5% average precision in search and rescue scenarios, significantly outperforming CNN models (best AP 53.8%) with minimal false positives.

Conclusion: HitoMi-Cam serves as a complementary tool to CNN-based detectors, proving spectral-based detection is viable for real-time edge device operation in environments with unpredictable shapes like disaster scenarios.

Abstract: While convolutional neural network (CNN)-based object detection is widely used, it exhibits a shape dependency that degrades performance for postures not included in the training data. Building upon our previous simulation study published in this journal, this study implements and evaluates the spectral-based approach on physical hardware to address this limitation. Specifically, this paper introduces HitoMi-Cam, a lightweight and shape-agnostic person detection method that uses the spectral reflectance properties of clothing. The author implemented the system on a resource-constrained edge device without a GPU to assess its practical viability. The results indicate that a processing speed of 23.2 frames per second (fps) (253x190 pixels) is achievable, suggesting that the method can be used for real-time applications. In a simulated search and rescue scenario where the performance of CNNs declines, HitoMi-Cam achieved an average precision (AP) of 93.5%, surpassing that of the compared CNN models (best AP of 53.8%). Throughout all evaluation scenarios, the occurrence of false positives remained minimal. This study positions the HitoMi-Cam method not as a replacement for CNN-based detectors but as a complementary tool under specific conditions. The results indicate that spectral-based person detection can be a viable option for real-time operation on edge devices in real-world environments where shapes are unpredictable, such as disaster rescue.

*Zimao Lu,Hui Xu,Bing Liu,Ke Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Negative Entity Suppression (NES) method improves zero-shot image captioning by reducing hallucinations through synthetic images, filtering negative entities, and attention-level suppression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-only training for zero-shot image captioning suffers from poor cross-domain generalization and hallucination, while retrieval-based methods can exacerbate these issues by introducing irrelevant entities.

Method: NES integrates three stages: (1) uses synthetic images for consistent image-to-text retrieval, (2) filters negative entities from retrieved content, and (3) applies attention-level suppression using identified negative entities.

Result: NES maintains competitive in-domain performance while improving cross-domain transfer and reducing hallucination rates, achieving state-of-the-art results in zero-shot image captioning.

Conclusion: The proposed NES method effectively addresses hallucination in zero-shot image captioning through negative entity suppression, demonstrating superior cross-domain generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Text-only training provides an attractive approach to address data scarcity challenges in zero-shot image captioning (ZIC), avoiding the expense of collecting paired image-text annotations. However, although these approaches perform well within training domains, they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization, often producing hallucinated content when encountering novel visual environments. Retrieval-based methods attempt to mitigate this limitation by leveraging external knowledge, but they can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination when retrieved captions contain entities irrelevant to the inputs. We introduce the concept of negative entities--objects that appear in generated caption but are absent from the input--and propose Negative Entity Suppression (NES) to tackle this challenge. NES seamlessly integrates three stages: (1) it employs synthetic images to ensure consistent image-to-text retrieval across both training and inference; (2) it filters negative entities from retrieved content to enhance accuracy; and (3) it applies attention-level suppression using identified negative entities to further minimize the impact of hallucination-prone features. Evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates that NES maintains competitive in-domain performance while improving cross-domain transfer and reducing hallucination rates, achieving new state-of-the-art results in ZIC.

TL;DR: SPEED-Q is a novel framework for low-bit weight-only quantization of Vision-Language Models (1B-2B parameters) that addresses modality sensitivity discrepancies and training instability through staged processing and enhanced distillation, achieving up to 6x higher accuracy than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying VLMs on resource-constrained edge devices requires efficient quantization methods, but existing research rarely explores aggressive quantization for small-scale VLMs suitable for edge deployment.

Method: Proposes SPEED-Q with staged sensitivity adaptive mechanism to harmonize performance across vision and language components, and distillation-enhanced quantization strategy to stabilize training and reduce data dependence.

Result: Achieves up to 6x higher accuracy than existing quantization methods under 2-bit settings and consistently outperforms prior on-device VLMs under both 2-bit and 4-bit settings across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: SPEED-Q enables accurate, stable, and data-efficient quantization of complex VLMs, making it the first framework tailored for quantizing entire small-scale billion-parameter VLMs to low bits for edge deployment.

Abstract: Deploying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on edge devices (e.g., smartphones and robots) is crucial for enabling low-latency and privacy-preserving intelligent applications. Given the resource constraints of these devices, quantization offers a promising solution by improving memory efficiency and reducing bandwidth requirements, thereby facilitating the deployment of VLMs. However, existing research has rarely explored aggressive quantization on VLMs, particularly for the models ranging from 1B to 2B parameters, which are more suitable for resource-constrained edge devices. In this paper, we propose SPEED-Q, a novel Staged Processing with Enhanced Distillation framework for VLM low-bit weight-only quantization that systematically addresses the following two critical obstacles: (1) significant discrepancies in quantization sensitivity between vision (ViT) and language (LLM) components in VLMs; (2) training instability arising from the reduced numerical precision inherent in low-bit quantization. In SPEED-Q, a staged sensitivity adaptive mechanism is introduced to effectively harmonize performance across different modalities. We further propose a distillation-enhanced quantization strategy to stabilize the training process and reduce data dependence. Together, SPEED-Q enables accurate, stable, and data-efficient quantization of complex VLMs. SPEED-Q is the first framework tailored for quantizing entire small-scale billion-parameter VLMs to low bits. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SPEED-Q achieves up to 6x higher accuracy than existing quantization methods under 2-bit settings and consistently outperforms prior on-device VLMs under both 2-bit and 4-bit settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diff-FCHM is a novel human-machine collaborative compression method that uses machine-vision-oriented compression as the basis, progressively aggregating semantics for machine tasks and using diffusion prior to restore high-fidelity details for human vision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing collaborative compression methods are built on human-vision pipelines, which are inefficient for machine vision tasks that only focus on core regions and require less information. This leads to complexity and bit-rate issues when aggregating machine-vision compression.

Method: Proposes a machine-vision-oriented compression pipeline where machine vision serves as the basis. Uses a plug-and-play variable bit-rate strategy for machine tasks, progressively aggregates semantics from machine-vision compression, and employs diffusion prior to restore high-fidelity details for human vision.

Result: Experimental results show consistently superior performance on both machine-vision and human-vision compression with remarkable margins compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Diff-FCHM successfully establishes machine-vision-oriented compression as the foundation for collaborative compression, achieving better efficiency and performance for both human and machine vision tasks.

Abstract: Human-machine collaborative compression has been receiving increasing research efforts for reducing image/video data, serving as the basis for both human perception and machine intelligence. Existing collaborative methods are dominantly built upon the de facto human-vision compression pipeline, witnessing deficiency on complexity and bit-rates when aggregating the machine-vision compression. Indeed, machine vision solely focuses on the core regions within the image/video, requiring much less information compared with the compressed information for human vision. In this paper, we thus set out the first successful attempt by a novel collaborative compression method based on the machine-vision-oriented compression, instead of human-vision pipeline. In other words, machine vision serves as the basis for human vision within collaborative compression. A plug-and-play variable bit-rate strategy is also developed for machine vision tasks. Then, we propose to progressively aggregate the semantics from the machine-vision compression, whilst seamlessly tailing the diffusion prior to restore high-fidelity details for human vision, thus named as diffusion-prior based feature compression for human and machine visions (Diff-FCHM). Experimental results verify the consistently superior performances of our Diff-FCHM, on both machine-vision and human-vision compression with remarkable margins. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance: FID of 2.26 on ImageNet 256×256 (rivaling 250-step teacher) and promising results on high-resolution MJHQ text-to-image benchmark.

Conclusion: Establishes a robust new paradigm for high-fidelity single-step diffusion models by synergistically combining trajectory and distribution distillation approaches.

Abstract: The inference latency of diffusion models remains a critical barrier to their real-time application. While trajectory-based and distribution-based step distillation methods offer solutions, they present a fundamental trade-off. Trajectory-based methods preserve global structure but act as a "lossy compressor", sacrificing high-frequency details. Conversely, distribution-based methods can achieve higher fidelity but often suffer from mode collapse and unstable training. This paper recasts them from independent paradigms into synergistic components within our novel Hierarchical Distillation (HD) framework. We leverage trajectory distillation not as a final generator, but to establish a structural ``sketch", providing a near-optimal initialization for the subsequent distribution-based refinement stage. This strategy yields an ideal initial distribution that enhances the ceiling of overall performance. To further improve quality, we introduce and refine the adversarial training process. We find standard discriminator structures are ineffective at refining an already high-quality generator. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Weighted Discriminator (AWD), tailored for the HD pipeline. By dynamically allocating token weights, AWD focuses on local imperfections, enabling efficient detail refinement. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks. On ImageNet $256\times256$, our single-step model achieves an FID of 2.26, rivaling its 250-step teacher. It also achieves promising results on the high-resolution text-to-image MJHQ benchmark, proving its generalizability. Our method establishes a robust new paradigm for high-fidelity, single-step diffusion models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NAMEA is a novel ensemble attack that integrates gradients from non-attention areas of heterogeneous models to improve adversarial transferability across different architectures like CNNs and ViTs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous ensemble attacks show unsatisfactory performance when transferring across heterogeneous model architectures due to widely differing gradient update directions, making it hard to reduce gradient variance while utilizing individual models effectively.

Method: Decouples gradients from attention and non-attention areas of ensemble models, then merges them using meta-learning. Specifically focuses on integrating gradients from non-attention areas since attention areas vary sharply across heterogeneous models.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art ensemble attacks AdaEA and SMER by an average of 15.0% and 9.6% respectively on ImageNet dataset.

Conclusion: First work to explore ensemble non-attention for boosting cross-architecture transferability, providing new insights into launching effective ensemble attacks across heterogeneous models.

Abstract: Ensemble attacks integrate the outputs of surrogate models with diverse architectures, which can be combined with various gradient-based attacks to improve adversarial transferability. However, previous work shows unsatisfactory attack performance when transferring across heterogeneous model architectures. The main reason is that the gradient update directions of heterogeneous surrogate models differ widely, making it hard to reduce the gradient variance of ensemble models while making the best of individual model. To tackle this challenge, we design a novel ensemble attack, NAMEA, which for the first time integrates the gradients from the non-attention areas of ensemble models into the iterative gradient optimization process. Our design is inspired by the observation that the attention areas of heterogeneous models vary sharply, thus the non-attention areas of ViTs are likely to be the focus of CNNs and vice versa. Therefore, we merge the gradients respectively from the attention and non-attention areas of ensemble models so as to fuse the transfer information of CNNs and ViTs. Specifically, we pioneer a new way of decoupling the gradients of non-attention areas from those of attention areas, while merging gradients by meta-learning. Empirical evaluations on ImageNet dataset indicate that NAMEA outperforms AdaEA and SMER, the state-of-the-art ensemble attacks by an average of 15.0% and 9.6%, respectively. This work is the first attempt to explore the power of ensemble non-attention in boosting cross-architecture transferability, providing new insights into launching ensemble attacks.

TL;DR: BRHVC is a novel neural B-frame video compression method that harmonizes bi-directional references using Bi-directional Motion Converge and Bi-directional Contextual Fusion to improve compression performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural B-frame video compression is underexplored compared to P-frame compression, and existing hierarchical coding in NBVC can cause unbalanced contribution from reference frames due to large frame spans.

Method: Proposes Bi-directional Motion Converge (BMC) to converge multiple optical flows for better motion compensation, and Bi-directional Contextual Fusion (BCF) to model reference context weights based on motion compensation accuracy.

Result: BRHVC outperforms previous state-of-the-art neural video compression methods and even surpasses traditional coding VTM-RA on HEVC datasets under random access configuration.

Conclusion: The proposed BRHVC method effectively harmonizes bi-directional references through more efficient motion and context utilization, achieving superior compression performance.

Abstract: Neural video compression (NVC) has made significant progress in recent years, while neural B-frame video compression (NBVC) remains underexplored compared to P-frame compression. NBVC can adopt bi-directional reference frames for better compression performance. However, NBVC's hierarchical coding may complicate continuous temporal prediction, especially at some hierarchical levels with a large frame span, which could cause the contribution of the two reference frames to be unbalanced. To optimize reference information utilization, we propose a novel NBVC method, termed Bi-directional Reference Harmonization Video Compression (BRHVC), with the proposed Bi-directional Motion Converge (BMC) and Bi-directional Contextual Fusion (BCF). BMC converges multiple optical flows in motion compression, leading to more accurate motion compensation on a larger scale. Then BCF explicitly models the weights of reference contexts under the guidance of motion compensation accuracy. With more efficient motions and contexts, BRHVC can effectively harmonize bi-directional references. Experimental results indicate that our BRHVC outperforms previous state-of-the-art NVC methods, even surpassing the traditional coding, VTM-RA (under random access configuration), on the HEVC datasets.

TL;DR: Proposes FGM-HD framework that uses Hausdorff Dimension to enhance diversity in Fractal Generative Models while maintaining image quality, achieving 39% diversity improvement on ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fractal Generative Models generate high-quality images but suffer from limited diversity due to inherent self-similarity, creating a need to improve output variety without compromising visual quality.

Method: Uses learnable HD estimation from image embeddings, HD-based loss with momentum-driven scheduling during training, and HD-guided rejection sampling during inference to select geometrically richer outputs.

Result: Achieves 39% improvement in output diversity compared to vanilla FGMs on ImageNet dataset while preserving comparable image quality.

Conclusion: First work to introduce Hausdorff Dimension into FGM, effectively enhancing diversity while providing theoretical contribution to FGM development.

Abstract: Improving the diversity of generated results while maintaining high visual quality remains a significant challenge in image generation tasks. Fractal Generative Models (FGMs) are efficient in generating high-quality images, but their inherent self-similarity limits the diversity of output images. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach based on the Hausdorff Dimension (HD), a widely recognized concept in fractal geometry used to quantify structural complexity, which aids in enhancing the diversity of generated outputs. To incorporate HD into FGM, we propose a learnable HD estimation method that predicts HD directly from image embeddings, addressing computational cost concerns. However, simply introducing HD into a hybrid loss is insufficient to enhance diversity in FGMs due to: 1) degradation of image quality, and 2) limited improvement in generation diversity. To this end, during training, we adopt an HD-based loss with a monotonic momentum-driven scheduling strategy to progressively optimize the hyperparameters, obtaining optimal diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Moreover, during inference, we employ HD-guided rejection sampling to select geometrically richer outputs. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our FGM-HD framework yields a 39\% improvement in output diversity compared to vanilla FGMs, while preserving comparable image quality. To our knowledge, this is the very first work introducing HD into FGM. Our method effectively enhances the diversity of generated outputs while offering a principled theoretical contribution to FGM development.

TL;DR: AuthSig is a static electronic signature framework that embeds authentication watermarks using generative models to prevent signature copying and reuse, achieving over 98% extraction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static scanned signatures are widely used but lack authentication attributes, making them vulnerable to malicious copying and reuse despite the availability of more secure alternatives.

Method: Uses generative models to modulate style embeddings and implicitly encode watermark bits, with a keypoint-driven data augmentation strategy to enhance style diversity for robust watermark embedding.

Result: Achieves over 98% watermark extraction accuracy under digital-domain distortions, signature-specific degradations, and remains effective in print-scan scenarios.

Conclusion: AuthSig successfully addresses the security vulnerabilities of static electronic signatures by embedding imperceptible authentication watermarks, enforcing a One Signature, One Use policy.

Abstract: With the deepening trend of paperless workflows, signatures as a means of identity authentication are gradually shifting from traditional ink-on-paper to electronic formats.Despite the availability of dynamic pressure-sensitive and PKI-based digital signatures, static scanned signatures remain prevalent in practice due to their convenience. However, these static images, having almost lost their authentication attributes, cannot be reliably verified and are vulnerable to malicious copying and reuse. To address these issues, we propose AuthSig, a novel static electronic signature framework based on generative models and watermark, which binds authentication information to the signature image. Leveraging the human visual system's insensitivity to subtle style variations, AuthSig finely modulates style embeddings during generation to implicitly encode watermark bits-enforcing a One Signature, One Use policy.To overcome the scarcity of handwritten signature data and the limitations of traditional augmentation methods, we introduce a keypoint-driven data augmentation strategy that effectively enhances style diversity to support robust watermark embedding. Experimental results show that AuthSig achieves over 98% extraction accuracy under both digital-domain distortions and signature-specific degradations, and remains effective even in print-scan scenarios.

TL;DR: CoDR framework improves ICL performance through diverse coreset construction and dual retrieval mechanism for efficient demonstration selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional demonstration selection methods for in-context learning are inefficient or suboptimal, struggling to balance efficiency and effectiveness.

Method: Proposed Coreset-based Dual Retrieval (CoDR) with cluster-pruning for diverse coreset construction and dual retrieval mechanism for global selection.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvement in ICL performance compared to existing strategies.

Conclusion: CoDR provides a robust solution for effective and efficient demonstration selection in in-context learning.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs), enabling them to leverage a few examples directly from input contexts. However, the effectiveness of this approach is heavily reliant on the selection of demonstrations, a process that is NP-hard. Traditional strategies, including random, similarity-based sampling and infoscore-based sampling, often lead to inefficiencies or suboptimal performance, struggling to balance both efficiency and effectiveness in demonstration selection. In this paper, we propose a novel demonstration selection framework named Coreset-based Dual Retrieval (CoDR). We show that samples within a diverse subset achieve a higher expected mutual information. To implement this, we introduce a cluster-pruning method to construct a diverse coreset that aligns more effectively with the query while maintaining diversity. Additionally, we develop a dual retrieval mechanism that enhances the selection process by achieving global demonstration selection while preserving efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the ICL performance compared to the existing strategies, providing a robust solution for effective and efficient demonstration selection.

TL;DR: WDT-MD is a Wavelet Diffusion Transformer framework that addresses limitations in diffusion-based microaneurysm detection by preventing identity mapping, improving anomaly discrimination, and enhancing normal feature reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based methods for microaneurysm detection suffer from identity mapping issues, poor discrimination between MAs and other anomalies, and suboptimal reconstruction of normal retinal features, limiting their clinical application.

Method: Proposes WDT-MD with three innovations: noise-encoded image conditioning to avoid identity mapping, pseudo-normal pattern synthesis via inpainting for pixel-level supervision, and wavelet diffusion Transformer combining global modeling with multi-scale analysis.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on IDRiD and e-ophtha MA datasets in both pixel-level and image-level microaneurysm detection.

Conclusion: WDT-MD shows significant promise for improving early diabetic retinopathy screening by addressing fundamental limitations of existing diffusion-based approaches.

Abstract: Microaneurysms (MAs), the earliest pathognomonic signs of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), present as sub-60 $μm$ lesions in fundus images with highly variable photometric and morphological characteristics, rendering manual screening not only labor-intensive but inherently error-prone. While diffusion-based anomaly detection has emerged as a promising approach for automated MA screening, its clinical application is hindered by three fundamental limitations. First, these models often fall prey to "identity mapping", where they inadvertently replicate the input image. Second, they struggle to distinguish MAs from other anomalies, leading to high false positives. Third, their suboptimal reconstruction of normal features hampers overall performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Wavelet Diffusion Transformer framework for MA Detection (WDT-MD), which features three key innovations: a noise-encoded image conditioning mechanism to avoid "identity mapping" by perturbing image conditions during training; pseudo-normal pattern synthesis via inpainting to introduce pixel-level supervision, enabling discrimination between MAs and other anomalies; and a wavelet diffusion Transformer architecture that combines the global modeling capability of diffusion Transformers with multi-scale wavelet analysis to enhance reconstruction of normal retinal features. Comprehensive experiments on the IDRiD and e-ophtha MA datasets demonstrate that WDT-MD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both pixel-level and image-level MA detection. This advancement holds significant promise for improving early DR screening.

TL;DR: A variational segmentation model combining denoising with adaptive TV regularization and bias field estimation for handling noisy images with intensity inhomogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing segmentation methods perform poorly on images corrupted by noise (Gamma-distributed multiplicative noise, Poisson noise) and intensity inhomogeneity.

Method: Integrates denoising terms (I-divergence + adaptive TV regularizer) with spatially adaptive weights and bias field estimation within ICTM framework, optimized using RMSAV scheme.

Result: Superior accuracy and robustness on synthetic and real-world images with intensity inhomogeneity and diverse noise types compared to competing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively handles challenging segmentation scenarios involving noise and intensity inhomogeneity through integrated denoising and adaptive regularization.

Abstract: Image segmentation is a core task in image processing, yet many methods degrade when images are heavily corrupted by noise and exhibit intensity inhomogeneity. Within the iterative-convolution thresholding method (ICTM) framework, we propose a variational segmentation model that integrates denoising terms. Specifically, the denoising component consists of an I-divergence term and an adaptive total-variation (TV) regularizer, making the model well suited to images contaminated by Gamma--distributed multiplicative noise and Poisson noise. A spatially adaptive weight derived from a gray-level indicator guides diffusion differently across regions of varying intensity. To further address intensity inhomogeneity, we estimate a smoothly varying bias field, which improves segmentation accuracy. Regions are represented by characteristic functions, with contour length encoded accordingly. For efficient optimization, we couple ICTM with a relaxed modified scalar auxiliary variable (RMSAV) scheme. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world images with intensity inhomogeneity and diverse noise types show that the proposed model achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared with competing approaches.

TL;DR: T-Rex-Omni introduces negative visual prompts to improve open-set object detection by addressing vulnerabilities to visually similar distractors, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current open-set object detectors rely only on positive indicators and are vulnerable to visually similar but semantically different distractors, limiting their robustness.

Method: Proposes a unified visual prompt encoder for positive/negative prompts, a training-free Negating Negative Computing module for dynamic suppression, and Negating Negative Hinge loss for discriminative embedding margins.

Result: Achieves remarkable zero-shot detection performance (51.2 AP_r on LVIS-minival), significantly narrowing gap between visual-prompted and text-prompted methods, with particular strength in long-tailed scenarios.

Conclusion: Negative prompts establish a crucial new dimension for advancing open-set visual recognition systems, enabling flexible deployment with both positive-only and joint positive-negative inference modes.

Abstract: Object detection methods have evolved from closed-set to open-set paradigms over the years. Current open-set object detectors, however, remain constrained by their exclusive reliance on positive indicators based on given prompts like text descriptions or visual exemplars. This positive-only paradigm experiences consistent vulnerability to visually similar but semantically different distractors. We propose T-Rex-Omni, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating negative visual prompts to negate hard negative distractors. Specifically, we first introduce a unified visual prompt encoder that jointly processes positive and negative visual prompts. Next, a training-free Negating Negative Computing (NNC) module is proposed to dynamically suppress negative responses during the probability computing stage. To further boost performance through fine-tuning, our Negating Negative Hinge (NNH) loss enforces discriminative margins between positive and negative embeddings. T-Rex-Omni supports flexible deployment in both positive-only and joint positive-negative inference modes, accommodating either user-specified or automatically generated negative examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate remarkable zero-shot detection performance, significantly narrowing the performance gap between visual-prompted and text-prompted methods while showing particular strength in long-tailed scenarios (51.2 AP_r on LVIS-minival). This work establishes negative prompts as a crucial new dimension for advancing open-set visual recognition systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches regulate visual or textual attention independently, overlooking their interaction as key causal factors for object hallucination in LVLMs.

Method: Proposes VTACR metric to quantify modality imbalance, designs fine-grained attention intervention mechanism guided by VTACR, and implements dual-path contrastive decoding with one path emphasizing visual grounding and the other amplifying hallucinations.

Result: Achieves significant hallucination reduction on POPE and CHAIR benchmarks, setting new SOTA in faithfulness while preserving vision-language understanding capability.

Conclusion: Owl effectively addresses object hallucination by modeling attention interactions causally and dynamically adjusting modality contributions during decoding.

Abstract: Object hallucination remains a critical challenge in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), where models generate content inconsistent with visual inputs. Existing language-decoder based mitigation approaches often regulate visual or textual attention independently, overlooking their interaction as two key causal factors. To address this, we propose Owl (Bi-mOdal attention reWeighting for Layer-wise hallucination mitigation), a causally-grounded framework that models hallucination process via a structural causal graph, treating decomposed visual and textual attentions as mediators. We introduce VTACR (Visual-to-Textual Attention Contribution Ratio), a novel metric that quantifies the modality contribution imbalance during decoding. Our analysis reveals that hallucinations frequently occur in low-VTACR scenarios, where textual priors dominate and visual grounding is weakened. To mitigate this, we design a fine-grained attention intervention mechanism that dynamically adjusts token- and layer-wise attention guided by VTACR signals. Finally, we propose a dual-path contrastive decoding strategy: one path emphasizes visually grounded predictions, while the other amplifies hallucinated ones -- letting visual truth shine and hallucination collapse. Experimental results on the POPE and CHAIR benchmarks show that Owl achieves significant hallucination reduction, setting a new SOTA in faithfulness while preserving vision-language understanding capability.

Conclusion: USF-Net effectively addresses key challenges in cloud image sequence extrapolation through its unified spatiotemporal fusion approach, demonstrating both improved performance and computational efficiency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Ground-based remote sensing cloud image sequence extrapolation is a key research area in the development of photovoltaic power systems. However, existing approaches exhibit several limitations:(1)they primarily rely on static kernels to augment feature information, lacking adaptive mechanisms to extract features at varying resolutions dynamically;(2)temporal guidance is insufficient, leading to suboptimal modeling of long-range spatiotemporal dependencies; and(3)the quadratic computational cost of attention mechanisms is often overlooked, limiting efficiency in practical deployment. To address these challenges, we propose USF-Net, a Unified Spatiotemporal Fusion Network that integrates adaptive large-kernel convolutions and a low-complexity attention mechanism, combining temporal flow information within an encoder-decoder framework. Specifically, the encoder employs three basic layers to extract features. Followed by the USTM, which comprises:(1)a SiB equipped with a SSM that dynamically captures multi-scale contextual information, and(2)a TiB featuring a TAM that effectively models long-range temporal dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. In addition, a DSM with a TGM is introduced to enable unified modeling of temporally guided spatiotemporal dependencies. On the decoder side, a DUM is employed to address the common "ghosting effect." It utilizes the initial temporal state as an attention operator to preserve critical motion signatures. As a key contribution, we also introduce and release the ASI-CIS dataset. Extensive experiments on ASI-CIS demonstrate that USF-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing a superior balance between prediction accuracy and computational efficiency for ground-based cloud extrapolation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation models lack causal control and long-horizon consistency, while current world models are restricted to specific domains with limited generalization. There's a need for a general world model that can simulate diverse environments with interactive control.

Method: PAN uses Generative Latent Prediction (GLP) architecture: an autoregressive latent dynamics backbone based on LLM for language-grounded reasoning and action conditioning, combined with a video diffusion decoder for detailed visual reconstruction.

Result: PAN achieves strong performance in action-conditioned world simulation, long-horizon forecasting, and simulative reasoning compared to other models, supporting open-domain simulation with coherent long-term dynamics.

Conclusion: PAN represents progress toward general world models that enable predictive simulation of future states for reasoning and acting, unifying latent space imagination with realizable world dynamics.

Abstract: A world model enables an intelligent agent to imagine, predict, and reason about how the world evolves in response to its actions, and accordingly to plan and strategize. While recent video generation models produce realistic visual sequences, they typically operate in the prompt-to-full-video manner without causal control, interactivity, or long-horizon consistency required for purposeful reasoning. Existing world modeling efforts, on the other hand, often focus on restricted domains (e.g., physical, game, or 3D-scene dynamics) with limited depth and controllability, and struggle to generalize across diverse environments and interaction formats. In this work, we introduce PAN, a general, interactable, and long-horizon world model that predicts future world states through high-quality video simulation conditioned on history and natural language actions. PAN employs the Generative Latent Prediction (GLP) architecture that combines an autoregressive latent dynamics backbone based on a large language model (LLM), which grounds simulation in extensive text-based knowledge and enables conditioning on language-specified actions, with a video diffusion decoder that reconstructs perceptually detailed and temporally coherent visual observations, to achieve a unification between latent space reasoning (imagination) and realizable world dynamics (reality). Trained on large-scale video-action pairs spanning diverse domains, PAN supports open-domain, action-conditioned simulation with coherent, long-term dynamics. Extensive experiments show that PAN achieves strong performance in action-conditioned world simulation, long-horizon forecasting, and simulative reasoning compared to other video generators and world models, taking a step towards general world models that enable predictive simulation of future world states for reasoning and acting.

TL;DR: VietMEAgent is a multimodal explainable framework for Vietnamese cultural VQA that integrates cultural object detection with program generation, providing transparent explanations combining visual evidence and textual rationales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VQA systems struggle with culturally specific content due to under-represented cultural knowledge in training data and lack of interpretable reasoning processes for end users.

Method: Integrates cultural object detection backbone with structured program generation layer, uses curated Vietnamese cultural knowledge base, and combines attention-based visual evidence with human-readable textual rationales.

Result: Developed a practical Vietnamese Cultural VQA dataset and demonstrated programming-based methodologies for cultural AI, providing transparent explanations that reveal computational rationale and cultural context.

Conclusion: The system supports education and cultural preservation with emphasis on interpretability and cultural sensitivity through tightly coupled answer prediction and explanation pipeline.

Abstract: Contemporary Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems remain constrained when confronted with culturally specific content, largely because cultural knowledge is under-represented in training corpora and the reasoning process is not rendered interpretable to end users. This paper introduces VietMEAgent, a multimodal explainable framework engineered for Vietnamese cultural understanding. The method integrates a cultural object detection backbone with a structured program generation layer, yielding a pipeline in which answer prediction and explanation are tightly coupled. A curated knowledge base of Vietnamese cultural entities serves as an explicit source of background information, while a dual-modality explanation module combines attention-based visual evidence with structured, human-readable textual rationales. We further construct a Vietnamese Cultural VQA dataset sourced from public repositories and use it to demonstrate the practicality of programming-based methodologies for cultural AI. The resulting system provides transparent explanations that disclose both the computational rationale and the underlying cultural context, supporting education and cultural preservation with an emphasis on interpretability and cultural sensitivity.

### [43] [Diversifying Counterattacks: Orthogonal Exploration for Robust CLIP Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09064)
*Chengze Jiang,Minjing Dong,Xinli Shi,Jie Gui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DOC improves adversarial robustness in vision-language models by generating diverse counterattacks using orthogonal gradient directions and momentum-based updates, expanding the counterattack space beyond previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing counterattack methods like TTC are limited by narrow search spaces and lack diversity, making them vulnerable to overfitting and unable to fully neutralize broad adversarial perturbations.

Method: Proposes Directional Orthogonal Counterattack (DOC) that incorporates orthogonal gradient directions and momentum-based updates to expand counterattack space diversity, plus a directional sensitivity score for adaptive counterattack strength modulation.

Result: Extensive experiments on 16 datasets show DOC improves adversarial robustness under various attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

Conclusion: DOC successfully enhances adversarial robustness by increasing counterattack diversity and coverage, providing more effective test-time defense for vision-language models.

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training models (VLPs) demonstrate strong multimodal understanding and zero-shot generalization, yet remain vulnerable to adversarial examples, raising concerns about their reliability. Recent work, Test-Time Counterattack (TTC), improves robustness by generating perturbations that maximize the embedding deviation of adversarial inputs using PGD, pushing them away from their adversarial representations. However, due to the fundamental difference in optimization objectives between adversarial attacks and counterattacks, generating counterattacks solely based on gradients with respect to the adversarial input confines the search to a narrow space. As a result, the counterattacks could overfit limited adversarial patterns and lack the diversity to fully neutralize a broad range of perturbations. In this work, we argue that enhancing the diversity and coverage of counterattacks is crucial to improving adversarial robustness in test-time defense. Accordingly, we propose Directional Orthogonal Counterattack (DOC), which augments counterattack optimization by incorporating orthogonal gradient directions and momentum-based updates. This design expands the exploration of the counterattack space and increases the diversity of perturbations, which facilitates the discovery of more generalizable counterattacks and ultimately improves the ability to neutralize adversarial perturbations. Meanwhile, we present a directional sensitivity score based on averaged cosine similarity to boost DOC by improving example discrimination and adaptively modulating the counterattack strength. Extensive experiments on 16 datasets demonstrate that DOC improves adversarial robustness under various attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Composition-Incremental Learning (CompIL) for compositional generalization in CZSL tasks, with new benchmarks and a pseudo-replay framework using visual synthesis and linguistic distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data continually emerges with infinite, long-tailed compositions, requiring models to gradually improve compositional generalization capability incrementally rather than from pre-collected data.

Method: Pseudo-replay framework with visual synthesizer to synthesize representations of learned compositions and linguistic primitive distillation to maintain aligned primitive representations across learning.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed framework on newly developed benchmarks MIT-States-CompIL and C-GQA-CompIL.

Conclusion: The CompIL framework enables progressive improvement of compositional generalization capability through incremental learning of new compositions.

Abstract: Compositional generalization has achieved substantial progress in computer vision on pre-collected training data. Nonetheless, real-world data continually emerges, with possible compositions being nearly infinite, long-tailed, and not entirely visible. Thus, an ideal model is supposed to gradually improve the capability of compositional generalization in an incremental manner. In this paper, we explore Composition-Incremental Learning for Compositional Generalization (CompIL) in the context of the compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) task, where models need to continually learn new compositions, intending to improve their compositional generalization capability progressively. To quantitatively evaluate CompIL, we develop a benchmark construction pipeline leveraging existing datasets, yielding MIT-States-CompIL and C-GQA-CompIL. Furthermore, we propose a pseudo-replay framework utilizing a visual synthesizer to synthesize visual representations of learned compositions and a linguistic primitive distillation mechanism to maintain aligned primitive representations across the learning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

### [45] [Ultra-Light Test-Time Adaptation for Vision--Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09101)
*Byunghyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UL-TTA is a training-free, backprop-free test-time adaptation method for vision-language models that adapts only logit-level parameters (prototypes, priors, temperature) using online EM-style updates to handle domain shift without updating backbone parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs like CLIP suffer from feature drift, class-prior mismatch, and miscalibration under domain shift, while existing TTA methods require backpropagation, covariance estimation, or heavy memory, making them unsuitable for streaming and edge scenarios.

Method: Freezes backbone and adapts only logit-level parameters via online EM-style procedure with selective sample filtering, closed-form Bayesian updates for prototypes/priors, decoupled temperatures, and lightweight guards to prevent drift.

Result: Improves top-1 accuracy by +4.7 points over zero-shot CLIP on average across large-scale benchmarks, reduces ECE by 20-30%, with <8% latency overhead, and maintains stability in long streams up to 200K samples.

Conclusion: Logit-level Bayesian adaptation is sufficient for state-of-the-art accuracy-calibration trade-offs in VLMs under domain shift without updating backbone parameters, making it ideal for streaming and edge applications.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot recognition by comparing image embeddings to text-derived class prototypes. However, under domain shift, they suffer from feature drift, class-prior mismatch, and severe miscalibration. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often require backpropagation through large backbones, covariance estimation, or heavy memory/state, which is problematic for streaming and edge scenarios. We propose Ultra-Light Test-Time Adaptation (UL-TTA), a fully training-free and backprop-free framework that freezes the backbone and adapts only logit-level parameters: class prototypes, class priors, and temperature. UL-TTA performs an online EM-style procedure with (i) selective sample filtering to use only confident predictions, (ii) closed-form Bayesian updates for prototypes and priors anchored by text and Dirichlet priors, (iii) decoupled temperatures for prediction vs. calibration, and (iv) lightweight guards (norm clipping, prior KL constraints, smoothed temperature) to prevent drift in long streams. Across large-scale cross-domain and OOD benchmarks (PACS, Office-Home, DomainNet, Terra Incognita, ImageNet-R/A/V2/Sketch; ~726K test samples) and strong TTA baselines including Tent, T3A, CoTTA, SAR, Tip-Adapter, and FreeTTA, UL-TTA consistently improves top-1 accuracy (e.g., +4.7 points over zero-shot CLIP on average) while reducing ECE by 20-30%, with less than 8% latency overhead. Long-stream experiments up to 200K samples show no collapse. Our results demonstrate that logit-level Bayesian adaptation is sufficient to obtain state-of-the-art accuracy-calibration trade-offs for VLMs under domain shift, without updating any backbone parameters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DKDS, a new dataset for degraded Kuzushiji documents with seals, addressing OCR challenges from document degradation and seals that existing methods overlook.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OCR methods for Kuzushiji perform well on clean documents but fail on noisy ones with degradation and seals, and no existing dataset specifically addresses these challenges.

Method: Created DKDS dataset with expert assistance, defined two benchmark tracks: (1) text and seal detection using YOLO models, (2) document binarization using traditional algorithms, K-means clustering, and GAN-based methods.

Result: Provided baseline results for both tracks: YOLO models for detection, and various binarization methods including traditional algorithms, K-means combinations, and GAN-based approaches.

Conclusion: DKDS serves as a new benchmark for degraded Kuzushiji document analysis, with publicly available dataset and implementation code to advance research in this domain.

Abstract: Kuzushiji, a pre-modern Japanese cursive script, can currently be read and understood by only a few thousand trained experts in Japan. With the rapid development of deep learning, researchers have begun applying Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to transcribe Kuzushiji into modern Japanese. Although existing OCR methods perform well on clean pre-modern Japanese documents written in Kuzushiji, they often fail to consider various types of noise, such as document degradation and seals, which significantly affect recognition accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, no existing dataset specifically addresses these challenges. To address this gap, we introduce the Degraded Kuzushiji Documents with Seals (DKDS) dataset as a new benchmark for related tasks. We describe the dataset construction process, which required the assistance of a trained Kuzushiji expert, and define two benchmark tracks: (1) text and seal detection and (2) document binarization. For the text and seal detection track, we provide baseline results using multiple versions of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) models for detecting Kuzushiji characters and seals. For the document binarization track, we present baseline results from traditional binarization algorithms, traditional algorithms combined with K-means clustering, and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based methods. The DKDS dataset and the implementation code for baseline methods are available at https://ruiyangju.github.io/DKDS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional flood mapping methods like numerical modeling and aerial photography have limitations in efficiency and reliability, creating a need for more effective real-time flood prediction solutions.

Method: Uses an image-to-image generative framework to map Digital Elevation Models to flood depth predictions, conditioned on simplified inundation model (SPM) with hydrodynamic priors, and includes a transformer-based rainfall encoder for temporal dependencies.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on a 26 km study area in Tainan, Taiwan with 182 rainfall scenarios (24-720 mm over 24 hours), showing accurate real-time flood maps that capture causal relationships between rainfall, topography, SPM, and flooding.

Conclusion: PIFF provides an effective data-driven alternative for flood prediction and response, integrating physics-informed constraints with neural networks for efficient near real-time flood depth estimation.

Abstract: Flood mapping is crucial for assessing and mitigating flood impacts, yet traditional methods like numerical modeling and aerial photography face limitations in efficiency and reliability. To address these challenges, we propose PIFF, a physics-informed, flow-based generative neural network for near real-time flood depth estimation. Built on an image-to-image generative framework, it efficiently maps Digital Elevation Models (DEM) to flood depth predictions. The model is conditioned on a simplified inundation model (SPM) that embeds hydrodynamic priors into the training process. Additionally, a transformer-based rainfall encoder captures temporal dependencies in precipitation. Integrating physics-informed constraints with data-driven learning, PIFF captures the causal relationships between rainfall, topography, SPM, and flooding, replacing costly simulations with accurate, real-time flood maps. Using a 26 km study area in Tainan, Taiwan, with 182 rainfall scenarios ranging from 24 mm to 720 mm over 24 hours, our results demonstrate that PIFF offers an effective, data-driven alternative for flood prediction and response.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MACEval is a multi-agent continual evaluation network that provides dynamic, automated evaluation of large language models using role assignment and cascaded agent networks to address issues with traditional benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for large models are closed-ended, prone to overfitting due to data contamination, difficult to maintain, and heavily dependent on human curation, undermining evaluation credibility.

Method: Uses a multi-agent system with role assignment, in-process data generation, and evaluation routing through cascaded agent networks to create interactive, autonomous evaluation.

Result: Experiments on 9 open-ended tasks with 23 models show MACEval is human-free, efficient (reduces data/overhead), and flexible (migrates existing benchmarks via custom topologies).

Conclusion: MACEval provides a sustainable, longitudinal evaluation framework that can broaden future directions for large model evaluation by addressing limitations of traditional benchmarks.

Abstract: Hundreds of benchmarks dedicated to evaluating large models from multiple perspectives have been presented over the past few years. Albeit substantial efforts, most of them remain closed-ended and are prone to overfitting due to the potential data contamination in the ever-growing training corpus of large models, thereby undermining the credibility of the evaluation. Moreover, the increasing scale and scope of current benchmarks with transient metrics, as well as the heavily human-dependent curation procedure, pose significant challenges for timely maintenance and adaptation to gauge the advancing capabilities of large models. In this paper, we introduce MACEval, a \Multi-Agent Continual Evaluation network for dynamic evaluation of large models, and define a new set of metrics to quantify performance longitudinally and sustainably. MACEval adopts an interactive and autonomous evaluation mode that employs role assignment, in-process data generation, and evaluation routing through a cascaded agent network. Extensive experiments on 9 open-ended tasks with 23 participating large models demonstrate that MACEval is (1) human-free and automatic, mitigating laborious result processing with inter-agent judgment guided; (2) efficient and economical, reducing a considerable amount of data and overhead to obtain similar results compared to related benchmarks; and (3) flexible and scalable, migrating or integrating existing benchmarks via customized evaluation topologies. We hope that MACEval can broaden future directions of large model evaluation.

TL;DR: PressTrack-HMR is a top-down pipeline that recovers multi-person global human meshes from pressure signals, addressing the challenge of distinguishing intermingled pressure data from multiple individuals walking on tactile mats simultaneously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional vision-based human mesh recovery methods face limitations due to occlusions, lighting issues, and privacy concerns. Pressure-based approaches offer occlusion-free and privacy-friendly alternatives, but existing methods struggle with multi-person scenarios where pressure signals from different individuals are intermingled.

Method: A top-down pipeline using tracking-by-detection strategy to first identify and segment each individual's pressure signal from raw pressure data, then perform human mesh recovery for each extracted individual signal. Also built the MIP multi-person interaction pressure dataset.

Result: Achieved 89.2mm MPJPE and 112.6mm WA-MPJPE100, demonstrating excellent performance in multi-person human mesh recovery using pressure data.

Conclusion: The method showcases the potential of tactile mats for ubiquitous, privacy-preserving multi-person action recognition, successfully extending pressure-based human mesh recovery to multi-person scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-person global human mesh recovery (HMR) is crucial for understanding crowd dynamics and interactions. Traditional vision-based HMR methods sometimes face limitations in real-world scenarios due to mutual occlusions, insufficient lighting, and privacy concerns. Human-floor tactile interactions offer an occlusion-free and privacy-friendly alternative for capturing human motion. Existing research indicates that pressure signals acquired from tactile mats can effectively estimate human pose in single-person scenarios. However, when multiple individuals walk randomly on the mat simultaneously, how to distinguish intermingled pressure signals generated by different persons and subsequently acquire individual temporal pressure data remains a pending challenge for extending pressure-based HMR to the multi-person situation. In this paper, we present \textbf{PressTrack-HMR}, a top-down pipeline that recovers multi-person global human meshes solely from pressure signals. This pipeline leverages a tracking-by-detection strategy to first identify and segment each individual's pressure signal from the raw pressure data, and subsequently performs HMR for each extracted individual signal. Furthermore, we build a multi-person interaction pressure dataset \textbf{MIP}, which facilitates further research into pressure-based human motion analysis in multi-person scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in multi-person HMR using pressure data, with 89.2~$mm$ MPJPE and 112.6~$mm$ WA-MPJPE$_{100}$, and these showcase the potential of tactile mats for ubiquitous, privacy-preserving multi-person action recognition.

Abstract: This article presents HOTFLoc++, an end-to-end framework for LiDAR place recognition, re-ranking, and 6-DoF metric localisation in forests. Leveraging an octree-based transformer, our approach extracts hierarchical local descriptors at multiple granularities to increase robustness to clutter, self-similarity, and viewpoint changes in challenging scenarios, including ground-to-ground and ground-to-aerial in forest and urban environments.

Our coarse-to-fine registration approach achieves comparable or lower localisation errors to baselines, with runtime improvements of two orders of magnitude over RANSAC for dense point clouds. Experimental results on public datasets show the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average Recall@1 of 90.7% on CS-Wild-Places: an improvement of 29.6 percentage points over baselines, while maintaining high performance on single-source benchmarks with an average Recall@1 of 91.7% and 96.0% on Wild-Places and MulRan, respectively. Our method achieves under 2 m and 5 degrees error for 97.2% of 6-DoF registration attempts, with our multi-scale re-ranking module reducing localisation errors by ~2$\times$ on average.

TL;DR: DBINDS is a diffusion-model-inversion based detector that analyzes latent-space dynamics to distinguish AI-generated videos from real ones, achieving strong cross-generator generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-generated video poses serious challenges to content security and forensic analysis, and existing detectors relying on pixel-level visual cues generalize poorly to unseen generators.

Method: Uses diffusion model inversion to recover initial noise sequences, forms Initial Noise Difference Sequence (INDS), extracts multi-domain multi-scale features, and employs feature optimization with LightGBM classifier tuned by Bayesian search.

Result: DBINDS achieves strong cross-generator performance on GenVidBench when trained on a single generator, demonstrating good generalization and robustness in limited-data settings.

Conclusion: Analyzing latent-space dynamics through diffusion inversion provides a more effective approach for AI-generated video detection than pixel-level methods, enabling better generalization across different generators.

Abstract: AI-generated video has advanced rapidly and poses serious challenges to content security and forensic analysis. Existing detectors rely mainly on pixel-level visual cues and generalize poorly to unseen generators. We propose DBINDS, a diffusion-model-inversion based detector that analyzes latent-space dynamics rather than pixels. We find that initial noise sequences recovered by diffusion inversion differ systematically between real and generated videos. Building on this, DBINDS forms an Initial Noise Difference Sequence (INDS) and extracts multi-domain, multi-scale features. With feature optimization and a LightGBM classifier tuned by Bayesian search, DBINDS (trained on a single generator) achieves strong cross-generator performance on GenVidBench, demonstrating good generalization and robustness in limited-data settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable evaluation is the primary bottleneck for responsible clinical deployment of multimodal LLMs in dermatology diagnostics, as current methods lack clinical meaningfulness, reproducibility, and scalability.

Method: Developed DermBench (4,000 real-world dermatology images with expert-certified narratives) and DermEval (reference-free multimodal evaluator) that uses LLM-based judges to score narratives across clinically grounded dimensions and provide structured critiques.

Result: Experiments on 4,500 cases show DermBench and DermEval achieve close alignment with expert ratings (mean deviations of 0.251 and 0.117 out of 5), providing reliable measurement of diagnostic ability and trustworthiness across different multimodal LLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables clinically meaningful, reproducible, and scalable assessment of multimodal LLMs in dermatology, addressing the critical need for reliable evaluation in clinical deployment.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate dermatology diagnostic narratives directly from images. However, reliable evaluation remains the primary bottleneck for responsible clinical deployment. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines DermBench, a meticulously curated benchmark, with DermEval, a robust automatic evaluator, to enable clinically meaningful, reproducible, and scalable assessment. We build DermBench, which pairs 4,000 real-world dermatology images with expert-certified diagnostic narratives and uses an LLM-based judge to score candidate narratives across clinically grounded dimensions, enabling consistent and comprehensive evaluation of multimodal models. For individual case assessment, we train DermEval, a reference-free multimodal evaluator. Given an image and a generated narrative, DermEval produces a structured critique along with an overall score and per-dimension ratings. This capability enables fine-grained, per-case analysis, which is critical for identifying model limitations and biases. Experiments on a diverse dataset of 4,500 cases demonstrate that DermBench and DermEval achieve close alignment with expert ratings, with mean deviations of 0.251 and 0.117 (out of 5), respectively, providing reliable measurement of diagnostic ability and trustworthiness across different multimodal LLMs.

Motivation: MLLMs often suffer from hallucinations (errors in object existence, attributes, or relations) which undermine their reliability, creating a need for methods to mitigate these issues without external vision experts.

Method: TACO decomposes responses into atomic queries, paraphrases them to reduce wording sensitivity, estimates confidence using self-consistency (black-box) or self-confidence (gray-box) aggregation, and refines answers with a language model.

Result: Experiments on five benchmarks with two MLLMs show TACO consistently outperforms direct prompting and Visual Contrastive Decoding, reduces systematic biases, and improves confidence calibration.

Conclusion: TACO effectively enhances the faithfulness of MLLMs by mitigating hallucinations through self-verification and confidence calibration without relying on external vision experts.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often suffer from hallucinations, particularly errors in object existence, attributes, or relations, which undermine their reliability. We introduce TACO (Verified Atomic Confidence Estimation), a simple framework that mitigates hallucinations through self-verification and confidence calibration without relying on external vision experts. TACO decomposes responses into atomic queries, paraphrases them to reduce sensitivity to wording, and estimates confidence using self-consistency (black-box) or self-confidence (gray-box) aggregation, before refining answers with a language model.

TL;DR: Proposes Spatial Information Bottleneck (S-IB) to spatially disentangle neural network representations by optimizing Vector-Jacobian Products during training, improving attribution quality across explanation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks learn spatially entangled representations that mix discriminative foreground features with spurious background correlations, undermining interpretability and robustness.

Method: Proves Vector-Jacobian Products (VJP) form minimal sufficient statistics, then introduces Spatial Information Bottleneck (S-IB) that maximizes mutual information between foreground VJP and inputs while minimizing background information.

Result: Experiments on five benchmarks show universal improvements across six explanation methods, achieving better foreground concentration and background suppression without method-specific tuning, with consistent classification accuracy gains.

Conclusion: Directly optimizing VJP's spatial structure during training improves visualization quality across diverse explanation paradigms by encouraging networks to encode information only in class-relevant spatial regions.

Abstract: Deep neural networks typically learn spatially entangled representations that conflate discriminative foreground features with spurious background correlations, thereby undermining model interpretability and robustness. We propose a novel understanding framework for gradient-based attribution from an information-theoretic perspective. We prove that, under mild conditions, the Vector-Jacobian Products (VJP) computed during backpropagation form minimal sufficient statistics of input features with respect to class labels. Motivated by this finding, we propose an encoding-decoding perspective : forward propagation encodes inputs into class space, while VJP in backpropagation decodes this encoding back to feature space. Therefore, we propose Spatial Information Bottleneck (S-IB) to spatially disentangle information flow. By maximizing mutual information between foreground VJP and inputs while minimizing mutual information in background regions, S-IB encourages networks to encode information only in class-relevant spatial regions. Since post-hoc explanation methods fundamentally derive from VJP computations, directly optimizing VJP's spatial structure during training improves visualization quality across diverse explanation paradigms. Experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate universal improvements across six explanation methods, achieving better foreground concentration and background suppression without method-specific tuning, alongside consistent classification accuracy gains.

Motivation: AGC deployment on edge devices faces challenges due to high parameter count, algorithm inflexibility, and power consumption from extensive computations and data transmission.

Method: Network compression via post-training static quantization and layer fusion, co-processor paradigm with hardware engines (convolution, grid sampling, upsample), parallelization with double-buffered pipelines and loop unrolling.

Result: Achieved 24.9× higher energy efficiency vs CPU and 4.1× vs GPU, requiring only 11.7 μJ per reconstructed pixel on PYNQ-Z1 FPGA platform.

Conclusion: FPGA-based deployment scheme enables efficient AGC implementation on resource-constrained edge devices with significantly improved energy efficiency.

Abstract: The Animation-based Generative Codec (AGC) is an emerging paradigm for talking-face video compression. However, deploying its intricate decoder on resource and power-constrained edge devices presents challenges due to numerous parameters, the inflexibility to adapt to dynamically evolving algorithms, and the high power consumption induced by extensive computations and data transmission. This paper for the first time proposes a novel field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)-oriented AGC deployment scheme for edge-computing video services. Initially, we analyze the AGC algorithm and employ network compression methods including post-training static quantization and layer fusion techniques. Subsequently, we design an overlapped accelerator utilizing the co-processor paradigm to perform computations through software-hardware co-design. The hardware processing unit comprises engines such as convolution, grid sampling, upsample, etc. Parallelization optimization strategies like double-buffered pipelines and loop unrolling are employed to fully exploit the resources of FPGA. Ultimately, we establish an AGC FPGA prototype on the PYNQ-Z1 platform using the proposed scheme, achieving \textbf{24.9$\times$} and \textbf{4.1$\times$} higher energy efficiency against commercial Central Processing Unit (CPU) and Graphic Processing Unit (GPU), respectively. Specifically, only \textbf{11.7} microjoules ($\upmu$J) are required for one pixel reconstructed by this FPGA system.

Motivation: Existing deep learning approaches for energy expenditure estimation rarely disentangle neural architecture effects from signal choice effects, and there's a need to systematically evaluate both aspects.

Method: Compared classical baselines with newer neural architectures (CNN, ResNet, transformers) across single signals, signal pairs, and grouped sensor inputs from Hexoskin smart shirt for diverse physical activities.

Result: Transformer model with minute ventilation achieved lowest RMSE (0.87 W/kg); better results in low-intensity activities (RMSE down to 0.29 W/kg); strong inter-individual variability observed.

Conclusion: Minute ventilation is most predictive individual signal; adaptive modeling strategies needed due to strong inter-individual variability; code and models publicly available.

Abstract: Energy expenditure estimation aims to infer human metabolic rate from physiological signals such as heart rate, respiration, or accelerometer data, and has been studied primarily with classical regression methods. The few existing deep learning approaches rarely disentangle the role of neural architecture from that of signal choice. In this work, we systematically evaluate both aspects. We compare classical baselines with newer neural architectures across single signals, signal pairs, and grouped sensor inputs for diverse physical activities. Our results show that minute ventilation is the most predictive individual signal, with a transformer model achieving the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.87 W/kg across all activities. Paired and grouped signals, such as those from the Hexoskin smart shirt (five signals), offer good alternatives for faster models like CNN and ResNet with attention. Per-activity evaluation revealed mixed outcomes: notably better results in low-intensity activities (RMSE down to 0.29 W/kg; NRMSE = 0.04), while higher-intensity tasks showed larger RMSE but more comparable normalized errors. Finally, subject-level analysis highlights strong inter-individual variability, motivating the need for adaptive modeling strategies. Our code and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/Sarvibabakhani/deeplearning-biosignals-ee .

*Amir M. Mansourian,Amir Mohammad Babaei,Shohreh Kasaei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RichKD enhances multi-teacher knowledge distillation by incorporating CLIP's vision-language knowledge alongside conventional visual teachers, improving accuracy, confidence, and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-teacher KD methods lack knowledge diversity as they rely only on unimodal visual information, missing the potential of cross-modal representations from vision-language models like CLIP.

Method: Proposes a framework that fuses logits and features from conventional teachers with those from CLIP, incorporating multi-prompt textual guidance to capture both dataset-specific and semantically enriched visual cues.

Result: Consistently outperforms most existing baselines across multiple benchmarks, increases confident-correct predictions while reducing confidently wrong ones, and shows stronger robustness under distribution shifts and input corruptions.

Conclusion: RichKD demonstrates that incorporating CLIP's vision-language knowledge as complementary supervision significantly improves knowledge distillation quality, producing more confident and semantically meaningful predictions.

Abstract: Multi-teacher knowledge distillation (KD), a more effective technique than traditional single-teacher methods, transfers knowledge from expert teachers to a compact student model using logit or feature matching. However, most existing approaches lack knowledge diversity, as they rely solely on unimodal visual information, overlooking the potential of cross-modal representations. In this work, we explore the use of CLIP's vision-language knowledge as a complementary source of supervision for KD, an area that remains largely underexplored. We propose a simple yet effective framework that fuses the logits and features of a conventional teacher with those from CLIP. By incorporating CLIP's multi-prompt textual guidance, the fused supervision captures both dataset-specific and semantically enriched visual cues. Beyond accuracy, analysis shows that the fused teacher yields more confident and reliable predictions, significantly increasing confident-correct cases while reducing confidently wrong ones. Moreover, fusion with CLIP refines the entire logit distribution, producing semantically meaningful probabilities for non-target classes, thereby improving inter-class consistency and distillation quality. Despite its simplicity, the proposed method, Enriching Knowledge Distillation (RichKD), consistently outperforms most existing baselines across multiple benchmarks and exhibits stronger robustness under distribution shifts and input corruptions.

*Shengqi Dang,Fu Chai,Jiaxin Li,Chao Yuan,Wei Ye,Nan Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DensiCrafter generates lightweight, self-supporting 3D hollow structures by optimizing density fields from coarse voxel grids, achieving up to 43% material reduction while maintaining geometric fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D generative models ignore physical constraints and manufacturability, particularly the need for lightweight and self-supporting structures suitable for 3D printing.

Method: Optimizes continuous density fields from Trellis-generated voxel grids using three differentiable, physically constrained loss terms and mass regularization, while preserving outer surfaces.

Result: Achieves up to 43% material mass reduction in text-to-3D tasks, improves stability compared to baselines, and produces reliably fabricable self-supporting structures.

Conclusion: DensiCrafter successfully bridges the gap between generative 3D modeling and physical manufacturability, enabling automatic creation of lightweight, self-supporting structures without architectural changes to existing models.

Abstract: The rise of 3D generative models has enabled automatic 3D geometry and texture synthesis from multimodal inputs (e.g., text or images). However, these methods often ignore physical constraints and manufacturability considerations. In this work, we address the challenge of producing 3D designs that are both lightweight and self-supporting. We present DensiCrafter, a framework for generating lightweight, self-supporting 3D hollow structures by optimizing the density field. Starting from coarse voxel grids produced by Trellis, we interpret these as continuous density fields to optimize and introduce three differentiable, physically constrained, and simulation-free loss terms. Additionally, a mass regularization penalizes unnecessary material, while a restricted optimization domain preserves the outer surface. Our method seamlessly integrates with pretrained Trellis-based models (e.g., Trellis, DSO) without any architectural changes. In extensive evaluations, we achieve up to 43% reduction in material mass on the text-to-3D task. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our method could improve the stability and maintain high geometric fidelity. Real-world 3D-printing experiments confirm that our hollow designs can be reliably fabricated and could be self-supporting.

*Le Yi,Wei Huang,Lei Zhang,Kefu Zhao,Yan Wang,Zizhou Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A feedback mechanism is introduced into teacher-student framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation to counteract error reconfirmation and self-reinforcing bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Teacher-student paradigm in medical image segmentation is vulnerable to erroneous supervision due to image ambiguities, leading to self-reinforcing bias through iterative error reconfirmation.

Method: Introduces feedback mechanism where student provides feedback on teacher's pseudo-label changes, with feedback attributor and receiver components. Proposes dual-teacher feedback model for dynamic feedback loop and cross-teacher supervision.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on three medical image benchmarks demonstrate effectiveness in addressing error propagation.

Conclusion: The feedback mechanism successfully mitigates error propagation in semi-supervised medical image segmentation by enabling teacher refinement through student feedback.

Abstract: The teacher-student paradigm has emerged as a canonical framework in semi-supervised learning. When applied to medical image segmentation, the paradigm faces challenges due to inherent image ambiguities, making it particularly vulnerable to erroneous supervision. Crucially, the student's iterative reconfirmation of these errors leads to self-reinforcing bias. While some studies attempt to mitigate this bias, they often rely on external modifications to the conventional teacher-student framework, overlooking its intrinsic potential for error correction. In response, this work introduces a feedback mechanism into the teacher-student framework to counteract error reconfirmations. Here, the student provides feedback on the changes induced by the teacher's pseudo-labels, enabling the teacher to refine these labels accordingly. We specify that this interaction hinges on two key components: the feedback attributor, which designates pseudo-labels triggering the student's update, and the feedback receiver, which determines where to apply this feedback. Building on this, a dual-teacher feedback model is further proposed, which allows more dynamics in the feedback loop and fosters more gains by resolving disagreements through cross-teacher supervision while avoiding consistent errors. Comprehensive evaluations on three medical image benchmarks demonstrate the method's effectiveness in addressing error propagation in semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

### [60] [FQ-PETR: Fully Quantized Position Embedding Transformation for Multi-View 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09347)
*Jiangyong Yu,Changyong Shu,Sifan Zhou,Zichen Yu,Xing Hu,Yan Chen,Dawei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FQ-PETR is a fully quantized framework for PETR-based 3D detection models that addresses quantization challenges through three innovations: QFPE for scale alignment, DULUT for non-linear function approximation, and QANS for attention stabilization, achieving near-floating-point accuracy with 75% latency reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PETR-based 3D detection models face deployment challenges due to high computational cost and memory footprint. Direct quantization causes severe accuracy degradation due to multi-modal feature disparity and inefficient non-linear operator quantization.

Method: Three key innovations: (1) QFPE replaces multi-point sampling with LiDAR-prior-guided single-point sampling and anchor-based embedding, (2) DULUT approximates complex non-linear functions using cascaded linear lookup tables, (3) QANS performs quantization after softmax numerical stabilization.

Result: FQ-PETR achieves near-floating-point accuracy (only 1% degradation) under W8A8 quantization while reducing latency by up to 75%, significantly outperforming existing PTQ and QAT baselines across PETR variants.

Conclusion: FQ-PETR successfully enables efficient deployment of PETR-based 3D detection models through targeted quantization solutions, maintaining high accuracy while dramatically reducing computational requirements.

Abstract: Camera-based multi-view 3D detection is crucial for autonomous driving. PETR and its variants (PETRs) excel in benchmarks but face deployment challenges due to high computational cost and memory footprint. Quantization is an effective technique for compressing deep neural networks by reducing the bit width of weights and activations. However, directly applying existing quantization methods to PETRs leads to severe accuracy degradation. This issue primarily arises from two key challenges: (1) significant magnitude disparity between multi-modal features-specifically, image features and camera-ray positional embeddings (PE), and (2) the inefficiency and approximation error of quantizing non-linear operators, which commonly rely on hardware-unfriendly computations. In this paper, we propose FQ-PETR, a fully quantized framework for PETRs, featuring three key innovations: (1) Quantization-Friendly LiDAR-ray Position Embedding (QFPE): Replacing multi-point sampling with LiDAR-prior-guided single-point sampling and anchor-based embedding eliminates problematic non-linearities (e.g., inverse-sigmoid) and aligns PE scale with image features, preserving accuracy. (2) Dual-Lookup Table (DULUT): This algorithm approximates complex non-linear functions using two cascaded linear LUTs, achieving high fidelity with minimal entries and no specialized hardware. (3) Quantization After Numerical Stabilization (QANS): Performing quantization after softmax numerical stabilization mitigates attention distortion from large inputs. On PETRs (e.g. PETR, StreamPETR, PETRv2, MV2d), FQ-PETR under W8A8 achieves near-floating-point accuracy (1% degradation) while reducing latency by up to 75%, significantly outperforming existing PTQ and QAT baselines.

*Houzhang Fang,Shukai Guo,Qiuhuan Chen,Yi Chang,Luxin Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TDCNet is a novel moving infrared small target detection network that combines temporal difference and 3D convolution through re-parameterized modules to enhance spatio-temporal feature extraction for accurate target detection in complex backgrounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Moving IRSTD is challenging due to weak target features and complex background interference. Existing methods using temporal differences lack spatial feature extraction capability, while 3D convolutions lack explicit motion awareness.

Method: Proposes TDCNet with temporal difference convolution (TDC) re-parameterization module containing three parallel TDC blocks that fuse temporal difference and 3D convolution. Also introduces TDC-guided spatio-temporal attention mechanism for cross-attention between TDC-based and 3D backbone features.

Result: Extensive experiments on IRSTD-UAV and public infrared datasets show TDCNet achieves state-of-the-art detection performance in moving target detection.

Conclusion: The proposed TDCNet effectively captures multi-scale motion contextual features while suppressing pseudo-motion clutter, significantly improving moving infrared small target detection performance.

Abstract: Moving infrared small target detection (IRSTD) plays a critical role in practical applications, such as surveillance of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and UAV-based search system. Moving IRSTD still remains highly challenging due to weak target features and complex background interference. Accurate spatio-temporal feature modeling is crucial for moving target detection, typically achieved through either temporal differences or spatio-temporal (3D) convolutions. Temporal difference can explicitly leverage motion cues but exhibits limited capability in extracting spatial features, whereas 3D convolution effectively represents spatio-temporal features yet lacks explicit awareness of motion dynamics along the temporal dimension. In this paper, we propose a novel moving IRSTD network (TDCNet), which effectively extracts and enhances spatio-temporal features for accurate target detection. Specifically, we introduce a novel temporal difference convolution (TDC) re-parameterization module that comprises three parallel TDC blocks designed to capture contextual dependencies across different temporal ranges. Each TDC block fuses temporal difference and 3D convolution into a unified spatio-temporal convolution representation. This re-parameterized module can effectively capture multi-scale motion contextual features while suppressing pseudo-motion clutter in complex backgrounds, significantly improving detection performance. Moreover, we propose a TDC-guided spatio-temporal attention mechanism that performs cross-attention between the spatio-temporal features from the TDC-based backbone and a parallel 3D backbone. This mechanism models their global semantic dependencies to refine the current frame's features. Extensive experiments on IRSTD-UAV and public infrared datasets demonstrate that our TDCNet achieves state-of-the-art detection performance in moving target detection.

TL;DR: Flora is a zero-shot skeleton action recognition method that addresses imperfect point-to-point alignment and rigid classifiers through flexible neighbor-aware semantic attunement and open-form distribution-aware flow classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot skeleton action recognition methods face two fundamental issues: fragile point-to-point alignment from imperfect semantics, and rigid classifiers with static decision boundaries and coarse-grained anchors.

Method: Uses flexible neighbor-aware semantic attunement with cross-modal geometric consistency for robust point-to-region alignment, and employs noise-free flow matching with condition-free contrastive regularization to bridge modality distribution gaps and create fine-grained decision boundaries.

Result: Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show effective performance, with impressive results even when trained with only 10% of seen data.

Conclusion: Flora successfully addresses the limitations of existing approaches by providing stable alignment and distribution-aware classification, demonstrating strong zero-shot skeleton action recognition capabilities.

Abstract: Recognizing unseen skeleton action categories remains highly challenging due to the absence of corresponding skeletal priors. Existing approaches generally follow an "align-then-classify" paradigm but face two fundamental issues, i.e., (i) fragile point-to-point alignment arising from imperfect semantics, and (ii) rigid classifiers restricted by static decision boundaries and coarse-grained anchors. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for zero-shot skeleton action recognition, termed $\texttt{$\textbf{Flora}$}$, which builds upon $\textbf{F}$lexib$\textbf{L}$e neighb$\textbf{O}$r-aware semantic attunement and open-form dist$\textbf{R}$ibution-aware flow cl$\textbf{A}$ssifier. Specifically, we flexibly attune textual semantics by incorporating neighboring inter-class contextual cues to form direction-aware regional semantics, coupled with a cross-modal geometric consistency objective that ensures stable and robust point-to-region alignment. Furthermore, we employ noise-free flow matching to bridge the modality distribution gap between semantic and skeleton latent embeddings, while a condition-free contrastive regularization enhances discriminability, leading to a distribution-aware classifier with fine-grained decision boundaries achieved through token-level velocity predictions. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our method, showing particularly impressive performance even when trained with only 10\% of the seen data.

TL;DR: OUGS introduces an object-aware uncertainty formulation for 3D Gaussian Splatting that uses physical Gaussian parameters and semantic segmentation to improve active reconstruction of specific objects in complex scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing active reconstruction methods for 3DGS rely on scene-level uncertainty metrics that are biased by background clutter, leading to inefficient view selection for object-centric tasks.

Method: Derives uncertainty directly from explicit physical parameters of 3D Gaussian primitives (position, scale, rotation) by propagating covariance through rendering Jacobian, then integrates semantic segmentation masks for object-aware uncertainty scoring.

Result: Significantly improves efficiency of 3DGS reconstruction process and achieves higher quality for targeted objects compared to state-of-the-art methods, while serving as robust uncertainty estimator for global scene.

Conclusion: OUGS provides a principled, physically-grounded uncertainty formulation that enables more effective active view selection for object-centric 3D reconstruction in complex scenes.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved state-of-the-art results for novel view synthesis. However, efficiently capturing high-fidelity reconstructions of specific objects within complex scenes remains a significant challenge. A key limitation of existing active reconstruction methods is their reliance on scene-level uncertainty metrics, which are often biased by irrelevant background clutter and lead to inefficient view selection for object-centric tasks. We present OUGS, a novel framework that addresses this challenge with a more principled, physically-grounded uncertainty formulation for 3DGS. Our core innovation is to derive uncertainty directly from the explicit physical parameters of the 3D Gaussian primitives (e.g., position, scale, rotation). By propagating the covariance of these parameters through the rendering Jacobian, we establish a highly interpretable uncertainty model. This foundation allows us to then seamlessly integrate semantic segmentation masks to produce a targeted, object-aware uncertainty score that effectively disentangles the object from its environment. This allows for a more effective active view selection strategy that prioritizes views critical to improving object fidelity. Experimental evaluations on public datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the efficiency of the 3DGS reconstruction process and achieves higher quality for targeted objects compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, while also serving as a robust uncertainty estimator for the global scene.

TL;DR: A vision-based framework for bronchoscope tip localization using 2D-3D registration between endoscopic views and CT scans, with a new synthetic benchmark dataset for standardized evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate bronchoscope localization is challenging due to respiratory motion, anatomical variability, and CT-to-body divergence, causing misalignment between intra-operative views and pre-operative CT. Existing vision-based methods fail to generalize across domains and patients.

Method: Proposes a vision-based pose optimization framework with a fine-tuned modality- and domain-invariant encoder for direct similarity computation between real endoscopic RGB frames and CT-rendered depth maps, plus a differentiable rendering module for iterative camera pose refinement through depth consistency.

Result: Achieves average translational error of 2.65 mm and rotational error of 0.19 rad when trained on synthetic data distinct from the benchmark. Qualitative results on real patient data show strong cross-domain generalization with consistent frame-wise 2D-3D alignment without domain-specific adaptation.

Conclusion: The framework achieves robust, domain-invariant localization through iterative vision-based optimization, while the new benchmark provides a foundation for standardized progress in vision-based bronchoscopy navigation.

Abstract: Accurate intra-operative localization of the bronchoscope tip relative to patient anatomy remains challenging due to respiratory motion, anatomical variability, and CT-to-body divergence that cause deformation and misalignment between intra-operative views and pre-operative CT. Existing vision-based methods often fail to generalize across domains and patients, leading to residual alignment errors. This work establishes a generalizable foundation for bronchoscopy navigation through a robust vision-based framework and a new synthetic benchmark dataset that enables standardized and reproducible evaluation. We propose a vision-based pose optimization framework for frame-wise 2D-3D registration between intra-operative endoscopic views and pre-operative CT anatomy. A fine-tuned modality- and domain-invariant encoder enables direct similarity computation between real endoscopic RGB frames and CT-rendered depth maps, while a differentiable rendering module iteratively refines camera poses through depth consistency. To enhance reproducibility, we introduce the first public synthetic benchmark dataset for bronchoscopy navigation, addressing the lack of paired CT-endoscopy data. Trained exclusively on synthetic data distinct from the benchmark, our model achieves an average translational error of 2.65 mm and a rotational error of 0.19 rad, demonstrating accurate and stable localization. Qualitative results on real patient data further confirm strong cross-domain generalization, achieving consistent frame-wise 2D-3D alignment without domain-specific adaptation. Overall, the proposed framework achieves robust, domain-invariant localization through iterative vision-based optimization, while the new benchmark provides a foundation for standardized progress in vision-based bronchoscopy navigation.

TL;DR: Created first American football player tracking dataset and benchmarked detection/tracking methods, showing improved performance with fine-tuned models in crowded scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: No standardized dataset exists for American football player tracking despite unique challenges like frequent occlusion and physical contact, making fair method comparisons difficult.

Method: Constructed dedicated detection/tracking dataset for American football players, then evaluated various detection and tracking methods including fine-tuned detection models and re-identification models integrated into tracking systems.

Result: Fine-tuned detection models outperformed pre-trained models, and integrating fine-tuned detectors with re-identification models significantly improved tracking accuracy in crowded scenarios compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: This work enables robust detection and tracking of American football players in challenging, high-density scenarios that were previously underserved by conventional methods.

Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) plays a critical role in analyzing player behavior from videos, enabling performance evaluation. Current MOT methods are often evaluated using publicly available datasets. However, most of these focus on everyday scenarios such as pedestrian tracking or are tailored to specific sports, including soccer and basketball. Despite the inherent challenges of tracking players in American football, such as frequent occlusion and physical contact, no standardized dataset has been publicly available, making fair comparisons between methods difficult. To address this gap, we constructed the first dedicated detection and tracking dataset for the American football players and conducted a comparative evaluation of various detection and tracking methods. Our results demonstrate that accurate detection and tracking can be achieved even in crowded scenarios. Fine-tuning detection models improved performance over pre-trained models. Furthermore, when these fine-tuned detectors and re-identification models were integrated into tracking systems, we observed notable improvements in tracking accuracy compared to existing approaches. This work thus enables robust detection and tracking of American football players in challenging, high-density scenarios previously underserved by conventional methods.

TL;DR: Proposes Dual-Teacher Knowledge Distillation framework using both ViT and CNN teachers to guide lightweight CNN student, addressing architectural mismatch in cross-architecture distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve strong video action recognition but are computationally expensive, while lightweight CNNs are efficient but less accurate. Existing cross-architecture distillation methods struggle with architectural mismatch and overlook stronger CNN teachers.

Method: Dual-Teacher framework with: 1) Discrepancy-Aware Teacher Weighting that dynamically fuses ViT and CNN teacher predictions based on confidence and student discrepancy; 2) Structure Discrepancy-Aware Distillation where student learns residual features between ViT and CNN teachers via auxiliary branch.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art distillation approaches on HMDB51, EPIC-KITCHENS-100, and Kinetics-400 benchmarks, achieving up to 5.95% accuracy gain on HMDB51.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-teacher framework effectively addresses architectural mismatch in knowledge distillation and consistently improves lightweight CNN performance for video action recognition.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved strong performance in video action recognition, but their high computational cost limits their practicality. Lightweight CNNs are more efficient but suffer from accuracy gaps. Cross-Architecture Knowledge Distillation (CAKD) addresses this by transferring knowledge from ViTs to CNNs, yet existing methods often struggle with architectural mismatch and overlook the value of stronger homogeneous CNN teachers. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Dual-Teacher Knowledge Distillation framework that leverages both a heterogeneous ViT teacher and a homogeneous CNN teacher to collaboratively guide a lightweight CNN student. We introduce two key components: (1) Discrepancy-Aware Teacher Weighting, which dynamically fuses the predictions from ViT and CNN teachers by assigning adaptive weights based on teacher confidence and prediction discrepancy with the student, enabling more informative and effective supervision; and (2) a Structure Discrepancy-Aware Distillation strategy, where the student learns the residual features between ViT and CNN teachers via a lightweight auxiliary branch, focusing on transferable architectural differences without mimicking all of ViT's high-dimensional patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including HMDB51, EPIC-KITCHENS-100, and Kinetics-400 demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation approaches, achieving notable performance improvements with a maximum accuracy gain of 5.95% on HMDB51.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely solely on geometric cues and predict poses independently, limiting their ability to resolve ambiguous motions and generalize to real-world scenarios. The paper is inspired by how humans understand and anticipate motion.

Method: Uses diffusion-based framework with action prompts extracted from 2D pose sequences, a representation encoder with kinematic joint affinity in attention mechanism, and a hallucinative pose decoder for temporal coherence.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Human3.6M and MPI-3DHP datasets. Demonstrates strong robustness on broadcast baseball dataset despite ambiguous and noisy 2D inputs, effectively handling temporal consistency and intent-driven motion variations.

Conclusion: DreamPose3D successfully combines action-aware reasoning with temporal imagination for 3D pose estimation, showing improved performance and robustness in handling ambiguous motions and real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate 3D human pose estimation remains a critical yet unresolved challenge, requiring both temporal coherence across frames and fine-grained modeling of joint relationships. However, most existing methods rely solely on geometric cues and predict each 3D pose independently, which limits their ability to resolve ambiguous motions and generalize to real-world scenarios. Inspired by how humans understand and anticipate motion, we introduce DreamPose3D, a diffusion-based framework that combines action-aware reasoning with temporal imagination for 3D pose estimation. DreamPose3D dynamically conditions the denoising process using task-relevant action prompts extracted from 2D pose sequences, capturing high-level intent. To model the structural relationships between joints effectively, we introduce a representation encoder that incorporates kinematic joint affinity into the attention mechanism. Finally, a hallucinative pose decoder predicts temporally coherent 3D pose sequences during training, simulating how humans mentally reconstruct motion trajectories to resolve ambiguity in perception. Extensive experiments on benchmarked Human3.6M and MPI-3DHP datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all metrics. To further validate DreamPose3D's robustness, we tested it on a broadcast baseball dataset, where it demonstrated strong performance despite ambiguous and noisy 2D inputs, effectively handling temporal consistency and intent-driven motion variations.

*Saba Asaad,Chongjun Ouyang,Ali Bereyhi,Zhiguo Ding*

TL;DR: The paper analyzes energy efficiency in pinching-antenna systems (PASSs) and develops hybrid algorithms that dynamically tune pinching locations while statically adjusting couplings to maximize energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the energy efficiency of pinching-antenna systems (PASSs) where power distribution is implicitly controlled through pinching parameters rather than explicit power allocation policies.

Method: Developed hybrid dynamic-static algorithms that tune pinching locations dynamically (for low mobility scenarios) and adjust pinching couplings statically (due to slower tuning capability), with pinching locations controlled via movable elements and couplings adjusted through effective coupling length variation.

Result: Experimental results show that dynamic tuning of pinching locations significantly boosts the energy efficiency of PASSs.

Conclusion: Hybrid dynamic-static parameter tuning, particularly dynamic adjustment of pinching locations, can substantially enhance the energy efficiency of pinching-antenna systems.

Abstract: We study the energy efficiency of pinching-antenna systems (PASSs) by developing a consistent formulation for power distribution in these systems. The per-antenna power distribution in PASSs is not controlled explicitly by a power allocation policy, but rather implicitly through tuning of pinching couplings and locations. Both these factors are tunable: (i) pinching locations are tuned using movable elements, and (ii) couplings can be tuned by varying the effective coupling length of the pinching elements. While the former is feasible to be addressed dynamically in settings with low user mobility, the latter cannot be addressed at a high rate. We thus develop a class of hybrid dynamic-static algorithms, which maximize the energy efficiency by updating the system parameters at different rates. Our experimental results depict that dynamic tuning of pinching locations can significantly boost energy efficiency of PASSs.

TL;DR: SSMRadNet is a multi-scale State Space Model-based detector for FMCW radar that processes raw ADC samples through two SSMs for chirp-wise and frame-wise feature learning, achieving competitive performance with significantly fewer parameters and computations than transformer/convolution-based detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more efficient radar detection system that reduces computational complexity and parameter count while maintaining competitive performance compared to existing transformer and convolution-based approaches.

Method: Uses two sequential State Space Models: one processes samples from all receiver channels within one chirp to learn chirp-wise features, and another processes chirp-wise features to learn frame representations. The latent representations are then decoded for segmentation and detection tasks.

Result: SSMRadNet achieves 10-33x fewer parameters, 60-88x less computation (GFLOPs), and is 3.7x faster than state-of-the-art transformer and convolution-based radar detectors while maintaining competitive performance for segmentation tasks on the RADIal dataset.

Conclusion: SSMRadNet demonstrates that State Space Models can provide highly efficient alternatives to transformers and convolutions for radar processing, offering significant reductions in computational requirements and inference speed while maintaining competitive detection performance.

Abstract: We introduce SSMRadNet, the first multi-scale State Space Model (SSM) based detector for Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar that sequentially processes raw ADC samples through two SSMs. One SSM learns a chirp-wise feature by sequentially processing samples from all receiver channels within one chirp, and a second SSM learns a representation of a frame by sequentially processing chirp-wise features. The latent representations of a radar frame are decoded to perform segmentation and detection tasks.

Motivation: To enable simultaneous communication with mobile users and environmental monitoring using the same time-frequency resources in cell-free massive MIMO systems, addressing the need for efficient integrated sensing and communications.

Method: Combines user-centric architecture for data services with target-centric approach for detection tasks, derives receive sensing SNR under generalized likelihood ratio test, and formulates QoS scheme to maximize achievable data rate and effective sensing SNR.

Result: The proposed power control design outperforms orthogonal resource allocation algorithms, demonstrating superior performance in ISAC-enabled cell-free massive MIMO networks.

Conclusion: The integration of user-centric and target-centric approaches in CF-mMIMO systems enables effective simultaneous communication and sensing, showing significant potential for ISAC networks compared to traditional orthogonal resource methods.

Abstract: This paper addresses the power control design for a cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) system that performs integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). Specifically, the case where many access points are deployed to simultaneously communicate with mobile users and monitor the surrounding environment at the same time-frequency slot is considered. On top of the user-centric architecture used for the data services, a target-centric approach is introduced for the detection tasks. As a valuable performance metric, we derive the receive sensing signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio under generalized likelihood ratio test processing. Based on that, we formulate a quality-of-service (QoS) scheme that maximizes the two figures of merit: achievable data rate and effective sensing SNR. Simulations demonstrate that our proposal surpasses orthogonal resource algorithms, underscoring the potential of ISAC-enabled CF-mMIMO networks.

*Anshu Arora,Kaluguri Yashaswini,Satish Mulleti*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A linear-bias IF-TEM (LB-IF-TEM) is proposed to reduce oversampling in time encoding machines by dynamically tracking the input signal, enabling efficient non-uniform quantization with lower bitrate while maintaining reconstruction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional IF-TEMs exhibit excessive oversampling, leading to inefficient encoding for signals with smoothly distributed information, which motivates the development of a more efficient time-based encoding framework.

Method: The LB-IF-TEM uses a linear bias that dynamically tracks the input signal to maintain a nearly constant integrator input, localizing firing intervals and enabling effective non-uniform quantization.

Result: Experimental results show comparable reconstruction accuracy at significantly lower bitrate than existing IF-TEM variants, with theoretical bounds established on the achievable oversampling range.

Conclusion: The LB-IF-TEM provides a low-power, communication-efficient, and analytically tractable framework for time-based signal encoding and reconstruction with reduced oversampling.

Abstract: Integrate-and-fire time encoding machines (IF-TEMs) provide an efficient framework for asynchronous sampling of bandlimited signals through discrete firing times. However, conventional IF-TEMs often exhibit excessive oversampling, leading to inefficient encoding for signals with smoothly distributed information. This letter introduces a linear-bias IF-TEM (LB-IF-TEM), where the bias dynamically tracks the input signal to maintain a nearly constant integrator input, thereby localizing the firing intervals. The resulting concentrated distribution enables effective non-uniform quantization with reduced distortion. Theoretical analysis establishes explicit bounds on the achievable oversampling range, while experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method attains comparable reconstruction accuracy at significantly lower bitrate than existing IF-TEM variants. The LB-IF-TEM thus provides a low-power, communication-efficient, and analytically tractable framework for time-based signal encoding and reconstruction.

TL;DR: RadHARSimulator V2 is a simulator that generates Doppler spectra from video footage for radar-based human activity recognition, using computer vision for pose estimation and radar simulation modules to create realistic radar data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing radar-based HAR simulation methods lack flexibility as they rely on models or motion-captured data, creating a need for a more comprehensive simulation approach.

Method: The simulator uses computer vision for human detection, 2D/3D pose estimation with Kalman filtering, and radar simulation with pose interpolation, echo simulation, range-time/Doppler-time map generation, and feature extraction using maximum local energy method.

Result: Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of both the simulator and the proposed hybrid parallel-serial neural network architecture for radar-based HAR.

Conclusion: The RadHARSimulator V2 provides a flexible and comprehensive solution for generating Doppler spectra from video footage, advancing radar-based human activity recognition with open-source availability.

Abstract: Radar-based human activity recognition (HAR) still lacks a comprehensive simulation method. Existing software is developed based on models or motion-captured data, resulting in limited flexibility. To address this issue, a simulator that directly generates Doppler spectra from recorded video footage (RadHARSimulator V2) is presented in this paper. Both computer vision and radar modules are included in the simulator. In computer vision module, the real-time model for object detection with global nearest neighbor is first used to detect and track human targets in the video. Then, the high-resolution network is used to estimate two-dimensional poses of the detected human targets. Next, the three-dimensional poses of the detected human targets are obtained by nearest matching method. Finally, smooth temporal three-dimensional pose estimation is achieved through Kalman filtering. In radar module, pose interpolation and smoothing are first achieved through the Savitzky-Golay method. Second, the delay model and the mirror method are used to simulate echoes in both free-space and through-the-wall scenarios. Then, range-time map is generated using pulse compression, moving target indication, and DnCNN. Next, Doppler-time map (DTM) is generated using short-time Fourier transform and DnCNN again. Finally, the ridge features on the DTM are extracted using the maximum local energy method. In addition, a hybrid parallel-serial neural network architecture is proposed for radar-based HAR. Numerical experiments are conducted and analyzed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed simulator and the proposed network model.

*Itsuki Yazawa,Akira Furui*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A novel method using variational autoencoder with mixconsistency loss to synthesize combined EMG motion patterns in structured latent space, improving classification accuracy by ~30% over traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods assume combined motions are linear combinations of basic motions, but this fails due to complex neuromuscular phenomena like muscle co-contraction, leading to low-fidelity synthetic signals and poor classification performance.

Method: Uses VAE to encode EMG signals into low-dimensional latent space, introduces mixconsistency loss to structure the space so combined motions are embedded between constituent basic motions, then generates synthetic patterns in this structured space for classifier training.

Result: Validated with eight healthy participants in upper-limb motion classification experiments, achieving approximately 30% improvement in accuracy compared to input-space synthesis approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed latent space synthesis method effectively addresses limitations of linear combination assumptions and significantly improves combined motion recognition performance in EMG-based classification.

Abstract: Electromyogram (EMG)-based motion classification using machine learning has been widely employed in applications such as prosthesis control. While previous studies have explored generating synthetic patterns of combined motions to reduce training data requirements, these methods assume that combined motions can be represented as linear combinations of basic motions. However, this assumption often fails due to complex neuromuscular phenomena such as muscle co-contraction, resulting in low-fidelity synthetic signals and degraded classification performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel method that learns to synthesize combined motion patterns in a structured latent space. Specifically, we employ a variational autoencoder (VAE) to encode EMG signals into a low-dimensional representation and introduce a mixconsistency loss that structures the latent space such that combined motions are embedded between their constituent basic motions. Synthetic patterns are then generated within this structured latent space and used to train classifiers for recognizing unseen combined motions. We validated our approach through upper-limb motion classification experiments with eight healthy participants. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms input-space synthesis approaches, achieving approximately 30% improvement in accuracy.

*Georgios Kokkinis,Alexandros Iosifidis,Qi Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Proposes xHAP, a deep learning architecture using cross-modal attention to estimate haptic feedback for Tactile Internet, achieving significant improvements in accuracy and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tactile Internet requires ultra-low latency haptic feedback, but reliable transmission is challenging due to channel variations and network outages. Local estimation can help but existing methods lack accuracy.

Method: xHAP uses cross-modal attention to fuse historical force feedback and operator control actions. It employs modality-specific encoders and cross-attention layers to selectively focus on relevant sensory data.

Result: Reduces mean-squared error by >100x, lowers SNR requirement by 10dB, increases coverage by 138%, and supports 59.6% more users even at 10dB lower SNR compared to baseline.

Conclusion: xHAP provides a highly effective solution for reliable haptic feedback estimation in Tactile Internet applications, significantly outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: The Tactile Internet requires ultra-low latency and high-fidelity haptic feedback to enable immersive teleoperation. A key challenge is to ensure ultra-reliable and low-latency transmission of haptic packets under channel variations and potential network outages. To address these issues, one approach relies on local estimation of haptic feedback at the operator side. However, designing an accurate estimator that can faithfully reproduce the true haptic forces remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning architecture, xHAP, based on cross-modal attention to estimate haptic feedback. xHAP fuses information from two distinct data streams: the teleoperator's historical force feedback and the operator's control action sequence. We employ modality-specific encoders to learn temporal representations, followed by a cross-attention layer where the teleoperator haptic data attend to the operator input. This fusion allows the model to selectively focus on the most relevant operator sensory data when predicting the teleoperator's haptic feedback. The proposed architecture reduces the mean-squared error by more than two orders of magnitude compared to existing methods and lowers the SNR requirement for reliable transmission by $10~\mathrm{dB}$ at an error threshold of $0.1$ in a 3GPP UMa scenario. Additionally, it increases coverage by $138\%$ and supports $59.6\%$ more haptic users even under 10 dB lower SNR compared to the baseline.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legacy time-frequency modulations perform poorly in doubly-selective channels with large delay and Doppler spreads, requiring new modulation designs.

Method: Developed analytical framework using two characteristics: non-selectivity (relates to diversity) and predictability (relates to spectral efficiency).

Result: Delay-Doppler, chirp, and time-sequency domain modulations are non-selective, predictable, and equivalent; time-frequency modulations are selective and non-predictable.

Conclusion: New modulation schemes in delay-Doppler, chirp, and time-sequency domains offer better performance than traditional time-frequency modulations for doubly-selective channels.

Abstract: There is significant recent interest in designing new modulation schemes for doubly-selective channels with large delay and Doppler spreads, where legacy modulation schemes based on time-frequency signal representations do not perform well. In this paper, we develop a framework for analyzing such modulations using two characteristics -- non-selectivity and predictability -- which directly relate to the diversity and spectral efficiency that the modulations achieve. We show that modulations in the delay-Doppler, chirp and time-sequency domains are non-selective, predictable and equivalent to one another, whereas time-frequency modulations are selective and non-predictable.

TL;DR: This paper develops optimal pilot pattern design for OFDM systems in doubly dispersive channels using LMMSE estimation, deriving a closed-form lower bound and lattice-based patterns that achieve this bound.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of optimal pilot pattern design for channel estimation in OFDM systems operating in doubly dispersive channels, where traditional methods lack analytical tractability.

Method: Decomposed channel covariance matrix into Kronecker product of delay and Doppler domain matrices, applied Szegö limit theorem for DFT-based diagonalization, reformulated LMMSE error into analytical form, and derived lattice-based pilot patterns.

Result: Developed a closed-form lower bound for LMMSE channel estimation error and established conditions for achieving this bound with lattice-based pilot patterns, with numerical verification showing negligible approximation error.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides analytically tractable optimal pilot pattern design for OFDM systems in doubly dispersive channels, with lattice-based patterns achieving the derived performance bound.

Abstract: This paper investigates the optimal pilot pattern design, in the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimator sense, for OFDM systems in doubly dispersive channels. To enable analytical tractability, the channel covariance matrix is decomposed into the Kronecker product of two Hermitian Toeplitz matrices corresponding to the delay and Doppler domains. By invoking the Szegö limit theorem, these matrices are shown to be approximately diagonalizable by discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrices. Based on this structure, the LMMSE channel estimation error is reformulated into a compact analytical form, from which a closed-form lower bound is derived. Furthermore, we establish the condition under which this bound is achieved by a lattice-based pilot pattern. Numerical results verify that the proposed matrix approximation introduces negligible error and examples of the proposed lattice design are given.

Motivation: Existing wireless radiance field methods for channel prediction suffer from limited robustness, slow convergence, and modest accuracy in complex environments due to insufficiently refined modeling.

Method: Uses ray-based pipeline with coarse-to-fine importance sampling, conical-frustum sampling, scale-consistent hybrid positional encoding, shared MLP processing, and curriculum learning. Combines MLP outputs with modeled pathloss and surface interaction attenuation for physical fidelity.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with 14.3 dB reduction in normalized mean square error (NMSE) in typical scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed Mip-NeWRF framework effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by incorporating physics-informed modeling and advanced encoding techniques, achieving superior channel prediction accuracy and convergence performance.

Abstract: Recent work on wireless radiance fields represents a promising deep learning approach for channel prediction, however, in complex environments these methods still exhibit limited robustness, slow convergence, and modest accuracy due to insufficiently refined modeling. To address this issue, we propose Mip-NeWRF, a physics-informed neural framework for accurate indoor channel prediction based on sparse channel measurements. The framework operates in a ray-based pipeline with coarse-to-fine importance sampling: frustum samples are encoded, processed by a shared multilayer perceptron (MLP), and the outputs are synthesized into the channel frequency response (CFR). Prior to MLP input, Mip-NeWRF performs conical-frustum sampling and applies a scale-consistent hybrid positional encoding to each frustum. The scale-consistent normalization aligns positional encodings across scene scales, while the hybrid encoding supplies both scale-robust, low-frequency stability to accelerate convergence and fine spatial detail to improve accuracy. During training, a curriculum learning schedule is applied to stabilize and accelerate convergence of the shared MLP. During channel synthesis, the MLP outputs, including predicted virtual transmitter presence probabilities and amplitudes, are combined with modeled pathloss and surface interaction attenuation to enhance physical fidelity and further improve accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach: in typical scenarios, the normalized mean square error (NMSE) is reduced by 14.3 dB versus state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The study provides a comprehensive framework for understanding and designing ISAC systems in doubly dispersive channels, highlighting the trade-offs between different interference modeling approaches for optimal sensing and communication performance.

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic analysis of inter-symbol and inter-carrier interference (ISCI) modeling in doubly dispersive channels for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. We propose a generalized OFDM (Weyl-Heisenberg) framework to evaluate four ISCI treatment approaches: (1) explicit estimation and compensation, (2) complete ignorance, (3) uncorrelated colored noise approximation, and (4) correlated colored noise modeling. Through continuous delay-Doppler channel characterization, we derive LMMSE channel estimators and corresponding estimation errors (as sensing metrics) for both pilot-assisted and fully-known symbol scenarios. The communication performance is quantified via ergodic capacity bounds under imperfect CSI. Our theoretical analysis and numerical results reveal fundamental performance-complexity trade-offs, providing insights for practical ISAC waveform and receiver design in doubly dispersive channels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional DAS beamforming has poor quality (high sidelobes, wide main lobe, low contrast) while adaptive methods are computationally expensive and impractical for real-time operation with single-snapshot constraints.

Method: Higher-order non-linear beamforming using Delay-Multiply-and-Sum technique coupled with Coherence Factor weighting, specifically adapted for ultrasonic in-air microphone arrays with GPU-accelerated real-time implementation.

Result: Significant improvements in image contrast compared to DAS baseline, validated through both simulated and real-world acoustic data.

Conclusion: Higher-order non-linear beamforming is established as a practical, high-performance solution for in-air acoustic imaging that overcomes the trade-off between quality and computational cost.

Abstract: In-air acoustic imaging systems demand beamforming techniques that offer a high dynamic range and spatial resolution while also remaining robust. Conventional Delay-and-Sum (DAS) beamforming fails to meet these quality demands due to high sidelobes, a wide main lobe and the resulting low contrast, whereas advanced adaptive methods are typically precluded by the computational cost and the single-snapshot constraint of real-time field operation. To overcome this trade-off, we propose and detail the implementation of higher-order non-linear beamforming methods using the Delay-Multiply-and-Sum technique, coupled with Coherence Factor weighting, specifically adapted for ultrasonic in-air microphone arrays. Our efficient implementation allows for enabling GPU-accelerated, real-time performance on embedded computing platforms. Through validation against the DAS baseline using simulated and real-world acoustic data, we demonstrate that the proposed method provides significant improvements in image contrast, establishing higher-order non-linear beamforming as a practical, high-performance solution for in-air acoustic imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing line-shaped PASS architectures have limited spatial flexibility that constrains their applicability in multiuser and indoor scenarios, requiring extension to 2D configurations for better coverage.

Method: Developed an optimization framework to maximize minimum SNR by adaptively adjusting pinching antenna spatial configurations, with PSO-based algorithms for continuous positions and discrete variants for practical hardware constraints.

Result: Simulation results show 2D-PASS substantially improves minimum SNR compared to line-shaped PASS and fixed-position antenna benchmarks, maintaining robustness under varying user distributions and distances.

Conclusion: The proposed 2D-PASS architecture successfully extends the conventional line-shaped structure into a reconfigurable radiating plane, enabling dynamic beam adaptation across 2D spatial domains for improved multiuser performance.

Abstract: Recently, the pinching-antenna system (PASS) has emerged as a promising architecture owing to its ability to reconfigure large-scale path loss and signal phase by activating radiation points along a dielectric waveguide. However, existing studies mainly focus on line-shaped PASS architectures, whose limited spatial flexibility constrains their applicability in multiuser and indoor scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel two-dimensional (2D) pinching-antenna system (2D-PASS) that extends the conventional line-shaped structure into a continuous dielectric waveguide plane, thereby forming a reconfigurable radiating plane capable of dynamic beam adaptation across a 2D spatial domain. An optimization framework is developed to maximize the minimum received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) among user equipments (UEs) by adaptively adjusting the spatial configuration of pinching antennas (PAs), serving as an analog beamforming mechanism for dynamic spatial control. For the continuous-position scenario, a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based algorithm is proposed to efficiently explore the nonconvex search space, while a discrete variant is introduced to accommodate practical hardware constraints with limited PA placement resolution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed 2D-PASS substantially improves the minimum SNR compared with conventional line-shaped PASS and fixed-position antenna (FPA) benchmarks, while maintaining robustness under varying user distributions and distances.

TL;DR: Proposes a digital twin-aided channel charting method to produce positioning in true spatial coordinates by matching large-scale CSI features using cosine similarity, reducing positioning error by 29% without labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Channel charting provides self-supervised positioning but produces coordinates in arbitrary systems not aligned with true spatial coordinates, limiting practical applications.

Method: Combines digital twin CSI features with estimated CSI using cosine-similarity loss, integrated with conventional channel charting loss to learn positioning function without labeled data.

Result: Reduces relative mean distance error by 29% compared to state-of-the-art in simulated indoor scenario, shows robustness to DT modeling mismatches and distribution shifts.

Conclusion: Digital twin-aided channel charting successfully produces true spatial coordinates with improved accuracy and robustness, enabling practical positioning applications.

Abstract: Channel charting (CC) is a self-supervised positioning technique whose main limitation is that the estimated positions lie in an arbitrary coordinate system that is not aligned with true spatial coordinates. In this work, we propose a novel method to produce CC locations in true spatial coordinates with the aid of a digital twin (DT). Our main contribution is a new framework that (i) extracts large-scale channel-state information (CSI) features from estimated CSI and the DT and (ii) matches these features with a cosine-similarity loss function. The DT-aided loss function is then combined with a conventional CC loss to learn a positioning function that provides true spatial coordinates without relying on labeled data. Our results for a simulated indoor scenario demonstrate that the proposed framework reduces the relative mean distance error by 29% compared to the state of the art. We also show that the proposed approach is robust to DT modeling mismatches and a distribution shift in the testing data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing detectors that primarily focus on phase distortions or use Euclidean distance, by developing a unified framework that handles both amplitude and phase impairments in realistic transceiver hardware.

Method: Proposes the approximate phase-and-amplitude distortion detector (PAD-D) operating in polar domain with distortion-aware weighting, and derives closed-form high-SNR symbol error probability approximation for arbitrary constellations.

Result: PAD-D achieves up to an order-of-magnitude reduction in error floor compared to EUC-D and GAP-D for high-order QAM and SAPSK constellations, and enables development of optimized constellations that further minimize SEP.

Conclusion: The framework provides a unified and practical solution for reliable detection under realistic transceiver impairments, with verified accuracy through simulations and analytical approximations.

Abstract: This paper presents a maximum-likelihood detection framework that jointly mitigates hardware (HW) impairments in both amplitude and phase. By modeling transceiver distortions as residual amplitude and phase noise, we introduce the approximate phase-and-amplitude distortion detector (PAD-D), which operates in the polar domain and effectively mitigates both distortion components through distortion-aware weighting. The proposed detector performs reliable detection under generalized HW impairment conditions, achieving substantial performance gains over the conventional Euclidean detector (EUC-D) and the Gaussian-assumption phase noise detector (GAP-D), which is primarily designed to address phase distortions. In addition, we derive a closed-form high-SNR symbol error probability (SEP) approximation, which offers a generic analytical expression applicable to arbitrary constellations. Simulation results demonstrate that the PAD-D achieves up to an order-of-magnitude reduction in the error floor relative to EUC-D and GAP-D for both high-order quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and super amplitude phase-shift keying (SAPSK) constellations, establishing a unified and practical framework for detection under realistic transceiver impairments. Building on this framework, we further develop optimized constellations tailored to PAD-D, where the symbol positions are optimized in the complex plane to minimize SEP. The optimality of these constellations is confirmed through extensive simulations, which also verify the accuracy of the proposed analytical SEP approximation, even for the optimized designs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a bistatic sensing system capable of realizing extremely-large MIMO apertures using metasurface antenna arrays, addressing mutual coupling effects and optimizing sensing performance.

Method: Proposed coupled-dipole model capturing mutual coupling from waveguide and free-space interactions, introduced passivity constraint on magnetic polarizabilities, used Neumann-series approximation for array response, derived Cramer-Rao bound for multi-target estimation, and optimized metasurface element resonance configuration.

Result: Simulation results quantify position error bounds in radiative near field, demonstrating critical importance of metamaterial placement in strongly coupled metasurface-based XL MIMO bistatic sensing systems.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables physics-consistent bistatic sensing with XL MIMO metasurface arrays, with metamaterial placement playing a crucial role in system performance optimization.

Abstract: This paper presents a physics-consistent framework for bistatic sensing incorporating a 2-Dimensional (2D) waveguide-fed metasurface antenna array capable of realizing eXtremely-Large Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (XL MIMO) apertures. A coupled-dipole model is presented that captures the array's mutual coupling due to both waveguide and free-space interactions, and a novel passivity constraint on the corresponding magnetic polarizabilities is proposed. Focusing on a bistatic sensing setup, we leverage a Neumann-series approximation of the array response model and derive the Cramer-Rao bound for multi-target parameter estimation, which is then incorporated into a sensing optimization formulation with respect to the metasurface's per-element resonance strength configuration. Simulation results on the position error bound in the radiative near field with the proposed design quantify the critical role of metamaterial placement in strongly coupled metasurface-based XL MIMO bistatic sensing systems.

TL;DR: Developed a complete analytical model for optimizing photoacoustic imaging system sensitivity using the KLM model, addressing end-to-end coupling between transducer, cable, and receiver components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies focused only on front-end acoustic or back-end electronic components separately, overlooking the critical end-to-end coupling effects that affect system sensitivity and image quality in photoacoustic imaging.

Method: Rederived KLM model from first principles, encapsulated acoustic components into controlled voltage source, extended model to include lumped-parameter representations of cable and receiver, and established end-to-end equivalent circuit to derive analytical transfer functions.

Result: Experimental validation showed average error below 5%, identified low-frequency tailing phenomenon from exceeding 1D vibration assumption, and revealed coupling effects among key parameters (element area, cable length, receiver impedance).

Conclusion: Provides a comprehensive framework for optimizing detection sensitivity and improving image fidelity in PAI systems, with insights into model limitations and potential artifact suppression pathways.

Abstract: The sensitivity of the acoustic detection subsystem in photoacoustic imaging (PAI) critically affects image quality. However, previous studies often focused only on front-end acoustic components or back-end electronic components, overlooking end-to-end coupling among the transducer, cable, and receiver. This work develops a complete analytical model for system-level sensitivity optimization based on the Krimholtz, Leedom, and Matthaei (KLM) model. The KLM model is rederived from first principles of linear piezoelectric constitutive equations, 1D wave equations and transmission line theory to clarify its physical basis and applicable conditions. By encapsulating the acoustic components into a controlled voltage source and extending the model to include lumped-parameter representations of cable and receiver, an end-to-end equivalent circuit is established. Analytical expressions for the system transfer functions are derived, revealing the coupling effects among key parameters such as transducer element area (EA), cable length (CL), and receiver impedance (RI). Experimental results validate the model with an average error below 5%. Additionally, a low-frequency tailing phenomenon arising from exceeding the 1D vibration assumption is identified and analyzed, illustrating the importance of understanding the model's applicable conditions and providing a potential pathway for artifact suppression. This work offers a comprehensive framework for optimizing detection sensitivity and improving image fidelity in PAI systems.

TL;DR: Enhanced DAS framework using STFT for temporal-frequency analysis and video-to-DAS cross-modal pre-training to overcome data limitations and improve performance in distributed acoustic sensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous DAS-MAE method had limitations in frequency analysis for temporal-dominated data and insufficient training data for Transformer architectures, requiring improved feature extraction and data augmentation approaches.

Method: Incorporates short-time Fourier transform (STFT) for explicit temporal-frequency feature extraction and introduces video-to-DAS cross-modal pre-training to expand training resources and mitigate data constraints through label-free reconstruction tasks.

Result: Achieved 0.1% error rate in few-shot classification (90.9% relative improvement over DAS-MAE) and 4.7% recognition error in external damage prevention (75.4% improvement over from-scratch training).

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges computer vision and distributed sensing, enabling enhanced DAS deployment across industrial scenarios while advancing cross-modal representation learning for industrial IoT sensing.

Abstract: Fiber-optic distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) has emerged as a critical Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensing technology with broad industrial applications. However, the two-dimensional spatial-temporal morphology of DAS signals presents analytical challenges where conventional methods prove suboptimal, while being well-suited for deep learning approaches. Although our previous work, DAS Masked Autoencoder (DAS-MAE), established state-of-the-art performance and generalization without labels, it is not satisfactory in frequency analysis in temporal-dominated DAS data. Moreover, the limitation of effective training data fails to address the substantial data requirements inherent to Transformer architectures in DAS-MAE. To overcome these limitations, we present an enhanced framework incorporating short-time Fourier transform (STFT) for explicit temporal-frequency feature extraction and pioneering video-to-DAS cross-modal pre-training to mitigate data constraints. This approach learns high-level representations (e.g., event classification) through label-free reconstruction tasks. Experimental results demonstrate transformative improvements: 0.1% error rate in few-shot classification (90.9% relative improvement over DAS-MAE) and 4.7% recognition error in external damage prevention applications (75.4% improvement over from-scratch training). As the first work to pioneer video-to-DAS cross-modal pre-training, available training resources are expanded by bridging computer vision and distributed sensing areas. The enhanced performance and generalization facilitate DAS deployment across diverse industrial scenarios while advancing cross-modal representation learning for industrial IoT sensing.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reduced-complexity Multiple-Model Coding approach for electrical signal waveforms that jointly optimizes parametric models and rate allocation to achieve target distortion constraints while reducing computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve compression efficiency for electrical signal waveforms while satisfying reconstructed signal quality constraints, addressing the limitations of baseline MMC approaches that produce constant-rate bitstreams with varying quality.

Method: Three approaches: 1) exhaustive search as baseline, 2) Golden Section search for first-stage rate determination with reduced complexity, 3) rate-distortion modeling to identify promising models and reduced search intervals for rate selection in both stages.

Result: The proposed reduced-complexity MMC approach achieves lower rates for given distortion constraints compared to state-of-the-art solutions for Voltage and Current Signal compression with equivalent complexity.

Conclusion: The joint optimization of parametric models and rate allocation in MMC framework successfully reduces complexity while maintaining compression efficiency for electrical signal waveforms.

Abstract: This paper adapts a Multiple-Model Coding (MMC) approach for sampled electrical signal waveforms to satisfy reconstructed signal quality constraints. The baseline MMC approach consists of two stages processing vectors of Voltage and Current Signal (VCS) of constant size and producing bitstreams of constant rate but varying quality. In the proposed approach, the parametric model and the rate allocated to the first stage, as well as the residual compression method of the second stage and its associated rate, are jointly optimized to achieve a target distortion of the reconstructed signal. Three approaches are proposed. An exhaustive search serves as a baseline for comparison. Then, an approach involving a Golden Section search is exploited to determine the rate of the first stage with reduced complexity. Finally, rate-distortion models of the compression efficiency for each model in the first stage are employed to obtain a subset of promising models in the first stage and reduced-size search intervals for the rate selection in both stages. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed reduced-complexity MMC approach reduces the rate for a given distortion constraint compared to state-of-the-art solutions for VCS with equivalent complexity.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable intelligent beam training with reduced overheads by leveraging LLMs for context-aware and environment-adaptive probing in pinching antenna systems.

Method: Developed LLM-based beam training supervised learning mechanism using pretrained GPTs trained end-to-end with cross-entropy loss. For single-user: formulated beamforming codebook generation problem with MRT. For multi-user: formulated joint codebook generation and beam selection problem with MMSE transmit beamforming.

Result: Single-user: achieved over 95% Top-1 accuracy in beam selection and 51.92% improvement in beamforming gains. Multi-user: achieved up to 57.14% and 33.33% improvements in sum rate compared to LLM-based massive MIMO and conventional PASS beam training respectively.

Conclusion: The LLM-enabled PASS framework effectively reduces beam training overhead while significantly improving system performance in both single-user and multi-user MIMO communications.

Abstract: To enable intelligent beam training, a large language model (LLM)-enabled beam training framework is proposed for the pinching antenna system (PASS) in downlink multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications. A novel LLM-based beam training supervised learning mechanism is developed, allowing context-aware and environment-adaptive probing for PASS to reduce overheads. Both single-user and multi-user cases are considered. 1) For single-user case, the LLM-based pinching beamforming codebook generation problem is formulated to maximize the beamforming gain. Then, the optimal transmit beamforming is obtained by maximum ratio transmission (MRT). 2) For multi-user case, a joint codebook generation and beam selection problem is formulated based on the system sum rate under the minimum mean square error (MMSE) transmit beamforming. The training labels for pinching beamforming are constructed by selecting the beam combination that maximizes system performance from each user's Top-S candidate beams. Based on pretrained Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs), the LLM is trained in an end-to-end fashion to minimize the cross-entropy loss. Simulation results demonstrate that: i) For single-user case, the proposed LLM-enabled PASS attains over 95% Top-1 accuracy in beam selection and achieves 51.92% improvements in beamforming gains compared to conventional method. ii) For multi-user case, the proposed LLM-enabled PASS framework significantly outperforms both the LLM-based massive MIMO and conventional PASS beam training, achieving up to 57.14% and 33.33% improvements in sum rate, respectively.

Motivation: To investigate the performance of fluid antenna systems with multiple port activation and maximum ratio combining over Rician fading channels, addressing the need for analytical frameworks for such advanced antenna systems.

Method: Used Laplace transform-based approach to derive statistics of post-combining SNR, developed closed-form expressions for outage probability lower bound and asymptotic analysis at high SNR, validated with numerical results.

Result: Successfully derived analytical expressions for outage probability statistics, validated numerical results show interplay of key system parameters on MRC-based FAS performance.

Conclusion: The proposed analytical framework effectively characterizes the performance of MRC-based fluid antenna systems and provides insights into parameter optimization for improved system performance.

Abstract: This paper investigates a fluid antenna system (FAS) where a single-antenna transmitter communicates with a receiver equipped with a fluid antenna (FA) over a Rician fading channel. Considering that multiple ports among the M available FA ports can be activated, the receiver selects the best K with the highest instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and combines the received signals at the selected ports using maximum ratio combining. The statistics of the post-combining SNR are derived using a Laplace transform-based approach, which allows to analyze the outage probability (OP) of the FAS. Additional closed-form expressions for a lower bound on the OP and the asymptotic OP at high SNR are presented. Numerical results validate the analytical framework and demonstrate the interplay of key system parameters on the performance of the considered MRC-based FAS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training recursive reasoning models is computationally expensive (36 GPU-hours per dataset), limiting broader adoption and research.

Method: CGAR uses Progressive Depth Curriculum (dynamic recursion depth adjustment) and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting (exponentially decaying supervision importance) to train models more efficiently.

Result: Achieved 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop on Sudoku-Extreme dataset. Models show 100% halting accuracy and 11% fewer reasoning steps.

Conclusion: Principled curriculum on architectural depth enables efficient training of recursive reasoning models on modest hardware, demonstrating Pareto improvement in efficiency and solution quality.

Abstract: Recursive reasoning models achieve remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks through iterative refinement, enabling tiny networks to match large language models thousands of times their size. However, training remains computationally expensive, prior work reporting approximately 36 GPU-hours per dataset, limiting broader adoption and research. We propose CGAR, a novel training methodology that applies curriculum learning to architectural depth rather than traditional data ordering. CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%). Systematic ablations reveal Progressive Depth Curriculum alone achieves 2.26x speedup with 85.47% accuracy, demonstrating a rare Pareto improvement where architectural curriculum simultaneously enhances training efficiency and solution quality. CGAR-trained models exhibit superior inference efficiency with 100% halting accuracy and 11% fewer reasoning steps. Our work demonstrates that principled curriculum on architectural depth enables efficient training of recursive reasoning models on modest hardware.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MoM is constrained by static, geometry-defined basis functions like RWG, limiting adaptability and learnability in electromagnetic modeling.

Method: Proposes PhyKAN - a physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network that generalizes RWG into learnable adaptive basis, integrating local KAN branch with global branch embedded with Green's function priors from EFIE.

Result: Achieves sub-0.01 reconstruction errors across canonical geometries and accurate unsupervised radar cross section predictions.

Conclusion: PhyKAN offers an interpretable, physics-consistent bridge between classical solvers and modern neural networks for electromagnetic modeling.

Abstract: The Method of Moments (MoM) is constrained by the usage of static, geometry-defined basis functions, such as the Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) basis. This letter reframes electromagnetic modeling around a learnable basis representation rather than solving for the coefficients over a fixed basis. We first show that the RWG basis is essentially a static and piecewise-linear realization of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Inspired by this insight, we propose PhyKAN, a physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) that generalizes RWG into a learnable and adaptive basis family. Derived from the EFIE, PhyKAN integrates a local KAN branch with a global branch embedded with Green's function priors to preserve physical consistency. It is demonstrated that, across canonical geometries, PhyKAN achieves sub-0.01 reconstruction errors as well as accurate, unsupervised radar cross section predictions, offering an interpretable, physics-consistent bridge between classical solvers and modern neural network models for electromagnetic modeling.

This report introduces TabPFN-2.5, the next generation of our tabular foundation model, built for datasets with up to 50,000 data points and 2,000 features, a 20x increase in data cells compared to TabPFNv2. TabPFN-2.5 is now the leading method for the industry standard benchmark TabArena (which contains datasets with up to 100,000 training data points), substantially outperforming tuned tree-based models and matching the accuracy of AutoGluon 1.4, a complex four-hour tuned ensemble that even includes the previous TabPFNv2. Remarkably, default TabPFN-2.5 has a 100% win rate against default XGBoost on small to medium-sized classification datasets (<=10,000 data points, 500 features) and a 87% win rate on larger datasets up to 100K samples and 2K features (85% for regression). For production use cases, we introduce a new distillation engine that converts TabPFN-2.5 into a compact MLP or tree ensemble, preserving most of its accuracy while delivering orders-of-magnitude lower latency and plug-and-play deployment. This new release will immediately strengthen the performance of the many applications and methods already built on the TabPFN ecosystem.

Motivation: Traditional numerical PDE solvers are computationally expensive, while data-driven methods suffer from error accumulation and limited physical consistency, especially in multiphysics and complex geometries.

Method: Proposes PEGNet with PDE-guided message passing that embeds key PDE dynamics (convection, viscosity, diffusion) into distinct message functions, uses hierarchical architecture for multi-scale features, and integrates physical regularization into the loss function.

Result: Significant improvements in long-term prediction accuracy and physical consistency over existing methods on benchmarks including custom datasets for respiratory airflow and drug delivery.

Conclusion: PEGNet successfully integrates physical constraints into neural network architecture, producing more stable and physically consistent solutions for PDE-based simulations.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulations of physical phenomena governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) are important for scientific and engineering progress. While traditional numerical solvers are powerful, they are often computationally expensive. Recently, data-driven methods have emerged as alternatives, but they frequently suffer from error accumulation and limited physical consistency, especially in multiphysics and complex geometries. To address these challenges, we propose PEGNet, a Physics-Embedded Graph Network that incorporates PDE-guided message passing to redesign the graph neural network architecture. By embedding key PDE dynamics like convection, viscosity, and diffusion into distinct message functions, the model naturally integrates physical constraints into its forward propagation, producing more stable and physically consistent solutions. Additionally, a hierarchical architecture is employed to capture multi-scale features, and physical regularization is integrated into the loss function to further enforce adherence to governing physics. We evaluated PEGNet on benchmarks, including custom datasets for respiratory airflow and drug delivery, showing significant improvements in long-term prediction accuracy and physical consistency over existing methods.

TL;DR: FAIRPLAI is a framework that integrates human oversight into ML systems to balance accuracy, privacy, and fairness through privacy-fairness frontiers, stakeholder input, and private auditing loops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ML systems struggle to simultaneously achieve accuracy, fairness, and privacy - privacy measures can worsen disparities, fairness interventions need sensitive data, and automated approaches ignore human contextual judgment.

Method: FAIRPLAI works through three mechanisms: (1) privacy-fairness frontiers showing trade-offs transparently, (2) interactive stakeholder input for selecting fairness criteria, and (3) differentially private auditing loops for human review without compromising data security.

Result: Applied to benchmark datasets, FAIRPLAI preserves strong privacy protections while reducing fairness disparities compared to automated baselines, providing interpretable process for practitioners.

Conclusion: By embedding human judgment where it matters most, FAIRPLAI offers a pathway to ML systems that are effective, responsible, and trustworthy in practice.

Abstract: As machine learning systems move from theory to practice, they are increasingly tasked with decisions that affect healthcare access, financial opportunities, hiring, and public services. In these contexts, accuracy is only one piece of the puzzle - models must also be fair to different groups, protect individual privacy, and remain accountable to stakeholders. Achieving all three is difficult: differential privacy can unintentionally worsen disparities, fairness interventions often rely on sensitive data that privacy restricts, and automated pipelines ignore that fairness is ultimately a human and contextual judgment. We introduce FAIRPLAI (Fair and Private Learning with Active Human Influence), a practical framework that integrates human oversight into the design and deployment of machine learning systems. FAIRPLAI works in three ways: (1) it constructs privacy-fairness frontiers that make trade-offs between accuracy, privacy guarantees, and group outcomes transparent; (2) it enables interactive stakeholder input, allowing decision-makers to select fairness criteria and operating points that reflect their domain needs; and (3) it embeds a differentially private auditing loop, giving humans the ability to review explanations and edge cases without compromising individual data security. Applied to benchmark datasets, FAIRPLAI consistently preserves strong privacy protections while reducing fairness disparities relative to automated baselines. More importantly, it provides a straightforward, interpretable process for practitioners to manage competing demands of accuracy, privacy, and fairness in socially impactful applications. By embedding human judgment where it matters most, FAIRPLAI offers a pathway to machine learning systems that are effective, responsible, and trustworthy in practice.

Method: Proposed LLM-ABS framework using neutral prompt variations and linguistic analysis of responses to explore system prompt effects on agent behavior.

Result: Agents show strong fairness preferences, significant prompt sensitivity, and different linguistic expression patterns in responses.

Conclusion: While prompt sensitivity remains challenging, the LLM-ABS framework provides a robust foundation for studying LLM agent behavior.

Abstract: In behavioral sciences, experiments such as the ultimatum game are conducted to assess preferences for fairness or self-interest of study participants. In the dictator game, a simplified version of the ultimatum game where only one of two players makes a single decision, the dictator unilaterally decides how to split a fixed sum of money between themselves and the other player. Although recent studies have explored behavioral patterns of AI agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) instructed to adopt different personas, we question the robustness of these results. In particular, many of these studies overlook the role of the system prompt - the underlying instructions that shape the model's behavior - and do not account for how sensitive results can be to slight changes in prompts. However, a robust baseline is essential when studying highly complex behavioral aspects of LLMs. To overcome previous limitations, we propose the LLM agent behavior study (LLM-ABS) framework to (i) explore how different system prompts influence model behavior, (ii) get more reliable insights into agent preferences by using neutral prompt variations, and (iii) analyze linguistic features in responses to open-ended instructions by LLM agents to better understand the reasoning behind their behavior. We found that agents often exhibit a strong preference for fairness, as well as a significant impact of the system prompt on their behavior. From a linguistic perspective, we identify that models express their responses differently. Although prompt sensitivity remains a persistent challenge, our proposed framework demonstrates a robust foundation for LLM agent behavior studies.

### [101] [Macroscopic Emission Modeling of Urban Traffic Using Probe Vehicle Data: A Machine Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08722)
*Mohammed Ali El Adlouni,Ling Jin,Xiaodan Xu,C. Anna Spurlock,Alina Lazar,Kaveh Farokhi Sadabadi,Mahyar Amirgholy,Mona Asudegi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study uses machine learning with large-scale traffic and emission data to predict network-wide emission rates in US urban areas, creating data-driven emission fundamental diagrams (eMFDs) that help understand location-specific factors affecting emissions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban congestion causes inefficient vehicle movement and increases greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. Existing empirically derived eMFD models are limited due to historical data constraints.

Method: Applied machine learning methods using large-scale granular traffic and emission data from probe vehicles to predict network-wide emission rates to traffic relationships in US urban areas.

Result: Generated data-driven eMFDs and developed insights into their location dependence on network characteristics, infrastructure, land use, and vehicle characteristics.

Conclusion: The framework enables transportation authorities to measure carbon emissions from urban transport and optimize location-specific traffic management and planning decisions to reduce network-wide emissions.

Abstract: Urban congestions cause inefficient movement of vehicles and exacerbate greenhouse gas emissions and urban air pollution. Macroscopic emission fundamental diagram (eMFD)captures an orderly relationship among emission and aggregated traffic variables at the network level, allowing for real-time monitoring of region-wide emissions and optimal allocation of travel demand to existing networks, reducing urban congestion and associated emissions. However, empirically derived eMFD models are sparse due to historical data limitation. Leveraging a large-scale and granular traffic and emission data derived from probe vehicles, this study is the first to apply machine learning methods to predict the network wide emission rate to traffic relationship in U.S. urban areas at a large scale. The analysis framework and insights developed in this work generate data-driven eMFDs and a deeper understanding of their location dependence on network, infrastructure, land use, and vehicle characteristics, enabling transportation authorities to measure carbon emissions from urban transport of given travel demand and optimize location specific traffic management and planning decisions to mitigate network-wide emissions.

*Carlos A. Taveras,Santiago Segarra,César A. Uribe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two graph coarsening algorithms (GPC and KGPC) using Gromov-Wasserstein geometry that outperform existing methods on large-scale datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop efficient graph coarsening methods within the Gromov-Wasserstein geometry framework for reducing graph size while preserving structural properties.

Method: GPC iteratively merges node pairs minimizing local distortion; KGPC uses clustering based on pairwise distortion metrics to merge node clusters directly.

Result: The methods outperform existing approaches across six large-scale datasets and downstream clustering tasks under various parameters and scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed Gromov-Wasserstein-based coarsening algorithms provide effective and superior performance for graph size reduction tasks.

Abstract: We study the problem of graph coarsening within the Gromov-Wasserstein geometry. Specifically, we propose two algorithms that leverage a novel representation of the distortion induced by merging pairs of nodes. The first method, termed Greedy Pair Coarsening (GPC), iteratively merges pairs of nodes that locally minimize a measure of distortion until the desired size is achieved. The second method, termed $k$-means Greedy Pair Coarsening (KGPC), leverages clustering based on pairwise distortion metrics to directly merge clusters of nodes. We provide conditions guaranteeing optimal coarsening for our methods and validate their performance on six large-scale datasets and a downstream clustering task. Results show that the proposed methods outperform existing approaches on a wide range of parameters and scenarios.

*Pragya Singh,Islem Rekik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two GNN-agnostic frameworks for graph super-resolution: Bi-SR for structure-aware node super-resolution and DEFEND for edge inference via dual graph mapping, achieving SOTA on brain connectome data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN-based graph super-resolution methods have limitations: matrix-based approaches ignore graph structure and lack permutation invariance, while edge weight inference from node representations limits scalability and expressivity.

Method: Bi-SR uses bipartite graphs connecting LR and HR nodes for structure-aware super-resolution. DEFEND maps HR edges to dual graph nodes for edge inference using standard GNNs. Both frameworks are GNN-agnostic.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on real-world brain connectome dataset across seven topological measures. Introduced twelve simulated datasets for comprehensive benchmarking.

Conclusion: The proposed frameworks address key limitations in graph super-resolution, providing structure-aware and permutation-invariant solutions with improved scalability and expressivity for resource-constrained domains like medical imaging.

Abstract: Graph super-resolution, the task of inferring high-resolution (HR) graphs from low-resolution (LR) counterparts, is an underexplored yet crucial research direction that circumvents the need for costly data acquisition. This makes it especially desirable for resource-constrained fields such as the medical domain. While recent GNN-based approaches show promise, they suffer from two key limitations: (1) matrix-based node super-resolution that disregards graph structure and lacks permutation invariance; and (2) reliance on node representations to infer edge weights, which limits scalability and expressivity. In this work, we propose two GNN-agnostic frameworks to address these issues. First, Bi-SR introduces a bipartite graph connecting LR and HR nodes to enable structure-aware node super-resolution that preserves topology and permutation invariance. Second, DEFEND learns edge representations by mapping HR edges to nodes of a dual graph, allowing edge inference via standard node-based GNNs. We evaluate both frameworks on a real-world brain connectome dataset, where they achieve state-of-the-art performance across seven topological measures. To support generalization, we introduce twelve new simulated datasets that capture diverse topologies and LR-HR relationships. These enable comprehensive benchmarking of graph super-resolution methods.

Motivation: To increase neural network expressivity by enabling network states to contain arbitrarily structured representations that are inherently interpretable, aiming for more general intelligent agents.

Method: Uses Frequency-domain Holographic Reduced Representations (FHRRs) to extend VSA encoding of Lisp 1.5 with arithmetic primitives via Residue Hyperdimensional Computing (RHC).

Result: Created a Turing-complete syntax over high-dimensional vector space that increases neural network state expressivity with structured representations.

Conclusion: This approach enables interpretable structured representations in neural networks and has potential applications in machine learning for developing more general intelligent agents.

Abstract: Using Frequency-domain Holographic Reduced Representations (FHRRs), we extend a Vector-Symbolic Architecture (VSA) encoding of Lisp 1.5 with primitives for arithmetic operations using Residue Hyperdimensional Computing (RHC). Encoding a Turing-complete syntax over a high-dimensional vector space increases the expressivity of neural network states, enabling network states to contain arbitrarily structured representations that are inherently interpretable. We discuss the potential applications of the VSA encoding in machine learning tasks, as well as the importance of encoding structured representations and designing neural networks whose behavior is sensitive to the structure of their representations in virtue of attaining more general intelligent agents than exist at present.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The standard bias-variance decomposition is limited to squared error, but many statistical models use different loss functions like Bregman divergences in maximum likelihood estimation with exponential families.

Method: Presents a standalone derivation of the bias-variance decomposition generalized to Bregman divergences, building on existing but unclear prior work.

Result: Provides a clear, pedagogical derivation of the generalized bias-variance decomposition for Bregman divergences, relevant to exponential family models.

Conclusion: This work fills a pedagogical gap by providing a clear derivation of the bias-variance decomposition for Bregman divergences, making this important statistical concept more accessible for exponential family maximum likelihood estimation.

Abstract: The bias-variance decomposition is a central result in statistics and machine learning, but is typically presented only for the squared error. We present a generalization of the bias-variance decomposition where the prediction error is a Bregman divergence, which is relevant to maximum likelihood estimation with exponential families. While the result is already known, there was not previously a clear, standalone derivation, so we provide one for pedagogical purposes. A version of this note previously appeared on the author's personal website without context. Here we provide additional discussion and references to the relevant prior literature.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BayesQ is an uncertainty-guided post-training quantization framework that optimizes quantization under posterior expected loss, achieving better performance than strong baselines at low bit rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve low-bit quantization by reframing it as uncertainty-aware risk minimization, addressing the limitations of existing PTQ methods that don't consider weight uncertainty.

Method: Fits Gaussian posterior over weights, whitens by posterior covariance, designs codebooks to minimize posterior-expected distortion, allocates mixed precision via greedy knapsack, and uses optional calibration-only distillation.

Result: At 3.0/3.5/4.0 bits/weight, improves over GPTQ by +1.5/+0.7/+0.3 top-1 points on ResNet-50 and +1.1/+0.4/+0.2 GLUE points on BERT-base.

Conclusion: BayesQ successfully reframes low-bit quantization as uncertainty-aware risk minimization in a practical post-training pipeline with comparable preprocessing to GPTQ.

Abstract: We present BayesQ, an uncertainty-guided post-training quantization framework that is the first to optimize quantization under the posterior expected loss. BayesQ fits a lightweight Gaussian posterior over weights (diagonal Laplace by default; optional K-FAC/low-rank), whitens by the posterior covariance, designs codebooks to minimize posterior-expected distortion, and allocates mixed precision via a greedy knapsack that maximizes marginal expected-loss reduction per bit under a global budget. For scalar quantizers, posterior-expected MSE yields closed-form tables; task-aware proxies are handled by short Monte Carlo on a small calibration set. An optional calibration-only distillation aligns the quantized model with the posterior predictive teacher. At matched average bits/weight of 3.0/3.5/4.0, BayesQ improves over strong PTQ baselines on ResNet-50 (ImageNet) and BERT-base (GLUE) e.g., vs. GPTQ by $+1.5/+0.7/+0.3$ top-1 percentage points on RN50 and $+1.1/+0.4/+0.2$ GLUE points on BERT, while requiring one-time preprocessing comparable to a GPTQ pass. BayesQ reframes low-bit quantization as uncertainty-aware risk minimization in a practical, post-training pipeline.

*Tomoki Koike,Elizabeth Qian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A physics-informed machine learning method called LyapInf that infers Lyapunov functions from trajectory data to estimate stability regions without requiring explicit system equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Lyapunov methods require explicit system equations, which are often unavailable for complex systems like aerospace applications, making stability region computation challenging.

Method: Proposes LyapInf method using quadratic form for Lyapunov function and fits unknown quadratic operator by minimizing residual of Zubov equation from trajectory data.

Result: Successfully characterizes near-maximal ellipsoidal stability regions from inferred Lyapunov functions without system equation knowledge, validated on benchmark examples.

Conclusion: LyapInf provides an effective data-driven approach for stability analysis that treats systems as black boxes, enabling stability region estimation without explicit governing equations.

Abstract: In the design and operation of complex dynamical systems, it is essential to ensure that all state trajectories of the dynamical system converge to a desired equilibrium within a guaranteed stability region. Yet, for many practical systems -- especially in aerospace -- this region cannot be determined a priori and is often challenging to compute. One of the most common methods for computing the stability region is to identify a Lyapunov function. A Lyapunov function is a positive function whose time derivative along system trajectories is non-positive, which provides a sufficient condition for stability and characterizes an estimated stability region. However, existing methods of characterizing a stability region via a Lyapunov function often rely on explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In this work, we present a new physics-informed machine learning method of characterizing an estimated stability region by inferring a Lyapunov function from system trajectory data that treats the dynamical system as a black box and does not require explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In our presented Lyapunov function Inference method (LyapInf), we propose a quadratic form for the unknown Lyapunov function and fit the unknown quadratic operator to system trajectory data by minimizing the average residual of the Zubov equation, a first-order partial differential equation whose solution yields a Lyapunov function. The inferred quadratic Lyapunov function can then characterize an ellipsoidal estimate of the stability region. Numerical results on benchmark examples demonstrate that our physics-informed stability analysis method successfully characterizes a near-maximal ellipsoid of the system stability region associated with the inferred Lyapunov function without requiring knowledge of the system governing equations.

*Nikunj Gupta,Ludwika Twardecka,James Zachary Hare,Jesse Milzman,Rajgopal Kannan,Viktor Prasanna*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TIGER enhances multi-agent reinforcement learning by modeling temporal evolution of inter-agent coordination structures using dynamic temporal graphs and temporal attention-based encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most MARL approaches use static relational graphs that overlook the temporal evolution of agent interactions, which is crucial for robust and adaptive coordination as agents adapt and reorganize strategies over time.

Method: Constructs dynamic temporal graphs connecting current and historical agent interactions, then uses temporal attention-based encoder to aggregate information across structural and temporal neighborhoods to create time-aware agent embeddings.

Result: Consistently outperforms diverse value-decomposition and graph-based MARL baselines in task performance and sample efficiency on coordination-intensive benchmarks.

Conclusion: Temporal evolution of coordination structures is essential for effective MARL, and TIGER successfully captures both structural and temporal factors to shape cooperative policy learning.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose capturing and utilizing \textit{Temporal Information through Graph-based Embeddings and Representations} or \textbf{TIGER} to enhance multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We explicitly model how inter-agent coordination structures evolve over time. While most MARL approaches rely on static or per-step relational graphs, they overlook the temporal evolution of interactions that naturally arise as agents adapt, move, or reorganize cooperation strategies. Capturing such evolving dependencies is key to achieving robust and adaptive coordination. To this end, TIGER constructs dynamic temporal graphs of MARL agents, connecting their current and historical interactions. It then employs a temporal attention-based encoder to aggregate information across these structural and temporal neighborhoods, yielding time-aware agent embeddings that guide cooperative policy learning. Through extensive experiments on two coordination-intensive benchmarks, we show that TIGER consistently outperforms diverse value-decomposition and graph-based MARL baselines in task performance and sample efficiency. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to isolate the impact of key design parameters in TIGER, revealing how structural and temporal factors can jointly shape effective policy learning in MARL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DP-PMLF: A novel method combining per-sample momentum and low-pass filtering to simultaneously reduce DP noise and clipping bias in differentially private SGD, improving privacy-utility trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DPSGD methods degrade model accuracy by introducing DP noise and clipping bias, and current techniques typically address only one issue at a time, creating a trade-off problem.

Method: Integrates per-sample momentum to smooth gradient estimates before clipping (reducing sampling variance) and uses post-processing low-pass filtering to attenuate high-frequency DP noise without additional privacy budget.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows improved convergence rate under DP guarantees, and empirical evaluations demonstrate significant enhancement in privacy-utility trade-off compared to state-of-the-art DPSGD variants.

Conclusion: DP-PMLF effectively mitigates both DP noise and clipping bias simultaneously, providing better model accuracy while maintaining rigorous differential privacy guarantees.

Abstract: Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD) is widely used to train deep neural networks with formal privacy guarantees. However, the addition of differential privacy (DP) often degrades model accuracy by introducing both noise and bias. Existing techniques typically address only one of these issues, as reducing DP noise can exacerbate clipping bias and vice-versa. In this paper, we propose a novel method, \emph{DP-PMLF}, which integrates per-sample momentum with a low-pass filtering strategy to simultaneously mitigate DP noise and clipping bias. Our approach uses per-sample momentum to smooth gradient estimates prior to clipping, thereby reducing sampling variance. It further employs a post-processing low-pass filter to attenuate high-frequency DP noise without consuming additional privacy budget. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating an improved convergence rate under rigorous DP guarantees, and our empirical evaluations reveal that DP-PMLF significantly enhances the privacy-utility trade-off compared to several state-of-the-art DPSGD variants.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes topological descriptors (Euler characteristic and persistent homology) on graph products, showing that persistent homology captures more information than individual graphs while Euler characteristic does not. It provides algorithms for computing persistent homology on graph products and demonstrates practical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the expressive power of topological descriptors for relational data by leveraging graph products, which can capture multiscale structural information that individual graphs cannot represent.

Method: The authors consider various filtrations on graph products, establish theoretical characterizations of Euler characteristic's expressive power, develop algorithms for computing persistent homology on vertex- and edge-level filtrations of graph products, and conduct empirical validation.

Result: Persistent homology descriptors of graph products contain strictly more information than individual graphs, while Euler characteristic does not. The algorithms efficiently compute persistent homology diagrams, and empirical results show improved expressivity and graph classification performance.

Conclusion: Graph product filtrations enable more powerful persistent descriptors for graph analysis, with persistent homology providing strictly richer topological information than individual graph analysis.

Abstract: Topological descriptors have been increasingly utilized for capturing multiscale structural information in relational data. In this work, we consider various filtrations on the (box) product of graphs and the effect on their outputs on the topological descriptors - the Euler characteristic (EC) and persistent homology (PH). In particular, we establish a complete characterization of the expressive power of EC on general color-based filtrations. We also show that the PH descriptors of (virtual) graph products contain strictly more information than the computation on individual graphs, whereas EC does not. Additionally, we provide algorithms to compute the PH diagrams of the product of vertex- and edge-level filtrations on the graph product. We also substantiate our theoretical analysis with empirical investigations on runtime analysis, expressivity, and graph classification performance. Overall, this work paves way for powerful graph persistent descriptors via product filtrations. Code is available at https://github.com/Aalto-QuML/tda_graph_product.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap from toy models to real models in mechanistic interpretability by extending parameter decomposition methods to modern Transformer architectures.

Method: Extended Stochastic Parameter Decomposition (SPD) to Transformers with updated causal importance function for sequential data and new loss function.

Result: Successfully decomposed toy induction-head model recovering expected 2-step circuit, and located interpretable subcomponents in GPT-2-small corresponding to concepts like 'golf' and 'basketball'.

Conclusion: First step in extending SPD to modern models, demonstrating ability to surface interpretable parameter-space mechanisms in real-world models.

Abstract: Recent work in mechanistic interpretability has shown that decomposing models in parameter space may yield clean handles for analysis and intervention. Previous methods have demonstrated successful applications on a wide range of toy models, but the gap to "real models" has not yet been bridged. In this work, we extend Stochastic Parameter Decomposition (SPD) to Transformer models, proposing an updated causal importance function suited for sequential data and a new loss function. We demonstrate that SPD can successfully decompose a toy induction-head model and recover the expected 2-step circuit. We also show that applying SPD to GPT-2-small can successfully locate subcomponents corresponding to interpretable concepts like "golf" and "basketball". These results take the first step in the direction of extending SPD to modern models, and show that we can use the method to surface interpretable parameter-space mechanisms.

TL;DR: ForeSWE is a probabilistic spatio-temporal forecasting model for Snow-Water Equivalent (SWE) that combines deep learning with Gaussian processes to provide accurate predictions with uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SWE forecasting is challenging due to spatio-temporal variability influenced by topography and environmental factors. Existing approaches don't adequately use spatial/temporal correlations or provide uncertainty estimates needed for water management decisions.

Method: Integration of deep learning with classical probabilistic techniques, featuring an attention mechanism for spatiotemporal features and a Gaussian process module for uncertainty quantification.

Result: Significant improvements in forecasting accuracy and prediction intervals compared to existing approaches, with effective uncertainty estimates evaluated on 512 SNOTEL stations in Western US.

Conclusion: The model provides a deployable platform for water management with accurate SWE forecasts and principled uncertainty quantification, addressing key limitations of previous methods.

Abstract: Various complex water management decisions are made in snow-dominant watersheds with the knowledge of Snow-Water Equivalent (SWE) -- a key measure widely used to estimate the water content of a snowpack. However, forecasting SWE is challenging because SWE is influenced by various factors including topography and an array of environmental conditions, and has therefore been observed to be spatio-temporally variable. Classical approaches to SWE forecasting have not adequately utilized these spatial/temporal correlations, nor do they provide uncertainty estimates -- which can be of significant value to the decision maker. In this paper, we present ForeSWE, a new probabilistic spatio-temporal forecasting model that integrates deep learning and classical probabilistic techniques. The resulting model features a combination of an attention mechanism to integrate spatiotemporal features and interactions, alongside a Gaussian process module that provides principled quantification of prediction uncertainty. We evaluate the model on data from 512 Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations in the Western US. The results show significant improvements in both forecasting accuracy and prediction interval compared to existing approaches. The results also serve to highlight the efficacy in uncertainty estimates between different approaches. Collectively, these findings have provided a platform for deployment and feedback by the water management community.

TL;DR: EEG-X is a device-agnostic foundation model for EEG analysis that addresses dataset variability and low SNR through location-based channel embeddings and noise-aware training with dictionary-inspired transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current EEG foundation models face challenges with dataset variability from different recording devices/configurations and low signal-to-noise ratio where brain signals are buried under artifacts.

Method: Uses location-based channel embeddings for spatial encoding, noise-aware masking/reconstruction in raw/latent spaces, and dictionary-inspired convolutional transformation (DiCT) layer for structured feature projection.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple EEG tasks and excels in cross-domain settings with different electrode layouts.

Conclusion: EEG-X provides an effective foundation model for EEG analysis that handles device variability and noise robustness through novel architectural components.

Abstract: Foundation models for EEG analysis are still in their infancy, limited by two key challenges: (1) variability across datasets caused by differences in recording devices and configurations, and (2) the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of EEG, where brain signals are often buried under artifacts and non-brain sources. To address these challenges, we present EEG-X, a device-agnostic and noise-robust foundation model for EEG representation learning. EEG-X introduces a novel location-based channel embedding that encodes spatial information and improves generalization across domains and tasks by allowing the model to handle varying channel numbers, combinations, and recording lengths. To enhance robustness against noise, EEG-X employs a noise-aware masking and reconstruction strategy in both raw and latent spaces. Unlike previous models that mask and reconstruct raw noisy EEG signals, EEG-X is trained to reconstruct denoised signals obtained through an artifact removal process, ensuring that the learned representations focus on neural activity rather than noise. To further enhance reconstruction-based pretraining, EEG-X introduces a dictionary-inspired convolutional transformation (DiCT) layer that projects signals into a structured feature space before computing reconstruction (MSE) loss, reducing noise sensitivity and capturing frequency- and shape-aware similarities. Experiments on datasets collected from diverse devices show that EEG-X outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple downstream EEG tasks and excels in cross-domain settings where pre-trained and downstream datasets differ in electrode layouts.

TL;DR: A two-stage deep learning architecture for automated sleep staging that incorporates clinical metadata and expert event annotations to improve accuracy over PSG-only models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual sleep staging is labor-intensive and variable between experts, while current automated methods lack the contextual cues human experts use.

Method: Two-stage architecture with Transformer-based per-epoch encoder and 1D CNN aggregator, incorporating subject-level clinical metadata and per-epoch expert event annotations.

Result: Substantial improvement in staging accuracy: macro-F1 0.8031 and micro-F1 0.9051 vs baseline macro-F1 0.7745 and micro-F1 0.8774, with event annotations providing largest gains.

Conclusion: Augmenting learned representations with clinically meaningful features enhances performance and interpretability, supporting practical context-aware sleep staging systems without additional sensors.

Abstract: Manual sleep staging from polysomnography (PSG) is labor-intensive and prone to inter-scorer variability. While recent deep learning models have advanced automated staging, most rely solely on raw PSG signals and neglect contextual cues used by human experts. We propose a two-stage architecture that combines a Transformer-based per-epoch encoder with a 1D CNN aggregator, and systematically investigates the effect of incorporating explicit context: subject-level clinical metadata (age, sex, BMI) and per-epoch expert event annotations (apneas, desaturations, arousals, periodic breathing). Using the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) cohort (n=8,357), we demonstrate that contextual fusion substantially improves staging accuracy. Compared to a PSG-only baseline (macro-F1 0.7745, micro-F1 0.8774), our final model achieves macro-F1 0.8031 and micro-F1 0.9051, with event annotations contributing the largest gains. Notably, feature fusion outperforms multi-task alternatives that predict the same auxiliary labels. These results highlight that augmenting learned representations with clinically meaningful features enhances both performance and interpretability, without modifying the PSG montage or requiring additional sensors. Our findings support a practical and scalable path toward context-aware, expert-aligned sleep staging systems.

*Andrea Cavallo,Ayushman Raghuvanshi,Sundeep Prabhakar Chepuri,Elvin Isufi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Covariance Scattering Transforms (CSTs) are proposed as deep untrained networks that apply covariance wavelets to capture spectral patterns, offering improved stability over PCA in low-sample regimes without requiring training like VNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PCA fails to capture low-variance information and is unstable with close eigenvalues, while VNNs require training and labeled data. CSTs aim to combine the benefits of both approaches.

Method: CSTs use deep untrained networks with covariance wavelets that apply filters localized in the covariance spectrum, using nonlinearities to create hierarchical representations, with pruning for efficiency.

Result: CSTs show improved stability to estimation errors compared to PCA, perform comparably to VNNs without training, and achieve comparable or better predictions on age prediction tasks from cortical thickness data.

Conclusion: CSTs provide a training-free alternative that combines PCA's unsupervised nature with VNNs' stability and expressiveness, making them effective for low-data covariance-based learning tasks.

Abstract: Machine learning and data processing techniques relying on covariance information are widespread as they identify meaningful patterns in unsupervised and unlabeled settings. As a prominent example, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) projects data points onto the eigenvectors of their covariance matrix, capturing the directions of maximum variance. This mapping, however, falls short in two directions: it fails to capture information in low-variance directions, relevant when, e.g., the data contains high-variance noise; and it provides unstable results in low-sample regimes, especially when covariance eigenvalues are close. CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs), i.e., graph neural networks using the covariance matrix as a graph, show improved stability to estimation errors and learn more expressive functions in the covariance spectrum than PCA, but require training and operate in a labeled setup. To get the benefits of both worlds, we propose Covariance Scattering Transforms (CSTs), deep untrained networks that sequentially apply filters localized in the covariance spectrum to the input data and produce expressive hierarchical representations via nonlinearities. We define the filters as covariance wavelets that capture specific and detailed covariance spectral patterns. We improve CSTs' computational and memory efficiency via a pruning mechanism, and we prove that their error due to finite-sample covariance estimations is less sensitive to close covariance eigenvalues compared to PCA, improving their stability. Our experiments on age prediction from cortical thickness measurements on 4 datasets collecting patients with neurodegenerative diseases show that CSTs produce stable representations in low-data settings, as VNNs but without any training, and lead to comparable or better predictions w.r.t. more complex learning models.

*Oliver Wang,Pengrui Quan,Kang Yang,Mani Srivastava*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Spectral predictability (Ω) is a fast metric that stratifies time series model performance, enabling efficient model selection by predicting when large foundation models outperform simpler alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practitioners face computational challenges in exhaustive model validation for time series forecasting, risking poor performance from wrong model choices.

Method: Used spectral predictability (Ω) metric in controlled experiments across 4 domains and expanded analysis to 51 models and 28 datasets from GIFT-Eval benchmark.

Result: Large time series foundation models outperform lightweight baselines when Ω is high, but their advantage disappears when Ω is low. Ω computation takes seconds per dataset.

Conclusion: Ω provides a practical first-pass filter that reduces validation costs and highlights the need for models that perform well on genuinely difficult (low-Ω) problems.

Abstract: Practitioners deploying time series forecasting models face a dilemma: exhaustively validating dozens of models is computationally prohibitive, yet choosing the wrong model risks poor performance. We show that spectral predictability~$Ω$ -- a simple signal processing metric -- systematically stratifies model family performance, enabling fast model selection. We conduct controlled experiments in four different domains, then further expand our analysis to 51 models and 28 datasets from the GIFT-Eval benchmark. We find that large time series foundation models (TSFMs) systematically outperform lightweight task-trained baselines when $Ω$ is high, while their advantage vanishes as $Ω$ drops. Computing $Ω$ takes seconds per dataset, enabling practitioners to quickly assess whether their data suits TSFM approaches or whether simpler, cheaper models suffice. We demonstrate that $Ω$ stratifies model performance predictably, offering a practical first-pass filter that reduces validation costs while highlighting the need for models that excel on genuinely difficult (low-$Ω$) problems rather than merely optimizing easy ones.

Conclusion: Provides both practical advances and theoretical insights for fair medical AI systems, with convergence guarantees and fairness bounds supporting the framework's effectiveness in ensuring equitable healthcare access.

Abstract: Stroke is an acute cerebrovascular disease, and timely diagnosis significantly improves patient survival. However, existing automated diagnosis methods suffer from fairness issues across demographic groups, potentially exacerbating healthcare disparities. In this work we propose FAST-CAD, a theoretically grounded framework that combines domain-adversarial training (DAT) with group distributionally robust optimization (Group-DRO) for fair and accurate non-contact stroke diagnosis. Our approach is built on domain adaptation and minimax fairness theory and provides convergence guarantees and fairness bounds. We curate a multimodal dataset covering 12 demographic subgroups defined by age, gender, and posture. FAST-CAD employs self-supervised encoders with adversarial domain discrimination to learn demographic-invariant representations, while Group-DRO optimizes worst-group risk to ensure robust performance across all subgroups. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior diagnostic performance while maintaining fairness across demographic groups, and our theoretical analysis supports the effectiveness of the unified DAT + Group-DRO framework. This work provides both practical advances and theoretical insights for fair medical AI systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Weaver is an efficient spatiotemporal forecasting model that uses Kronecker product approximations to decompose attention maps, reducing computational complexity while maintaining competitive performance on traffic datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transportation networks require forecasting models that are accurate, interpretable, efficient, and robust. Current Transformer-based models achieve good performance but suffer from high computational overhead and poor interpretability.

Method: Uses Kronecker product approximations to decompose spatiotemporal attention into separate temporal and spatial components, introduces Valence Attention with Tanimoto coefficient for negative edge modeling, and employs Traffic Phase Dictionary for self-conditioning.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on PEMS-BAY and METR-LA datasets while training more efficiently than existing approaches.

Conclusion: Weaver provides an efficient and effective solution for spatiotemporal forecasting on transportation networks, balancing performance with computational efficiency through innovative attention decomposition techniques.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal forecasting on transportation networks is a complex task that requires understanding how traffic nodes interact within a dynamic, evolving system dictated by traffic flow dynamics and social behavioral patterns. The importance of transportation networks and ITS for modern mobility and commerce necessitates forecasting models that are not only accurate but also interpretable, efficient, and robust under structural or temporal perturbations. Recent approaches, particularly Transformer-based architectures, have improved predictive performance but often at the cost of high computational overhead and diminished architectural interpretability. In this work, we introduce Weaver, a novel attention-based model that applies Kronecker product approximations (KPA) to decompose the PN X PN spatiotemporal attention of O(P^2N^2) complexity into local P X P temporal and N X N spatial attention maps. This Kronecker attention map enables our Parallel-Kronecker Matrix-Vector product (P2-KMV) for efficient spatiotemporal message passing with O(P^2N + N^2P) complexity. To capture real-world traffic dynamics, we address the importance of negative edges in modeling traffic behavior by introducing Valence Attention using the continuous Tanimoto coefficient (CTC), which provides properties conducive to precise latent graph generation and training stability. To fully utilize the model's learning capacity, we introduce the Traffic Phase Dictionary for self-conditioning. Evaluations on PEMS-BAY and METR-LA show that Weaver achieves competitive performance across model categories while training more efficiently.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based offline RL methods apply indiscriminate regularization to redundant actions in low-quality datasets, causing excessive conservatism and imbalance between diffusion model expressiveness and efficiency.

Method: Proposes DIVO with binary-weighted mechanism using advantage values to guide diffusion model training, enabling precise dataset alignment while selectively expanding high-advantage action boundaries. Dynamically filters high-return-potential actions during policy improvement.

Result: Achieves superior performance on D4RL benchmark, with significant improvements in average returns across locomotion tasks and outperforms existing methods in challenging AntMaze domain with sparse rewards.

Conclusion: DIVO effectively balances conservatism and explorability in offline RL by leveraging value-conditional optimization with diffusion models, addressing key limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: In offline reinforcement learning, value overestimation caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions significantly limits policy performance. Recently, diffusion models have been leveraged for their strong distribution-matching capabilities, enforcing conservatism through behavior policy constraints. However, existing methods often apply indiscriminate regularization to redundant actions in low-quality datasets, resulting in excessive conservatism and an imbalance between the expressiveness and efficiency of diffusion modeling. To address these issues, we propose DIffusion policies with Value-conditional Optimization (DIVO), a novel approach that leverages diffusion models to generate high-quality, broadly covered in-distribution state-action samples while facilitating efficient policy improvement. Specifically, DIVO introduces a binary-weighted mechanism that utilizes the advantage values of actions in the offline dataset to guide diffusion model training. This enables a more precise alignment with the dataset's distribution while selectively expanding the boundaries of high-advantage actions. During policy improvement, DIVO dynamically filters high-return-potential actions from the diffusion model, effectively guiding the learned policy toward better performance. This approach achieves a critical balance between conservatism and explorability in offline RL. We evaluate DIVO on the D4RL benchmark and compare it against state-of-the-art baselines. Empirical results demonstrate that DIVO achieves superior performance, delivering significant improvements in average returns across locomotion tasks and outperforming existing methods in the challenging AntMaze domain, where sparse rewards pose a major difficulty.

Conclusion: QIBONN provides an effective quantum-inspired approach for neural network hyperparameter optimization that balances exploration and exploitation while being competitive with existing methods.

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) for neural networks on tabular data is critical to a wide range of applications, yet it remains challenging due to large, non-convex search spaces and the cost of exhaustive tuning. We introduce the Quantum-Inspired Bilevel Optimizer for Neural Networks (QIBONN), a bilevel framework that encodes feature selection, architectural hyperparameters, and regularization in a unified qubit-based representation. By combining deterministic quantum-inspired rotations with stochastic qubit mutations guided by a global attractor, QIBONN balances exploration and exploitation under a fixed evaluation budget. We conduct systematic experiments under single-qubit bit-flip noise (0.1\%--1\%) emulated by an IBM-Q backend. Results on 13 real-world datasets indicate that QIBONN is competitive with established methods, including classical tree-based methods and both classical/quantum-inspired HPO algorithms under the same tuning budget.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel backdoor removal method that accurately reconstructs Trigger-Activated Changes (TAC) values in latent representation to identify and remove backdoor neurons more precisely than existing defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor defense methods suffer from low precision in identifying true backdoor neurons due to inaccurate estimation of TAC values, which are the activation differences between clean and poisoned data.

Method: Formulate minimal perturbation that forces clean data to be classified into a specific class as a convex quadratic optimization problem, use the optimal solution as surrogate for TAC, identify poisoned class by detecting statistically small L2 norms of perturbations, and leverage this in fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and TinyImageNet show superior backdoor suppression with high clean accuracy across different attack types, datasets, and architectures.

Conclusion: The proposed approach consistently outperforms existing defense methods in backdoor removal while maintaining high clean accuracy.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a critical threat to machine learning models, causing them to behave normally on clean data but misclassify poisoned data into a poisoned class. Existing defenses often attempt to identify and remove backdoor neurons based on Trigger-Activated Changes (TAC) which is the activation differences between clean and poisoned data. These methods suffer from low precision in identifying true backdoor neurons due to inaccurate estimation of TAC values. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor removal method by accurately reconstructing TAC values in the latent representation. Specifically, we formulate the minimal perturbation that forces clean data to be classified into a specific class as a convex quadratic optimization problem, whose optimal solution serves as a surrogate for TAC. We then identify the poisoned class by detecting statistically small $L^2$ norms of perturbations and leverage the perturbation of the poisoned class in fine-tuning to remove backdoors. Experiments on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and TinyImageNet demonstrated that our approach consistently achieves superior backdoor suppression with high clean accuracy across different attack types, datasets, and architectures, outperforming existing defense methods.

*Tuhin Subhra De*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper improves conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE) for image generation by making the Gaussian decoder variance learnable and using normalizing flows to better estimate the conditional latent distribution, achieving better results than traditional CVAEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite diffusion models becoming SOTA, the authors explore improving traditional CVAEs to incorporate desired attributes in images, addressing issues like blurry outputs and incorrect assumptions about latent space distributions.

Method: Proposes making the Gaussian decoder variance learnable during training and uses normalizing flows to properly estimate the conditional distribution of latent space given labels, rather than assuming it equals the prior distribution.

Result: The method reduces FID by 5% and increases log likelihood by 7.7% compared to previous CVAE approaches, demonstrating improved image generation quality.

Conclusion: Even in the era of diffusion models, traditional generative models like CVAEs can be significantly improved with proper latent space modeling and learnable parameters, achieving competitive performance gains.

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks remained the state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models until 2022. Now they are superseded by diffusion based models. Efforts to improve traditional models have stagnated as a result. In old-school fashion, we explore image generation with conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE) to incorporate desired attributes within the images. VAEs are known to produce blurry images with less diversity, we refer a method that solve this issue by leveraging the variance of the gaussian decoder as a learnable parameter during training. Previous works on CVAEs assumed that the conditional distribution of the latent space given the labels is equal to the prior distribution, which is not the case in reality. We show that estimating it using normalizing flows results in better image generation than existing methods by reducing the FID by 5% and increasing log likelihood by 7.7% than the previous case.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable reliable uncertainty estimation in fine-tuned LLMs without changing training procedures or adding parameters, leveraging the existing modular structure of Mixture-of-Experts models.

Method: Applies structured Laplace approximation to the second linear layer of each expert in MoE models, uses Kronecker-factored low-rank approximations for curvature modeling, and performs block-wise posterior estimation.

Result: Experiments on Qwen1.5-MoE and DeepSeek-MoE show improvements in expected calibration error (ECE) and negative log-likelihood (NLL) over baselines on common-sense reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Bayesian-MoE effectively provides calibrated uncertainty estimation for reliable downstream decision-making in MoE-based LLMs without requiring training modifications.

Abstract: We present Bayesian Mixture of Experts (Bayesian-MoE), a post-hoc uncertainty estimation framework for fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) based on Mixture-of-Experts architectures. Our method applies a structured Laplace approximation to the second linear layer of each expert, enabling calibrated uncertainty estimation without modifying the original training procedure or introducing new parameters. Unlike prior approaches, which apply Bayesian inference to added adapter modules, Bayesian-MoE directly targets the expert pathways already present in MoE models, leveraging their modular design for tractable block-wise posterior estimation. We use Kronecker-factored low-rank approximations to model curvature and derive scalable estimates of predictive uncertainty and marginal likelihood. Experiments on common-sense reasoning benchmarks with Qwen1.5-MoE and DeepSeek-MoE demonstrate that Bayesian-MoE improves both expected calibration error (ECE) and negative log-likelihood (NLL) over baselines, confirming its effectiveness for reliable downstream decision-making.

TL;DR: Proposes Selective Sinkhorn Routing (SSR) for Sparse Mixture-of-Experts models, replacing auxiliary losses with lightweight optimal transport-based routing to achieve better expert balancing and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SMoE models rely on auxiliary losses and additional parameters for expert diversity, causing objective misalignment and complexity. Sinkhorn-based methods have high computational overhead.

Method: Formulates token-to-expert assignment as optimal transport problem with balanced utilization constraints. SSR derives gating scores from transport map and uses lightweight Sinkhorn routing without auxiliary losses.

Result: SSR achieves faster training, higher accuracy, and greater robustness to input corruption across language modeling and image classification tasks.

Conclusion: SSR provides effective expert balancing without auxiliary losses, improving SMoE performance through optimal transport-based routing with reduced computational overhead.

Abstract: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) has gained prominence as a scalable and computationally efficient architecture, enabling significant growth in model capacity without incurring additional inference costs. However, existing SMoE models often rely on auxiliary losses (e.g., z-loss, load balancing) and additional trainable parameters (e.g., noisy gating) to encourage expert diversity, leading to objective misalignment and increased model complexity. Moreover, existing Sinkhorn-based methods suffer from significant training overhead due to their heavy reliance on the computationally expensive Sinkhorn algorithm. In this work, we formulate token-to-expert assignment as an optimal transport problem, incorporating constraints to ensure balanced expert utilization. We demonstrate that introducing a minimal degree of optimal transport-based routing enhances SMoE performance without requiring auxiliary balancing losses. Unlike previous methods, our approach derives gating scores directly from the transport map, enabling more effective token-to-expert balancing, supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical results. Building on these insights, we propose Selective Sinkhorn Routing (SSR), a routing mechanism that replaces auxiliary loss with lightweight Sinkhorn-based routing. SSR promotes balanced token assignments while preserving flexibility in expert selection. Across both language modeling and image classification tasks, SSR achieves faster training, higher accuracy, and greater robustness to input corruption.

Motivation: Traditional RCTs for medical AI tools are too costly and slow to keep pace with rapid model iterations, creating a bottleneck for timely validation and clinical translation.

Method: The BRIDGE design reuses participant-level data from previous AI model trials when concordance exists between legacy and updated models' predictions, with a practical checklist to ensure valid causal inference and type I error control.

Result: Real-world datasets showed up to 64.8% overlap in high-risk cohorts between successive AI models. Simulation studies demonstrated 46.6% reduction in required enrollment (saving over $2.8M) while maintaining 80% power.

Conclusion: BRIDGE transforms trials into adaptive, modular studies, making Level I evidence generation feasible for every model iteration and accelerating cost-effective translation of AI into routine care.

Abstract: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are indispensable for establishing the clinical value of medical artificial-intelligence (AI) tools, yet their high cost and long timelines hinder timely validation as new models emerge rapidly. Here, we propose BRIDGE, a data-reuse RCT design for AI-based risk models. AI risk models support a broad range of interventions, including screening, treatment selection, and clinical alerts. BRIDGE trials recycle participant-level data from completed trials of AI models when legacy and updated models make concordant predictions, thereby reducing the enrollment requirement for subsequent trials. We provide a practical checklist for investigators to assess whether reusing data from previous trials allows for valid causal inference and preserves type I error. Using real-world datasets across breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and sepsis, we demonstrate concordance between successive AI models, with up to 64.8% overlap in top 5% high-risk cohorts. We then simulate a series of breast cancer screening studies, where our design reduced required enrollment by 46.6%--saving over US$2.8 million--while maintaining 80% power. By transforming trials into adaptive, modular studies, our proposed design makes Level I evidence generation feasible for every model iteration, thereby accelerating cost-effective translation of AI into routine care.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard intrinsic manifold clustering methods face computational challenges on high-dimensional non-Euclidean manifolds, requiring efficient alternatives.

Method: Use p-Fréchet maps to embed manifold data into lower-dimensional Euclidean space using reference points, then apply standard Euclidean clustering techniques like k-means.

Result: Reduces runtime by up to two orders of magnitude compared to intrinsic manifold approaches while maintaining high clustering accuracy, even in challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: The p-Fréchet map framework provides an efficient and accurate solution for manifold clustering, overcoming computational bottlenecks of traditional intrinsic methods.

Abstract: We introduce a novel, efficient framework for clustering data on high-dimensional, non-Euclidean manifolds that overcomes the computational challenges associated with standard intrinsic methods. The key innovation is the use of the $p$-Fréchet map $F^p : \mathcal{M} \to \mathbb{R}^\ell$ -- defined on a generic metric space $\mathcal{M}$ -- which embeds the manifold data into a lower-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^\ell$ using a set of reference points $\{r_i\}_{i=1}^\ell$, $r_i \in \mathcal{M}$. Once embedded, we can efficiently and accurately apply standard Euclidean clustering techniques such as k-means. We rigorously analyze the mathematical properties of $F^p$ in the Euclidean space and the challenging manifold of $n \times n$ symmetric positive definite matrices $\mathit{SPD}(n)$. Extensive numerical experiments using synthetic and real $\mathit{SPD}(n)$ data demonstrate significant performance gains: our method reduces runtime by up to two orders of magnitude compared to intrinsic manifold-based approaches, all while maintaining high clustering accuracy, including scenarios where existing alternative methods struggle or fail.

Conclusion: FLAD opens up new possibilities for future collaborative autonomous driving model training and knowledge sharing by enabling privacy-preserving, efficient distributed training of LLMs across heterogeneous vehicle environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have impressive data fusion and reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving (AD). However, training LLMs for AD faces significant challenges including high computation transmission costs, and privacy concerns associated with sensitive driving data. Federated Learning (FL) is promising for enabling autonomous vehicles (AVs) to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data. We present Federated LLM-based Autonomous Driving (FLAD), an FL framework that leverages distributed multimodal sensory data across AVs in heterogeneous environment. FLAD has three key innovations: (1) a cloud-edge-vehicle collaborative architecture that reduces communication delay and preserving data privacy; (2) an intelligent parallelized collaborative training with a communication scheduling mechanism that optimizes training efficiency, leveraging end-devices otherwise having insufficient resources for model training; and (3) a knowledge distillation method that personalizes LLM according to heterogeneous edge data. In addition, we prototype FLAD in a testbed with NVIDIA Jetsons, overcoming practical implementation challenges including CPU/GPU memory sharing in resource-constrained devices, dynamic model partitions, and fault-tolerant training.Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that FLAD achieves superior end-to-end AD performance while efficiently utilizing distributed vehicular resources, opening up new possibilities for future collaborative AD model training and knowledge sharing.

Nevertheless, differences in data distribution (such as covariate and semantic shifts) severely affect its reliability in real-world deployments. To address this issue, we propose FedSDWC, a causal inference method that integrates both invariant and variant features. FedSDWC infers causal semantic representations by modeling the weak causal influence between invariant and variant features, effectively overcoming the limitations of existing invariant learning methods in accurately capturing invariant features and directly constructing causal representations. This approach significantly enhances FL's ability to generalize and detect OOD data. Theoretically, we derive FedSDWC's generalization error bound under specific conditions and, for the first time, establish its relationship with client prior distributions. Moreover, extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets validate the superior performance of FedSDWC in handling covariate and semantic shifts. For example, FedSDWC outperforms FedICON, the next best baseline, by an average of 3.04% on CIFAR-10 and 8.11% on CIFAR-100.

Abstract: Fairness in AI-driven stress detection is critical for equitable mental healthcare, yet existing models frequently exhibit gender bias, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. To address this, we propose FairM2S, a fairness-aware meta-learning framework for stress detection leveraging audio-visual data. FairM2S integrates Equalized Odds constraints during both meta-training and adaptation phases, employing adversarial gradient masking and fairness-constrained meta-updates to effectively mitigate bias. Evaluated against five state-of-the-art baselines, FairM2S achieves 78.1% accuracy while reducing the Equal Opportunity to 0.06, demonstrating substantial fairness gains. We also release SAVSD, a smartphone-captured dataset with gender annotations, designed to support fairness research in low-resource, real-world contexts. Together, these contributions position FairM2S as a state-of-the-art approach for equitable and scalable few-shot stress detection in mental health AI. We release our dataset and FairM2S publicly with this paper.

### [132] [GeoGNN: Quantifying and Mitigating Semantic Drift in Text-Attributed Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09042)
*Liangwei Yang,Jing Ma,Jianguo Zhang,Zhiwei Liu,Jielin Qiu,Shirley Kokane,Shiyu Wang,Haolin Chen,Rithesh Murthy,Ming Zhu,Huan Wang,Weiran Yao,Caiming Xiong,Shelby Heinecke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes GeoGNN, a manifold-aware graph neural network that uses geodesic aggregation on semantic manifolds to prevent semantic drift in text-attributed graphs, outperforming traditional linear aggregation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear aggregation in GNNs distorts the geometrically structured representation spaces of pretrained language models, causing semantic drift where aggregated representations deviate from the intrinsic semantic manifolds.

Method: Introduces Geodesic Aggregation using log-exp mappings on the unit sphere to aggregate neighbor information along geodesics, and develops GeoGNN with spherical attention and manifold interpolation.

Result: Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show GeoGNN substantially mitigates semantic drift and consistently outperforms strong baselines across multiple text encoders.

Conclusion: Manifold-aware aggregation is crucial for text-attributed graph learning to preserve semantic fidelity and expressive power during message passing.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) on text--attributed graphs (TAGs) typically encode node texts using pretrained language models (PLMs) and propagate these embeddings through linear neighborhood aggregation. However, the representation spaces of modern PLMs are highly non--linear and geometrically structured, where textual embeddings reside on curved semantic manifolds rather than flat Euclidean spaces. Linear aggregation on such manifolds inevitably distorts geometry and causes semantic drift--a phenomenon where aggregated representations deviate from the intrinsic manifold, losing semantic fidelity and expressive power. To quantitatively investigate this problem, this work introduces a local PCA--based metric that measures the degree of semantic drift and provides the first quantitative framework to analyze how different aggregation mechanisms affect manifold structure. Building upon these insights, we propose Geodesic Aggregation, a manifold--aware mechanism that aggregates neighbor information along geodesics via log--exp mappings on the unit sphere, ensuring that representations remain faithful to the semantic manifold during message passing. We further develop GeoGNN, a practical instantiation that integrates spherical attention with manifold interpolation. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets and multiple text encoders show that GeoGNN substantially mitigates semantic drift and consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing the importance of manifold--aware aggregation in text--attributed graph learning.

*Shengbo Wang,Hong Sun,Ke Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces improvements to dueling bandit algorithms for interactive preference elicitation by using feedback augmentation to address sparse human feedback, achieving competitive performance across various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce human effort in preference elicitation systems while addressing the inefficiency of existing dueling bandit algorithms when human feedback is sparse, without relying on rigid parametric reward models.

Method: Proposes augmented confidence bounds to integrate augmented human feedback under generalized concentration properties, and analyzes performance trade-offs via regret analysis within a model-free dueling bandit framework.

Result: The prototype algorithm achieves competitive performance across several interactive preference elicitation benchmarks including recommendation systems, multi-objective optimization, and response optimization for large language models.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates potential for provably efficient interactive preference elicitation in broader applications by effectively handling sparse feedback through feedback augmentation in a model-free framework.

Abstract: Interactive preference elicitation (IPE) aims to substantially reduce human effort while acquiring human preferences in wide personalization systems. Dueling bandit (DB) algorithms enable optimal decision-making in IPE building on pairwise comparisons. However, they remain inefficient when human feedback is sparse. Existing methods address sparsity by heavily relying on parametric reward models, whose rigid assumptions are vulnerable to misspecification. In contrast, we explore an alternative perspective based on feedback augmentation, and introduce critical improvements to the model-free DB framework. Specifically, we introduce augmented confidence bounds to integrate augmented human feedback under generalized concentration properties, and analyze the multi-factored performance trade-off via regret analysis. Our prototype algorithm achieves competitive performance across several IPE benchmarks, including recommendation, multi-objective optimization, and response optimization for large language models, demonstrating the potential of our approach for provably efficient IPE in broader applications.

*Anthony Baez,Wang Zhang,Ziwen Ma,Lam Nguyen,Subhro Das,Luca Daniel*

TL;DR: PINN-Proj: A projection method that guarantees conservation of linear and quadratic integrals in Physics-Informed Neural Networks, reducing conservation errors by 3-4 orders of magnitude.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard PINNs use soft constraints that can violate physical conservation laws, so a method is needed to guarantee conservation of integral quantities.

Method: Derived projection formulae by solving constrained non-linear optimization problems and integrated into PINNs as PINN-Proj.

Result: Reduced conservation errors by 3-4 orders of magnitude compared to soft constraints, with marginal reduction in PDE solution error and improved convergence.

Conclusion: PINN-Proj provides a general framework to guarantee conservation of any integral quantity in PINNs when tractable solutions exist.

Abstract: We propose a novel projection method that guarantees the conservation of integral quantities in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). While the soft constraint that PINNs use to enforce the structure of partial differential equations (PDEs) enables necessary flexibility during training, it also permits the discovered solution to violate physical laws. To address this, we introduce a projection method that guarantees the conservation of the linear and quadratic integrals, both separately and jointly. We derived the projection formulae by solving constrained non-linear optimization problems and found that our PINN modified with the projection, which we call PINN-Proj, reduced the error in the conservation of these quantities by three to four orders of magnitude compared to the soft constraint and marginally reduced the PDE solution error. We also found evidence that the projection improved convergence through improving the conditioning of the loss landscape. Our method holds promise as a general framework to guarantee the conservation of any integral quantity in a PINN if a tractable solution exists.

*Mingjie Zhao,Zhanpei Huang,Yang Lu,Mengke Li,Yiqun Zhang,Weifeng Su,Yiu-ming Cheung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to learn customized distance metrics for categorical attributes by breaking fixed topological relationships between categories, enabling flexible clustering of categorical and mixed datasets with superior accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Categorical attributes lack well-defined relationships between their values, which limits the exploration of compact clusters in categorical data. Existing methods assume fixed topological relationships between categories, leading to suboptimal clustering performance.

Method: The method breaks intrinsic relationship ties of attribute categories and learns customized distance metrics suitable for revealing various cluster distributions. The learned category relationships are Euclidean distance metric-compatible, allowing extension to mixed datasets with both numerical and categorical attributes.

Result: Comparative experiments on 12 real benchmark datasets show superior clustering accuracy with an average ranking of 1.25, significantly higher than the 5.21 ranking of the current best-performing method.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly enhances clustering algorithm fitting ability through learnable category relationships, providing a flexible and accurate approach for clustering categorical and mixed datasets.

Abstract: Categorical attributes with qualitative values are ubiquitous in cluster analysis of real datasets. Unlike the Euclidean distance of numerical attributes, the categorical attributes lack well-defined relationships of their possible values (also called categories interchangeably), which hampers the exploration of compact categorical data clusters. Although most attempts are made for developing appropriate distance metrics, they typically assume a fixed topological relationship between categories when learning distance metrics, which limits their adaptability to varying cluster structures and often leads to suboptimal clustering performance. This paper, therefore, breaks the intrinsic relationship tie of attribute categories and learns customized distance metrics suitable for flexibly and accurately revealing various cluster distributions. As a result, the fitting ability of the clustering algorithm is significantly enhanced, benefiting from the learnable category relationships. Moreover, the learned category relationships are proved to be Euclidean distance metric-compatible, enabling a seamless extension to mixed datasets that include both numerical and categorical attributes. Comparative experiments on 12 real benchmark datasets with significance tests show the superior clustering accuracy of the proposed method with an average ranking of 1.25, which is significantly higher than the 5.21 ranking of the current best-performing method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) generate labels with dual limitations: low quality (label noise) and absence of error correction mechanisms, requiring a solution to enhance label quality efficiently.

Method: HCL strategically deploys human correction only for instances with VLM discrepancies, uses a risk-consistent estimator incorporating both human-corrected labels and VLM predictions, and employs a conditional probability method to estimate label distribution.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior classification performance and robustness to label noise, validating HCL's effectiveness in practical weak supervision scenarios.

Conclusion: HCL provides an effective approach for improving VLM-generated labels through strategic human correction, achieving both higher annotation quality and reduced labor costs in weak supervision settings.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), with their powerful content generation capabilities, have been successfully applied to data annotation processes. However, the VLM-generated labels exhibit dual limitations: low quality (i.e., label noise) and absence of error correction mechanisms. To enhance label quality, we propose Human-Corrected Labels (HCLs), a novel setting that efficient human correction for VLM-generated noisy labels. As shown in Figure 1(b), HCL strategically deploys human correction only for instances with VLM discrepancies, achieving both higher-quality annotations and reduced labor costs. Specifically, we theoretically derive a risk-consistent estimator that incorporates both human-corrected labels and VLM predictions to train classifiers. Besides, we further propose a conditional probability method to estimate the label distribution using a combination of VLM outputs and model predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior classification performance and is robust to label noise, validating the effectiveness of HCL in practical weak supervision scenarios.

*Ziwei Li,Shuzi Niu,Tao Yuan,Huiyuan Li,Wenjia Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a neural network approach to reduce fill-ins in sparse matrix LU factorization by learning optimal reordering through l1 norm minimization of triangular factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fill-ins during LU factorization increase memory and computational costs for sparse matrices. Existing methods use surrogate objectives without theoretical guarantees for fill-in reduction.

Method: Uses graph encoder to predict node scores, reparameterization to get permutation matrices, and optimizes l1 norm of triangular factors using ADMM and proximal gradient descent.

Result: Achieves 20% reduction in fill-in number and 17.8% reduction in LU factorization time compared to state-of-the-art methods on SuiteSparse benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively reduces fill-ins and computational time for sparse matrix factorization through learned reordering with theoretical foundation.

Abstract: Fill-ins are new nonzero elements in the summation of the upper and lower triangular factors generated during LU factorization. For large sparse matrices, they will increase the memory usage and computational time, and be reduced through proper row or column arrangement, namely matrix reordering. Finding a row or column permutation with the minimal fill-ins is NP-hard, and surrogate objectives are designed to derive fill-in reduction permutations or learn a reordering function. However, there is no theoretical guarantee between the golden criterion and these surrogate objectives. Here we propose to learn a reordering network by minimizing \(l_1\) norm of triangular factors of the reordered matrix to approximate the exact number of fill-ins. The reordering network utilizes a graph encoder to predict row or column node scores. For inference, it is easy and fast to derive the permutation from sorting algorithms for matrices. For gradient based optimization, there is a large gap between the predicted node scores and resultant triangular factors in the optimization objective. To bridge the gap, we first design two reparameterization techniques to obtain the permutation matrix from node scores. The matrix is reordered by multiplying the permutation matrix. Then we introduce the factorization process into the objective function to arrive at target triangular factors. The overall objective function is optimized with the alternating direction method of multipliers and proximal gradient descent. Experimental results on benchmark sparse matrix collection SuiteSparse show the fill-in number and LU factorization time reduction of our proposed method is 20% and 17.8% compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedPM is a novel Federated Learning method that uses second-order optimization with preconditioned mixing on the server to mitigate local preconditioner drift in heterogeneous data settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing second-order FL methods suffer from drift in local preconditioners, which disrupts convergence, especially with heterogeneous client data.

Method: Decompose ideal second-order update into server-side preconditioned parameter mixing and client-side local parameter updates, preventing preconditioner drift.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows superlinear convergence for strongly convex objectives with single local update. Experiments demonstrate significant test accuracy improvements over conventional methods.

Conclusion: FedPM effectively leverages second-order optimization potential in FL by addressing preconditioner drift through novel preconditioned mixing approach.

Abstract: We propose Federated Preconditioned Mixing (FedPM), a novel Federated Learning (FL) method that leverages second-order optimization. Prior methods--such as LocalNewton, LTDA, and FedSophia--have incorporated second-order optimization in FL by performing iterative local updates on clients and applying simple mixing of local parameters on the server. However, these methods often suffer from drift in local preconditioners, which significantly disrupts the convergence of parameter training, particularly in heterogeneous data settings. To overcome this issue, we refine the update rules by decomposing the ideal second-order update--computed using globally preconditioned global gradients--into parameter mixing on the server and local parameter updates on clients. As a result, our FedPM introduces preconditioned mixing of local parameters on the server, effectively mitigating drift in local preconditioners.
  We provide a theoretical convergence analysis demonstrating a superlinear rate for strongly convex objectives in scenarios involving a single local update. To demonstrate the practical benefits of FedPM, we conducted extensive experiments. The results showed significant improvements with FedPM in the test accuracy compared to conventional methods incorporating simple mixing, fully leveraging the potential of second-order optimization.

TL;DR: Theoretical analysis of minimum-cost poisoning attacks on LLMs during RLHF/DPO alignment by flipping preference labels, with bounds on attack cost and a post-processing method to reduce required label flips.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding vulnerabilities in LLMs deployed in real-world systems, particularly the theoretical foundations of data poisoning attacks during RLHF/DPO alignment that have been studied empirically but lack theoretical clarity.

Method: Formulate the poisoning attack as a convex optimization problem with linear constraints to derive lower and upper bounds on minimum attack cost, and propose a post-processing method to reduce label flips while preserving poisoning effects.

Result: Derived theoretical bounds on minimum poisoning cost and showed that existing label-flipping attacks can be post-processed to significantly reduce required label flips, especially when reward model's feature dimension is small relative to dataset size.

Conclusion: The findings reveal fundamental vulnerabilities in RLHF/DPO pipelines and provide tools to evaluate robustness against low-cost poisoning attacks, highlighting the need for improved security measures in LLM alignment processes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems, making it critical to understand their vulnerabilities. While data poisoning attacks during RLHF/DPO alignment have been studied empirically, their theoretical foundations remain unclear. We investigate the minimum-cost poisoning attack required to steer an LLM's policy toward an attacker's target by flipping preference labels during RLHF/DPO, without altering the compared outputs. We formulate this as a convex optimization problem with linear constraints, deriving lower and upper bounds on the minimum attack cost. As a byproduct of this theoretical analysis, we show that any existing label-flipping attack can be post-processed via our proposed method to reduce the number of label flips required while preserving the intended poisoning effect. Empirical results demonstrate that this cost-minimization post-processing can significantly reduce poisoning costs over baselines, particularly when the reward model's feature dimension is small relative to the dataset size. These findings highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in RLHF/DPO pipelines and provide tools to evaluate their robustness against low-cost poisoning attacks.

TL;DR: TERLA introduces topological extensions for RL agents to defend networks of varying topology/size without retraining, using graph neural networks and fixed-size action spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep RL agents for cyber defense need retraining for different network topologies/sizes, making them impractical for real-world networks that change over time.

Method: Uses heterogeneous graph neural networks to create fixed-size latent embeddings of network states, coupled with reduced, interpretable action spaces. Applied to PPO agents in CAGE Challenge 4 environment.

Result: TERLA agents maintain defensive performance of vanilla PPO agents while improving action efficiency. Successfully deployed single agents to defend multiple network segments with different topologies/sizes.

Conclusion: TERLA provides generalizable cyber defense agents that work across varying network configurations without retraining, bridging the sim-to-real gap for autonomous network defense.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning for autonomous cyber defence have resulted in agents that can successfully defend simulated computer networks against cyber-attacks. However, many of these agents would need retraining to defend networks with differing topology or size, making them poorly suited to real-world networks where topology and size can vary over time. In this research we introduce a novel set of Topological Extensions for Reinforcement Learning Agents (TERLA) that provide generalisability for the defence of networks with differing topology and size, without the need for retraining. Our approach involves the use of heterogeneous graph neural network layers to produce a fixed-size latent embedding representing the observed network state. This representation learning stage is coupled with a reduced, fixed-size, semantically meaningful and interpretable action space. We apply TERLA to a standard deep reinforcement learning Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) agent model, and to reduce the sim-to-real gap, conduct our research using Cyber Autonomy Gym for Experimentation (CAGE) Challenge 4. This Cyber Operations Research Gym environment has many of the features of a real-world network, such as realistic Intrusion Detection System (IDS) events and multiple agents defending network segments of differing topology and size. TERLA agents retain the defensive performance of vanilla PPO agents whilst showing improved action efficiency. Generalisability has been demonstrated by showing that all TERLA agents have the same network-agnostic neural network architecture, and by deploying a single TERLA agent multiple times to defend network segments with differing topology and size, showing improved defensive performance and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance has been well-studied in single-view scenarios but remains challenging in multi-view contexts, especially for long-tailed classification where trustworthy solutions are scarce.

Method: Proposes TMLC with two key components: 1) Group consensus opinion aggregation inspired by Social Identity Theory, and 2) Uncertainty-guided pseudo-data generation using a novel distance metric to adapt SMOTE for multi-view scenarios.

Result: Extensive experiments on long-tailed multi-view datasets demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: TMLC effectively mitigates class imbalance effects in multi-view long-tailed classification through trustworthy opinion aggregation and high-quality pseudo-data generation.

Abstract: Class imbalance has been extensively studied in single-view scenarios; however, addressing this challenge in multi-view contexts remains an open problem, with even scarcer research focusing on trustworthy solutions. In this paper, we tackle a particularly challenging class imbalance problem in multi-view scenarios: long-tailed classification. We propose TMLC, a Trusted Multi-view Long-tailed Classification framework, which makes contributions on two critical aspects: opinion aggregation and pseudo-data generation. Specifically, inspired by Social Identity Theory, we design a group consensus opinion aggregation mechanism that guides decision making toward the direction favored by the majority of the group. In terms of pseudo-data generation, we introduce a novel distance metric to adapt SMOTE for multi-view scenarios and develop an uncertainty-guided data generation module that produces high-quality pseudo-data, effectively mitigating the adverse effects of class imbalance. Extensive experiments on long-tailed multi-view datasets demonstrate that our model is capable of achieving superior performance. The code is released at https://github.com/cncq-tang/TMLC.

TL;DR: A chaining-based framework for estimating bounds on expected extreme values in Gaussian process regression, providing global and local uncertainty quantification without requiring specific input features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing uncertainty bounds in GPR require specific input features, rely on posterior estimates or hyperparameter tuning, lack robustness, and fail to capture global model behavior in expectation.

Method: Proposed chaining-based framework for estimating upper/lower bounds on expected extreme values over unseen data, with kernel-specific refinements for RBF and Matérn kernels, avoiding analytical relaxations for numerical tightness, and developing local uncertainty quantification using chaining geometry through partition diameters.

Result: Theoretical bounds are tighter than generic constructions for common kernels, experimental validation shows method outperforms existing approaches on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides robust uncertainty quantification for GPR without requiring specific input locations, offering improved tightness and adaptability to both global and local structures.

Abstract: Gaussian process regression (GPR) is a popular nonparametric Bayesian method that provides predictive uncertainty estimates and is widely used in safety-critical applications. While prior research has introduced various uncertainty bounds, most existing approaches require access to specific input features and rely on posterior mean and variance estimates or tuning hyperparameters. These limitations hinder robustness and fail to capture the model's global behavior in expectation. To address these limitations, we propose a chaining-based framework for estimating upper and lower bounds on the expected extreme values over unseen data, without requiring access to specific input locations. We provide kernel-specific refinements for commonly used kernels such as RBF and Matérn, in which our bounds are tighter than generic constructions. We further improve numerical tightness by avoiding analytical relaxations. In addition to global estimation, we also develop a novel method for local uncertainty quantification at specified inputs. This approach leverages chaining geometry through partition diameters, adapting to local structure without relying on posterior variance scaling. Our experimental results validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

TL;DR: Interlat enables direct transmission of LLM hidden states between agents for richer communication than natural language, improving collaborative problem-solving through latent space reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural language communication between LLM agents limits information depth due to downsampling rich internal states into discrete tokens, hindering collaborative capabilities.

Method: Proposes Interlat paradigm using LLM's last hidden states as mind representations for direct transmission, with additional compression via latent space reasoning.

Result: Outperforms fine-tuned CoT prompting and single-agent baselines, promotes exploratory behavior, enables genuine latent information utilization, and compression accelerates inference while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of entirely latent space inter-agent communication with significant potential for future research in agent collaboration.

Abstract: While natural language is the de facto communication medium for LLM-based agents, it presents a fundamental constraint. The process of downsampling rich, internal latent states into discrete tokens inherently limits the depth and nuance of information that can be transmitted, thereby hindering collaborative problem-solving. Inspired by human mind-reading, we propose Interlat (Inter-agent Latent Space Communication), a paradigm that leverages the last hidden states of an LLM as a representation of its mind for direct transmission (termed latent communication). An additional compression process further compresses latent communication via entirely latent space reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that Interlat outperforms both fine-tuned chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and single-agent baselines, promoting more exploratory behavior and enabling genuine utilization of latent information. Further compression not only substantially accelerates inference but also maintains competitive performance through an efficient information-preserving mechanism. We position this work as a feasibility study of entirely latent space inter-agent communication, and our results highlight its potential, offering valuable insights for future research.

TL;DR: GroupFS is an unsupervised feature selection method that jointly discovers latent feature groups and selects informative groups without predefined partitions or label supervision, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most unsupervised feature selection methods evaluate features individually, ignoring that informative signals often emerge from groups of related features (e.g., adjacent pixels, connected brain regions). Existing group-based methods rely on predefined partitions or supervision, limiting applicability.

Method: GroupFS is an end-to-end differentiable framework that enforces Laplacian smoothness on feature and sample graphs and applies group sparsity regularization to learn compact, structured representations while discovering latent feature groups.

Result: Across nine benchmarks spanning images, tabular data, and biological datasets, GroupFS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised feature selection methods in clustering and selects groups that align with meaningful patterns.

Conclusion: GroupFS effectively discovers and selects meaningful feature groups without supervision or predefined structure, demonstrating superior performance over individual feature evaluation methods in unsupervised learning scenarios.

Abstract: Unsupervised feature selection (FS) is essential for high-dimensional learning tasks where labels are not available. It helps reduce noise, improve generalization, and enhance interpretability. However, most existing unsupervised FS methods evaluate features in isolation, even though informative signals often emerge from groups of related features. For example, adjacent pixels, functionally connected brain regions, or correlated financial indicators tend to act together, making independent evaluation suboptimal. Although some methods attempt to capture group structure, they typically rely on predefined partitions or label supervision, limiting their applicability. We propose GroupFS, an end-to-end, fully differentiable framework that jointly discovers latent feature groups and selects the most informative groups among them, without relying on fixed a priori groups or label supervision. GroupFS enforces Laplacian smoothness on both feature and sample graphs and applies a group sparsity regularizer to learn a compact, structured representation. Across nine benchmarks spanning images, tabular data, and biological datasets, GroupFS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised FS in clustering and selects groups of features that align with meaningful patterns.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new method for building compact memory in continual learning that uses Hessian-matching and probabilistic PCA to find optimal memory for logistic regression, significantly outperforming Experience Replay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continual learning still underperforms batch training due to catastrophic forgetting, and no clear solution exists for building compact memory of essential past knowledge, even for shallow networks.

Method: Formulates memory search as Hessian-matching and uses probabilistic PCA to estimate optimal memory, building on Khan and Swaroop's [2021] existence proof of optimal memory for logistic regression models.

Result: Achieves 60% accuracy on Split-ImageNet vs 30% with Experience Replay (0.3% memory size), and 74% accuracy with 2% memory size, closing the gap to batch accuracy of 77.6%.

Conclusion: Opens a new direction for building compact memory that could be useful for future continual deep learning applications.

Abstract: Despite recent progress, continual learning still does not match the performance of batch training. To avoid catastrophic forgetting, we need to build compact memory of essential past knowledge, but no clear solution has yet emerged, even for shallow neural networks with just one or two layers. In this paper, we present a new method to build compact memory for logistic regression. Our method is based on a result by Khan and Swaroop [2021] who show the existence of optimal memory for such models. We formulate the search for the optimal memory as Hessian-matching and propose a probabilistic PCA method to estimate them. Our approach can drastically improve accuracy compared to Experience Replay. For instance, on Split-ImageNet, we get 60% accuracy compared to 30% obtained by replay with memory-size equivalent to 0.3% of the data size. Increasing the memory size to 2% further boosts the accuracy to 74%, closing the gap to the batch accuracy of 77.6% on this task.

### [146] [Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer for Stable Cross-Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09173)
*Guojian Wang,Quinson Hon,Xuyang Chen,Lin Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DFDT addresses cross-domain adaptation challenges for Decision Transformers by fusing target data with selectively filtered source fragments, using MMD and OT for alignment, and replacing RTG tokens with advantage-conditioned tokens to improve continuity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-domain shifts pose significant challenges for DT policies, where existing methods fail to maintain stitchability due to state misalignment, RTG incompatibility, and action jumps at trajectory junctions.

Method: Proposes DFDT with two-level data filtering (MMD for state-structure alignment, OT for action feasibility), feasibility-weighted fusion distribution, advantage-conditioned tokens instead of RTG, and Q-guided regularization.

Result: DFDT improves return and stability over strong baselines across gravity, kinematic, and morphology shifts on D4RL-style control tasks, with better token-stitching and sequence-semantics stability.

Conclusion: DFDT effectively addresses cross-domain adaptation challenges by restoring stitchability through data fusion and semantic continuity improvements, with theoretical bounds showing performance improvement as alignment measures tighten.

Abstract: Cross-domain shifts present a significant challenge for decision transformer (DT) policies. Existing cross-domain policy adaptation methods typically rely on a single simple filtering criterion to select source trajectory fragments and stitch them together. They match either state structure or action feasibility. However, the selected fragments still have poor stitchability: state structures can misalign, the return-to-go (RTG) becomes incomparable when the reward or horizon changes, and actions may jump at trajectory junctions. As a result, RTG tokens lose continuity, which compromises DT's inference ability. To tackle these challenges, we propose Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer (DFDT), a compact pipeline that restores stitchability. Particularly, DFDT fuses scarce target data with selectively trusted source fragments via a two-level data filter, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) mismatch for state-structure alignment, and optimal transport (OT) deviation for action feasibility. It then trains on a feasibility-weighted fusion distribution. Furthermore, DFDT replaces RTG tokens with advantage-conditioned tokens, which improves the continuity of the semantics in the token sequence. It also applies a $Q$-guided regularizer to suppress junction value and action jumps. Theoretically, we provide bounds that tie state value and policy performance gaps to the MMD-mismatch and OT-deviation measures, and show that the bounds tighten as these two measures shrink. We show that DFDT improves return and stability over strong offline RL and sequence-model baselines across gravity, kinematic, and morphology shifts on D4RL-style control tasks, and further corroborate these gains with token-stitching and sequence-semantics stability analyses.

*Michael A. Vladimir*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FSampler is a training-free, sampler-agnostic execution layer that accelerates diffusion sampling by reducing function evaluations through epsilon prediction and substitution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accelerate diffusion sampling by reducing the number of function evaluations (NFE) without modifying sampler formulas or requiring retraining.

Method: Maintains history of denoising signals, extrapolates next epsilon using finite difference predictors (2nd-4th order), validates predictions, uses learning stabilizer for drift correction, and implements protective mechanisms like windows and periodic anchors.

Result: Reduces time by 8-22% and model calls by 15-25% at high fidelity (SSIM 0.95-0.99), with aggressive settings reaching 45-50% fewer model calls at lower fidelity (SSIM 0.73-0.74).

Conclusion: FSampler effectively accelerates diffusion sampling across various samplers while maintaining fidelity, demonstrating practical speed improvements without algorithm modifications.

Abstract: FSampler is a training free, sampler agnostic execution layer that accelerates diffusion sampling by reducing the number of function evaluations (NFE). FSampler maintains a short history of denoising signals (epsilon) from recent real model calls and extrapolates the next epsilon using finite difference predictors at second order, third order, or fourth order, falling back to lower order when history is insufficient. On selected steps the predicted epsilon substitutes the model call while keeping each sampler's update rule unchanged. Predicted epsilons are validated for finiteness and magnitude; a learning stabilizer rescales predictions on skipped steps to correct drift, and an optional gradient estimation stabilizer compensates local curvature. Protected windows, periodic anchors, and a cap on consecutive skips bound deviation over the trajectory. Operating at the sampler level, FSampler integrates with Euler/DDIM, DPM++ 2M/2S, LMS/AB2, and RES family exponential multistep methods and drops into standard workflows. FLUX.1 dev, Qwen Image, and Wan 2.2, FSampler reduces time by 8 to 22% and model calls by 15 to 25% at high fidelity (Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) 0.95 to 0.99), without altering sampler formulas. With an aggressive adaptive gate, reductions can reach 45 to 50% fewer model calls at lower fidelity (SSIM 0.73 to 0.74).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IPBT is a PBT variant that automatically adjusts the hyperparameter update frequency via restarts and time-varying Bayesian optimization, outperforming previous methods on image classification and RL tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The number of steps between hyperparameter updates in PBT methods is a critical meta-hyperparameter that significantly affects performance, but no efficient method exists for setting its value automatically.

Method: Uses iterated restarts that reuse weight information task-agnostically and leverages time-varying Bayesian optimization to reinitialize hyperparameters.

Result: Evaluation on 8 image classification and reinforcement learning tasks shows IPBT matches or outperforms 5 previous PBT variants and other HPO algorithms without requiring budget increases or hyperparameter changes.

Conclusion: IPBT successfully automates the tuning of the critical update frequency hyperparameter in PBT methods, providing a robust and efficient HPO solution.

Abstract: Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) can lift the burden of tuning hyperparameters (HPs) of neural networks. HPO algorithms from the Population Based Training (PBT) family are efficient thanks to dynamically adjusting HPs every few steps of the weight optimization. Recent results indicate that the number of steps between HP updates is an important meta-HP of all PBT variants that can substantially affect their performance. Yet, no method or intuition is available for efficiently setting its value. We introduce Iterated Population Based Training (IPBT), a novel PBT variant that automatically adjusts this HP via restarts that reuse weight information in a task-agnostic way and leverage time-varying Bayesian optimization to reinitialize HPs. Evaluation on 8 image classification and reinforcement learning tasks shows that, on average, our algorithm matches or outperforms 5 previous PBT variants and other HPO algorithms (random search, ASHA, SMAC3), without requiring a budget increase or any changes to its HPs.

*Philipp Dingfelder,Christian Riess*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses quality issues in AI-generated text detection datasets, specifically identifying simple patterns in DetectRL benchmark data that enable spoofing attacks on detectors, and proposes data cleansing methods to improve robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To prevent illicit use of large language models, reliable AI-generated text detectors are needed, but current benchmark datasets like DetectRL contain quality issues with simple patterns that make detectors vulnerable to spoofing attacks.

Method: The authors reprocessed the DetectRL dataset using several cleansing operations to remove problematic patterns such as introductory phrases like "Sure! Here is the academic article abstract:" and LLM task rejections.

Result: Experiments showed that data cleansing makes direct spoofing attacks on trained detectors more difficult, improving the robustness of AI-generated text detection systems.

Conclusion: Data quality is crucial for training reliable AI-generated text detectors, and the proposed cleansing approach effectively mitigates vulnerability to spoofing attacks. The reprocessed dataset is made publicly available.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for many applications. To prevent illicit use, it is desirable to be able to detect AI-generated text. Training and evaluation of such detectors critically depend on suitable benchmark datasets. Several groups took on the tedious work of collecting, curating, and publishing large and diverse datasets for this task. However, it remains an open challenge to ensure high quality in all relevant aspects of such a dataset. For example, the DetectRL benchmark exhibits relatively simple patterns of AI-generation in 98.5% of the Claude-LLM data. These patterns may include introductory words such as "Sure! Here is the academic article abstract:", or instances where the LLM rejects the prompted task. In this work, we demonstrate that detectors trained on such data use such patterns as shortcuts, which facilitates spoofing attacks on the trained detectors. We consequently reprocessed the DetectRL dataset with several cleansing operations. Experiments show that such data cleansing makes direct attacks more difficult. The reprocessed dataset is publicly available.

TL;DR: CoCo-MILP introduces contrastive learning and competitive GNNs to better align with MILP structure, significantly outperforming existing methods by modeling variable contrast and constraint competition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN-based MILP solvers misalign with MILP structure at two levels: BCE loss treats variables independently ignoring relative priority, and standard GNN message passing smooths representations missing competitive relationships within constraints.

Method: Proposes CoCo-MILP with Inter-Variable Contrastive Loss (VCL) to maximize embedding margin between variables assigned one vs zero, and Intra-Constraint Competitive GNN layer that differentiates representations of competing variables within constraints.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing learning-based approaches, reducing solution gap by up to 68.12% compared to traditional solvers on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling inter-variable contrast and intra-constraint competition better captures MILP structure and leads to superior solution prediction performance.

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a cornerstone of combinatorial optimization, yet solving large-scale instances remains a significant computational challenge. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promise in accelerating MILP solvers by predicting high-quality solutions. However, we identify that existing methods misalign with the intrinsic structure of MILP problems at two levels. At the leaning objective level, the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss treats variables independently, neglecting their relative priority and yielding plausible logits. At the model architecture level, standard GNN message passing inherently smooths the representations across variables, missing the natural competitive relationships within constraints. To address these challenges, we propose CoCo-MILP, which explicitly models inter-variable Contrast and intra-constraint Competition for advanced MILP solution prediction. At the objective level, CoCo-MILP introduces the Inter-Variable Contrastive Loss (VCL), which explicitly maximizes the embedding margin between variables assigned one versus zero. At the architectural level, we design an Intra-Constraint Competitive GNN layer that, instead of homogenizing features, learns to differentiate representations of competing variables within a constraint, capturing their exclusionary nature. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that CoCo-MILP significantly outperforms existing learning-based approaches, reducing the solution gap by up to 68.12% compared to traditional solvers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SCMax is a parameter-free clustering framework that uses self-supervised consensus maximization to automatically determine the optimal number of clusters through hierarchical agglomerative clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing clustering methods require hyperparameters like the number of clusters, limiting their real-world applicability. There's a need for fully parameter-free clustering approaches.

Method: Performs hierarchical agglomerative clustering with integrated cluster evaluation. Creates structure-aware data representations through self-supervised learning guided by current clustering structure, and uses nearest neighbor consensus score to measure agreement between original and self-supervised representations.

Result: Extensive experiments show SCMax outperforms existing clustering approaches designed for scenarios with unknown number of clusters.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the challenge of parameter-free clustering by using self-supervised consensus maximization to automatically determine optimal clustering structure.

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental task in unsupervised learning, but most existing methods heavily rely on hyperparameters such as the number of clusters or other sensitive settings, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this long-standing challenge, we propose a novel and fully parameter-free clustering framework via Self-supervised Consensus Maximization, named SCMax. Our framework performs hierarchical agglomerative clustering and cluster evaluation in a single, integrated process. At each step of agglomeration, it creates a new, structure-aware data representation through a self-supervised learning task guided by the current clustering structure. We then introduce a nearest neighbor consensus score, which measures the agreement between the nearest neighbor-based merge decisions suggested by the original representation and the self-supervised one. The moment at which consensus maximization occurs can serve as a criterion for determining the optimal number of clusters. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing clustering approaches designed for scenarios with an unknown number of clusters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models generate realistic protein structures but lack ability to steer outcomes toward specific functional objectives like binding affinity or sequence composition.

Method: Couples Feynman-Kac steering framework with diffusion-based structure generation, using rewards computed on ProteinMPNN-refined models and all-atom relaxation for simultaneous sequence/structure optimization.

Result: Consistently improves predicted interface energetics in binder design across diverse targets with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: FK control generalizes diffusion-based protein design to arbitrary, non-differentiable objectives, providing a unified framework for guided molecular generation.

Abstract: Diffusion-based models have recently enabled the generation of realistic and diverse protein structures, yet they remain limited in their ability to steer outcomes toward specific functional or biochemical objectives, such as binding affinity or sequence composition. Here we extend the Feynman-Kac (FK) steering framework, an inference-time control approach, to diffusion-based protein design. By coupling FK steering with structure generation, the method guides sampling toward desirable structural or energetic features while maintaining the diversity of the underlying diffusion process. To enable simultaneous generation of both sequence and structure properties, rewards are computed on models refined through ProteinMPNN and all-atom relaxation. Applied to binder design, FK steering consistently improves predicted interface energetics across diverse targets with minimal computational overhead. More broadly, this work demonstrates that inference-time FK control generalizes diffusion-based protein design to arbitrary, non-differentiable, and reward-agnostic objectives, providing a unified and model-independent framework for guided molecular generation.

TL;DR: PlanB&B is a model-based RL agent that uses learned B&B dynamics to improve branching strategies, outperforming previous RL methods on MILP benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond static heuristics in MILP solving by leveraging RL advancements from board games, specifically using learned environment models to guide branching decisions in branch-and-bound algorithms.

Method: Proposed PlanB&B, a model-based reinforcement learning agent that learns an internal model of B&B dynamics and uses it to discover improved branching strategies through planning.

Result: The MBRL branching agent outperformed previous state-of-the-art RL methods across four standard MILP benchmarks in computational experiments.

Conclusion: Model-based RL with learned B&B dynamics can effectively discover superior branching strategies for MILP problems, advancing beyond traditional static heuristics and previous RL approaches.

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) lies at the core of many real-world combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, traditionally solved by branch-and-bound (B&B). A key driver influencing B&B solvers efficiency is the variable selection heuristic that guides branching decisions. Looking to move beyond static, hand-crafted heuristics, recent work has explored adapting traditional reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to the B&B setting, aiming to learn branching strategies tailored to specific MILP distributions. In parallel, RL agents have achieved remarkable success in board games, a very specific type of combinatorial problems, by leveraging environment simulators to plan via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Building on these developments, we introduce Plan-and-Branch-and-Bound (PlanB&B), a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) agent that leverages a learned internal model of the B&B dynamics to discover improved branching strategies. Computational experiments empirically validate our approach, with our MBRL branching agent outperforming previous state-of-the-art RL methods across four standard MILP benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A distributed GNN framework for combinatorial optimization that partitions large graphs into subgraphs, trains them individually, and uses RL to handle cross-node constraints, achieving better scalability and performance than state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN methods for combinatorial optimization suffer from limited accuracy on complex graphs and poor scalability due to memory constraints when loading entire graphs and embeddings.

Method: 1) Partition large graphs into smaller subgraphs, 2) Fully train individual subgraphs for local optimization, 3) Use reinforcement learning with GNN outputs to learn cross-node constraints.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in solution quality and computational efficiency on both real social networks (Facebook, Youtube) and synthetic complex graphs, with validated scalability on large instances.

Conclusion: The proposed distributed GNN framework effectively addresses scalability and accuracy limitations in combinatorial optimization, making it suitable for large-scale applications.

Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely applied in tackling combinatorial optimization problems. However, existing methods still suffer from limited accuracy when addressing that on complex graphs and exhibit poor scalability, since full training requires loading the whole adjacent matrix and all embeddings at a time, the it may results in out of memory of a single machine. This limitation significantly restricts their applicability to large-scale scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a distributed GNN-based training framework for combinatorial optimization. In details, firstly, large graph is partition into several small subgraphs. Then the individual subgraphs are full trained, providing a foundation for efficient local optimization. Finally, reinforcement learning (RL) are employed to take actions according to GNN output, to make sure the restrictions between cross nodes can be learned. Extensive experiments are conducted on both real large-scale social network datasets (e.g., Facebook, Youtube) and synthetically generated high-complexity graphs, which demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both solution quality and computational efficiency. Moreover, the experiments on large graph instances also validate the scalability of the model.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when and why predictive coding forms structured internal representations that mirror environmental latent structure, as the conditions for such emergence remain unclear.

Method: Used deep networks with multi-step prediction horizons in minimal abstract settings, then extended to nonlinear networks and complex datasets including piecewise linear functions, MNIST, multiple latent states, and higher dimensional geometries.

Result: Sufficiently deep networks trained with multi-step prediction horizons consistently recover the underlying latent structure across various settings.

Conclusion: The work provides principled understanding of when predictive coding induces structured representations, bridging empirical observations with theoretical foundations through OLS estimator structure and learning dynamics biases.

Abstract: Predictive coding is a framework for understanding the formation of low-dimensional internal representations mirroring the environment's latent structure. The conditions under which such representations emerge remain unclear. In this work, we investigate how the prediction horizon and network depth shape the solutions of predictive coding tasks. Using a minimal abstract setting inspired by prior work, we show empirically and theoretically that sufficiently deep networks trained with multi-step prediction horizons consistently recover the underlying latent structure, a phenomenon explained through the Ordinary Least Squares estimator structure and biases in learning dynamics. We then extend these insights to nonlinear networks and complex datasets, including piecewise linear functions, MNIST, multiple latent states and higher dimensional state geometries. Our results provide a principled understanding of when and why predictive coding induces structured representations, bridging the gap between empirical observations and theoretical foundations.

TL;DR: Proposes Dual-Facet Attack (DFA) that simultaneously degrades both utility and fairness in federated learning, and introduces GuardFed defense framework that uses dual-perspective trust scoring to counter these attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning is vulnerable to adversarial attacks, but existing research focuses on attacks targeting either utility or fairness separately, leaving simultaneous attacks unexplored.

Method: Introduced two DFA variants (Synchronous and Split) for different collusion scenarios. Proposed GuardFed defense with fairness-aware reference model, synthetic data augmentation, and dual-perspective trust scoring for client updates.

Result: Existing robust FL defenses fail against DFAs. GuardFed consistently preserves accuracy and fairness under diverse non-IID and adversarial conditions, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: DFAs pose significant threats to FL systems, and GuardFed provides an effective defense mechanism that maintains both utility and fairness through adaptive trust evaluation.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative model training but remains vulnerable to adversarial behaviors that compromise model utility or fairness across sensitive groups. While extensive studies have examined attacks targeting either objective, strategies that simultaneously degrade both utility and fairness remain largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Dual-Facet Attack (DFA), a novel threat model that concurrently undermines predictive accuracy and group fairness. Two variants, Synchronous DFA (S-DFA) and Split DFA (Sp-DFA), are further proposed to capture distinct real-world collusion scenarios. Experimental results show that existing robust FL defenses, including hybrid aggregation schemes, fail to resist DFAs effectively. To counter these threats, we propose GuardFed, a self-adaptive defense framework that maintains a fairness-aware reference model using a small amount of clean server data augmented with synthetic samples. In each training round, GuardFed computes a dual-perspective trust score for every client by jointly evaluating its utility deviation and fairness degradation, thereby enabling selective aggregation of trustworthy updates. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that GuardFed consistently preserves both accuracy and fairness under diverse non-IID and adversarial conditions, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared with existing robust FL methods.

TL;DR: RENTT algorithm transforms neural networks into exact equivalent decision trees for faithful explanations, overcoming limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks lack transparency and trustworthiness due to their black-box nature, and existing explainable AI methods often provide unfaithful explanations that don't align with the model's actual decision logic.

Method: Developed RENTT (Runtime Efficient Network to Tree Transformation) algorithm that computes exact equivalent decision tree representations of neural networks, supporting CNNs, RNNs, non-ReLU activations, and bias terms with rigorous proofs.

Result: RENTT achieves computational efficiency and scalability, successfully uncovering ground truth explanations compared to conventional approximation methods like LIME and SHAP. Provides feature importance analysis at global, regional, and local levels.

Conclusion: RENTT enables faithful and exact explanations of neural network decisions through equivalent decision tree transformations, addressing the trustworthiness gap in neural network applications.

Abstract: Although neural networks are a powerful tool, their widespread use is hindered by the opacity of their decisions and their black-box nature, which result in a lack of trustworthiness. To alleviate this problem, methods in the field of explainable Artificial Intelligence try to unveil how such automated decisions are made. But explainable AI methods are often plagued by missing faithfulness/correctness, meaning that they sometimes provide explanations that do not align with the neural network's decision and logic. Recently, transformations to decision trees have been proposed to overcome such problems. Unfortunately, they typically lack exactness, scalability, or interpretability as the size of the neural network grows. Thus, we generalize these previous results, especially by considering convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, non-ReLU activation functions, and bias terms. Our findings are accompanied by rigorous proofs and we present a novel algorithm RENTT (Runtime Efficient Network to Tree Transformation) designed to compute an exact equivalent decision tree representation of neural networks in a manner that is both runtime and memory efficient. The resulting decision trees are multivariate and thus, possibly too complex to understand. To alleviate this problem, we also provide a method to calculate the ground truth feature importance for neural networks via the equivalent decision trees - for entire models (global), specific input regions (regional), or single decisions (local). All theoretical results are supported by detailed numerical experiments that emphasize two key aspects: the computational efficiency and scalability of our algorithm, and that only RENTT succeeds in uncovering ground truth explanations compared to conventional approximation methods like LIME and SHAP.

TL;DR: Proposes a tensor circuit neural network (TCNN) combining tensor neural networks with quantum circuit models to achieve better generalization and robustness with low complexity, featuring complex number operations and information fusion layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of reducing neural network complexity while maintaining generalization ability and robustness, overcoming limitations of existing quantum-inspired and hybrid tensor networks.

Method: Uses tensor circuit neural network with activation operations and parallelism in complex number field, plus an information fusion layer to merge features from real and imaginary parameters.

Result: TCNN achieves 2%-3% higher average accuracy than state-of-the-art models on various datasets, maintains learning capability under noise attacks, and prevents gradient explosion.

Conclusion: TCNN successfully combines tensor networks with circuit models to achieve superior generalization, robustness, and efficiency with comparable parameter count and runtime.

Abstract: It is challenging to reduce the complexity of neural networks while maintaining their generalization ability and robustness, especially for practical applications. Conventional solutions for this problem incorporate quantum-inspired neural networks with Kronecker products and hybrid tensor neural networks with MPO factorization and fully-connected layers. Nonetheless, the generalization power and robustness of the fully-connected layers are not as outstanding as circuit models in quantum computing. In this paper, we propose a novel tensor circuit neural network (TCNN) that takes advantage of the characteristics of tensor neural networks and residual circuit models to achieve generalization ability and robustness with low complexity. The proposed activation operation and parallelism of the circuit in complex number field improves its non-linearity and efficiency for feature learning. Moreover, since the feature information exists in the parameters in both the real and imaginary parts in TCNN, an information fusion layer is proposed for merging features stored in those parameters to enhance the generalization capability. Experimental results confirm that TCNN showcases more outstanding generalization and robustness with its average accuracies on various datasets 2\%-3\% higher than those of the state-of-the-art compared models. More significantly, while other models fail to learn features under noise parameter attacking, TCNN still showcases prominent learning capability owing to its ability to prevent gradient explosion. Furthermore, it is comparable to the compared models on the number of trainable parameters and the CPU running time. An ablation study also indicates the advantage of the activation operation, the parallelism architecture and the information fusion layer.

Motivation: FFN activations have become the critical bottleneck for memory overhead in LLMs, especially when FlashAttention is implemented, creating substantial challenges for both training and inference despite existing parameter and optimizer state reduction methods.

Method: Introduces Mixture-of-Channels (MoC) FFN architecture that uses SwiGLU's native gating mechanism to selectively activate only the Top-K most relevant channels per token, reducing activation memory during pre-training and improving inference efficiency through partial weight loading into GPU SRAM.

Result: Extensive experiments show MoC delivers significant memory savings and throughput gains while maintaining competitive model performance compared to standard FFN architectures.

Conclusion: MoC effectively addresses the activation memory bottleneck in LLMs through selective channel activation, providing a practical solution for memory-efficient training and inference without compromising model quality.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across diverse artificial intelligence tasks, driven by scaling laws that correlate model size and training data with performance improvements. However, this scaling paradigm incurs substantial memory overhead, creating significant challenges for both training and inference. While existing research has primarily addressed parameter and optimizer state memory reduction, activation memory-particularly from feed-forward networks (FFNs)-has become the critical bottleneck, especially when FlashAttention is implemented. In this work, we conduct a detailed memory profiling of LLMs and identify FFN activations as the predominant source to activation memory overhead. Motivated by this, we introduce Mixture-of-Channels (MoC), a novel FFN architecture that selectively activates only the Top-K most relevant channels per token determined by SwiGLU's native gating mechanism. MoC substantially reduces activation memory during pre-training and improves inference efficiency by reducing memory access through partial weight loading into GPU SRAM. Extensive experiments validate that MoC delivers significant memory savings and throughput gains while maintaining competitive model performance.

Motivation: Classical RMABs assume fixed dynamics, which is often violated in real-world nonstationary environments where system behavior changes over time due to unobserved latent states.

Method: Introduces MARBLE framework with latent Markov environment states, proposes Markov-Averaged Indexability criterion, and develops synchronous Q-learning with Whittle Indices (QWI) algorithm.

Result: Proves that QWI converges almost surely to optimal Q-function and Whittle indices under MAI criterion, and validates on digital twin recommender system showing successful adaptation to shifting latent states.

Conclusion: MARBLE provides a principled framework for nonstationary RMABs with theoretical guarantees, enabling effective decision-making in environments with unobserved regime changes.

Abstract: Restless Multi-Armed Bandits (RMABs) are powerful models for decision-making under uncertainty, yet classical formulations typically assume fixed dynamics, an assumption often violated in nonstationary environments. We introduce MARBLE (Multi-Armed Restless Bandits in a Latent Markovian Environment), which augments RMABs with a latent Markov state that induces nonstationary behavior. In MARBLE, each arm evolves according to a latent environment state that switches over time, making policy learning substantially more challenging. We further introduce the Markov-Averaged Indexability (MAI) criterion as a relaxed indexability assumption and prove that, despite unobserved regime switches, under the MAI criterion, synchronous Q-learning with Whittle Indices (QWI) converges almost surely to the optimal Q-function and the corresponding Whittle indices. We validate MARBLE on a calibrated simulator-embedded (digital twin) recommender system, where QWI consistently adapts to a shifting latent state and converges to an optimal policy, empirically corroborating our theoretical findings.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a formal definition for feature attribution in AI model explanations and proposes DFAX, a novel model-agnostic method that explains predictions based directly on the data distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of complex black-box AI models has created a need for explanation techniques, but the field lacks formal problem definitions for feature attribution methods.

Method: The paper proposes Distributional Feature Attribution eXplanations (DFAX), a model-agnostic feature attribution method that explains classifier predictions directly based on the underlying data distribution.

Result: Extensive experiments show that DFAX is more effective and efficient than state-of-the-art baselines, and analysis reveals many existing methods fail to meet the proposed formal criteria.

Conclusion: DFAX addresses limitations in existing feature attribution methods by providing formal foundations and demonstrating superior performance through direct data distribution-based explanations.

Abstract: The proliferation of complex, black-box AI models has intensified the need for techniques that can explain their decisions. Feature attribution methods have become a popular solution for providing post-hoc explanations, yet the field has historically lacked a formal problem definition. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a formal definition for the problem of feature attribution, which stipulates that explanations be supported by an underlying probability distribution represented by the given dataset. Our analysis reveals that many existing model-agnostic methods fail to meet this criterion, while even those that do often possess other limitations. To overcome these challenges, we propose Distributional Feature Attribution eXplanations (DFAX), a novel, model-agnostic method for feature attribution. DFAX is the first feature attribution method to explain classifier predictions directly based on the data distribution. We show through extensive experiments that DFAX is more effective and efficient than state-of-the-art baselines.

*Alexander Nadel,Ron Wettenstein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WOODELF is a new SHAP algorithm that computes Background SHAP values in linear time using a unified framework combining decision trees, game theory, and Boolean logic, achieving significant speedups over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SHAP calculation methods for decision tree ensembles have computational limitations, with Background SHAP being particularly slow despite its theoretical advantages over Path-Dependent SHAP.

Method: WOODELF constructs pseudo-Boolean formulas that capture feature values, decision tree structure, and background dataset, then leverages this representation to compute various game-theoretic values including Background SHAP in linear time.

Result: WOODELF achieved 16x speedup on CPU (162 seconds vs 44 minutes) and 165x speedup on GPU (16 seconds vs 44 minutes) for computing Background SHAP values on a large dataset with 3M rows, 5M background samples, and 127 features.

Conclusion: WOODELF provides an efficient, hardware-agnostic solution for computing SHAP and other game-theoretic values, enabling large-scale interpretability analysis with dramatic performance improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is a key tool for interpreting decision tree ensembles by assigning contribution values to features. It is widely used in finance, advertising, medicine, and other domains. Two main approaches to SHAP calculation exist: Path-Dependent SHAP, which leverages the tree structure for efficiency, and Background SHAP, which uses a background dataset to estimate feature distributions.
  We introduce WOODELF, a SHAP algorithm that integrates decision trees, game theory, and Boolean logic into a unified framework. For each consumer, WOODELF constructs a pseudo-Boolean formula that captures their feature values, the structure of the decision tree ensemble, and the entire background dataset. It then leverages this representation to compute Background SHAP in linear time. WOODELF can also compute Path-Dependent SHAP, Shapley interaction values, Banzhaf values, and Banzhaf interaction values.
  WOODELF is designed to run efficiently on CPU and GPU hardware alike. Available via the WOODELF Python package, it is implemented using NumPy, SciPy, and CuPy without relying on custom C++ or CUDA code. This design enables fast performance and seamless integration into existing frameworks, supporting large-scale computation of SHAP and other game-theoretic values in practice.
  For example, on a dataset with 3,000,000 rows, 5,000,000 background samples, and 127 features, WOODELF computed all Background Shapley values in 162 seconds on CPU and 16 seconds on GPU - compared to 44 minutes required by the best method on any hardware platform, representing 16x and 165x speedups, respectively.

*Jiajie Su,Zihan Nan,Yunshan Ma,Xiaobo Xia,Xiaohua Feng,Weiming Liu,Xiaolin Zheng,Chaochao Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CREAT is a constrained reinforcement learning attack method that subtly contaminates user interaction sequences in sequential recommenders to induce targeted mispredictions while maintaining stealthiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing profile pollution attacks on sequential recommenders have limitations: over-reliance on sequence horizon impact restricts fine-grained perturbations, and holistic modifications cause detectable distribution shifts.

Method: A constrained reinforcement driven attack (CREAT) using bi-level optimization with multi-reward reinforcement learning. Features Pattern Balanced Rewarding Policy (pattern inversion + distribution consistency rewards via unbalanced co-optimal transport) and Constrained Group Relative Reinforcement Learning (dynamic barrier constraints + group-shared experience replay).

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CREAT in achieving targeted pollution with minimal detectability.

Conclusion: CREAT successfully addresses the limitations of previous PPA methods by balancing adversarial efficacy and stealthiness through constrained reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Sequential Recommenders, which exploit dynamic user intents through interaction sequences, is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While existing attacks primarily rely on data poisoning, they require large-scale user access or fake profiles thus lacking practicality. In this paper, we focus on the Profile Pollution Attack that subtly contaminates partial user interactions to induce targeted mispredictions. Previous PPA methods suffer from two limitations, i.e., i) over-reliance on sequence horizon impact restricts fine-grained perturbations on item transitions, and ii) holistic modifications cause detectable distribution shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a constrained reinforcement driven attack CREAT that synergizes a bi-level optimization framework with multi-reward reinforcement learning to balance adversarial efficacy and stealthiness. We first develop a Pattern Balanced Rewarding Policy, which integrates pattern inversion rewards to invert critical patterns and distribution consistency rewards to minimize detectable shifts via unbalanced co-optimal transport. Then we employ a Constrained Group Relative Reinforcement Learning paradigm, enabling step-wise perturbations through dynamic barrier constraints and group-shared experience replay, achieving targeted pollution with minimal detectability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CREAT.

TL;DR: Using conditional diffusion models to interpolate missing sinogram data in PET imaging, enabling cost-efficient and patient-friendly scanner geometries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PET imaging needs methods for unconstrained detector layouts (walk-through designs, long-axial rings) that create severely undersampled sinograms due to gaps and open sides, instead of constraining hardware to complete cylinders.

Method: Treat missing lines-of-responses as learnable prior using conditional diffusion models to interpolate sparsely sampled sinograms.

Result: Not specified in abstract.

Conclusion: This approach paves the way for novel, cost-efficient, and patient-friendly PET geometries in real clinical settings.

Abstract: Accurate PET imaging increasingly requires methods that support unconstrained detector layouts from walk-through designs to long-axial rings where gaps and open sides lead to severely undersampled sinograms. Instead of constraining the hardware to form complete cylinders, we propose treating the missing lines-of-responses as a learnable prior. Data-driven approaches, particularly generative models, offer a promising pathway to recover this missing information. In this work, we explore the use of conditional diffusion models to interpolate sparsely sampled sinograms, paving the way for novel, cost-efficient, and patient-friendly PET geometries in real clinical settings.

TL;DR: CallosumNet is a novel spatio-temporal graph unlearning framework that achieves complete data removal with minimal performance loss, inspired by the corpus callosum brain structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stringent privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA) require complete unlearning of unauthorized data from spatio-temporal graphs, but existing methods designed for static graphs are inefficient and costly for spatio-temporal data where information diffuses globally across spatial and temporal dimensions.

Method: Proposes CallosumNet with two key techniques: (1) Enhanced Subgraph Construction (ESC) that adaptively constructs localized subgraphs using biologically-inspired virtual ganglions, and (2) Global Ganglion Bridging (GGB) that reconstructs global spatio-temporal dependencies from localized subgraphs to restore full graph representation.

Result: Empirical results on four real-world datasets show CallosumNet achieves complete unlearning with only 1%-2% relative MAE loss compared to the gold model, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: CallosumNet provides an effective solution for complete spatio-temporal graph unlearning that addresses privacy compliance requirements while maintaining model performance, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of both proposed techniques.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal graphs are widely used in modeling complex dynamic processes such as traffic forecasting, molecular dynamics, and healthcare monitoring. Recently, stringent privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA have introduced significant new challenges for existing spatio-temporal graph models, requiring complete unlearning of unauthorized data. Since each node in a spatio-temporal graph diffuses information globally across both spatial and temporal dimensions, existing unlearning methods primarily designed for static graphs and localized data removal cannot efficiently erase a single node without incurring costs nearly equivalent to full model retraining. Therefore, an effective approach for complete spatio-temporal graph unlearning is a pressing need. To address this, we propose CallosumNet, a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal graph unlearning framework inspired by the corpus callosum structure that facilitates communication between the brain's two hemispheres. CallosumNet incorporates two novel techniques: (1) Enhanced Subgraph Construction (ESC), which adaptively constructs multiple localized subgraphs based on several factors, including biologically-inspired virtual ganglions; and (2) Global Ganglion Bridging (GGB), which reconstructs global spatio-temporal dependencies from these localized subgraphs, effectively restoring the full graph representation. Empirical results on four diverse real-world datasets show that CallosumNet achieves complete unlearning with only 1%-2% relative MAE loss compared to the gold model, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness of both proposed techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in graph machine learning under personalization and privacy constraints, particularly for sparse graphs in low-resource settings.

Method: Combines data augmentation for sparse graphs, prompt/instruction tuning to adapt foundation models, in-context learning for graph reasoning, and Bayesian variational objective for personalized federated learning with cross-modal regularization.

Result: Supports node classification and link prediction in low-resource settings, with applications to knowledge graph completion, recommendation systems, and citation/product graphs.

Conclusion: Provides a comprehensive framework for LLM-assisted graph ML with convergence guarantees, privacy protection, and evaluation considerations for benchmarking.

Abstract: We propose a method that uses large language models to assist graph machine learning under personalization and privacy constraints. The approach combines data augmentation for sparse graphs, prompt and instruction tuning to adapt foundation models to graph tasks, and in-context learning to supply few-shot graph reasoning signals. These signals parameterize a Dynamic UMAP manifold of client-specific graph embeddings inside a Bayesian variational objective for personalized federated learning. The method supports node classification and link prediction in low-resource settings and aligns language model latent representations with graph structure via a cross-modal regularizer. We outline a convergence argument for the variational aggregation procedure, describe a differential privacy threat model based on a moments accountant, and present applications to knowledge graph completion, recommendation-style link prediction, and citation and product graphs. We also discuss evaluation considerations for benchmarking LLM-assisted graph machine learning.

TL;DR: AGT framework provides unified certification for training data perturbations including adversarial poisoning, data removal, and differential privacy scenarios by bounding parameter-space reachable sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training data perturbation certification is under-explored compared to inference-time robustness, but critical for adversarial poisoning, machine unlearning, and differential privacy applications.

Method: Abstract Gradient Training (AGT) bounds the reachable set of model parameters during first-order optimization to certify robustness against training data perturbations.

Result: AGT establishes provable parameter-space bounds that formally analyze model behavior under various training data perturbations including bounded changes, removals, and additions.

Conclusion: AGT provides a unified framework for certifying training data robustness across multiple critical scenarios where traditional inference-time certification methods don't apply.

Abstract: The impact of inference-time data perturbation (e.g., adversarial attacks) has been extensively studied in machine learning, leading to well-established certification techniques for adversarial robustness. In contrast, certifying models against training data perturbations remains a relatively under-explored area. These perturbations can arise in three critical contexts: adversarial data poisoning, where an adversary manipulates training samples to corrupt model performance; machine unlearning, which requires certifying model behavior under the removal of specific training data; and differential privacy, where guarantees must be given with respect to substituting individual data points. This work introduces Abstract Gradient Training (AGT), a unified framework for certifying robustness of a given model and training procedure to training data perturbations, including bounded perturbations, the removal of data points, and the addition of new samples. By bounding the reachable set of parameters, i.e., establishing provable parameter-space bounds, AGT provides a formal approach to analyzing the behavior of models trained via first-order optimization methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study evaluates statistical, ML, and DL models for traffic forecasting using real-world California freeway data. ANFIS-GP excels at short-term predictions while Bi-LSTM is more robust for medium-term forecasting due to its ability to model long-range temporal dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With rapid urbanization and traffic congestion intensifying, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have become essential for managing traffic within existing infrastructure. Traffic forecasting enables proactive measures like ramp metering and dynamic routing.

Method: Used real-world traffic data from California's Harbor Freeway (Caltrans PeMS) to evaluate statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models over 20 forecasting windows (up to 1 hour 40 minutes). Performance measured using RMSE, MAE, and R-Square metrics, with degradation quantified using logarithmic transformation.

Result: ANFIS-GP performed best at early windows (RMSE: 0.038, MAE: 0.0276, R-Square: 0.9983), while Bi-LSTM was more robust for medium-term prediction (RMSE: 0.1863, MAE: 0.0833, R-Square: 0.987 at forecasting window 20). Bi-LSTM had the flattest degradation slope among DL models.

Conclusion: Hybrid models are identified as a promising future direction for traffic forecasting, combining the strengths of different approaches for improved performance across various time horizons.

Abstract: With rapid urbanization in recent decades, traffic congestion has intensified due to increased movement of people and goods. As planning shifts from demand-based to supply-oriented strategies, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have become essential for managing traffic within existing infrastructure. A core ITS function is traffic forecasting, enabling proactive measures like ramp metering, signal control, and dynamic routing through platforms such as Google Maps. This study assesses the performance of statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models in forecasting traffic speed and flow using real-world data from California's Harbor Freeway, sourced from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). Each model was evaluated over 20 forecasting windows (up to 1 hour 40 minutes) using RMSE, MAE, and R-Square metrics. Results show ANFIS-GP performs best at early windows with RMSE of 0.038, MAE of 0.0276, and R-Square of 0.9983, while Bi-LSTM is more robust for medium-term prediction due to its capacity to model long-range temporal dependencies, achieving RMSE of 0.1863, MAE of 0.0833, and R-Square of 0.987 at a forecasting of 20. The degradation in model performance was quantified using logarithmic transformation, with slope values used to measure robustness. Among DL models, Bi-LSTM had the flattest slope (0.0454 RMSE, 0.0545 MAE for flow), whereas ANFIS-GP had 0.1058 for RMSE and 0.1037 for flow MAE. The study concludes by identifying hybrid models as a promising future direction.

TL;DR: PTE is a retain-free unlearning framework that uses gradient ascent probing and push-pull optimization to selectively forget outdated knowledge in IIoT models without needing retain data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning methods require retain data which increases computational burden and conflicts with industrial data privacy requirements in dynamic IIoT environments.

Method: Probe-edit process: gradient ascent probing of decision boundaries, generating editing instructions from model predictions, then push-pull optimization - push branch dismantles target class regions, pull branch uses masked knowledge distillation to preserve retained knowledge.

Result: PTE achieves excellent balance between unlearning effectiveness and model utility across multiple benchmarks including CWRU and SCUT-FD, using only to-be-forgotten data and original model.

Conclusion: PTE provides an efficient retain-free unlearning solution suitable for industrial IoT environments with privacy constraints.

Abstract: In dynamic Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments, models need the ability to selectively forget outdated or erroneous knowledge. However, existing methods typically rely on retain data to constrain model behavior, which increases computational and energy burdens and conflicts with industrial data silos and privacy compliance requirements. To address this, we propose a novel retain-free unlearning framework, referred to as Probing then Editing (PTE). PTE frames unlearning as a probe-edit process: first, it probes the decision boundary neighborhood of the model on the to-be-forgotten class via gradient ascent and generates corresponding editing instructions using the model's own predictions. Subsequently, a push-pull collaborative optimization is performed: the push branch actively dismantles the decision region of the target class using the editing instructions, while the pull branch applies masked knowledge distillation to anchor the model's knowledge on retained classes to their original states. Benefiting from this mechanism, PTE achieves efficient and balanced knowledge editing using only the to-be-forgotten data and the original model. Experimental results demonstrate that PTE achieves an excellent balance between unlearning effectiveness and model utility across multiple general and industrial benchmarks such as CWRU and SCUT-FD.

TL;DR: AdaCuRL is an adaptive curriculum reinforcement learning framework that addresses gradient starvation and policy degradation in LLM reasoning by dynamically aligning data difficulty with model capability and preventing catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods for LLM reasoning suffer from gradient starvation and policy degradation when training on mixed-difficulty samples, while CoT-based approaches require labor-intensive annotations and curriculum learning methods face difficulty mismatch and catastrophic forgetting issues.

Method: Proposes AdaCuRL framework with coarse-to-fine difficulty estimation, adaptive curriculum scheduling, data revisitation mechanism, and adaptive reference with sparse KL strategies to prevent policy degradation.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks show that AdaCuRL consistently achieves significant performance improvements on both LLMs and MLLMs.

Conclusion: AdaCuRL effectively addresses the limitations of existing RL methods for LLM reasoning through adaptive curriculum learning and mitigation of catastrophic forgetting, demonstrating robust performance improvements across various benchmarks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated considerable potential for enhancing reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods suffer from Gradient Starvation and Policy Degradation when training directly on samples with mixed difficulty. To mitigate this, prior approaches leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data, but the construction of high-quality CoT annotations remains labor-intensive. Alternatively, curriculum learning strategies have been explored but frequently encounter challenges, such as difficulty mismatch, reliance on manual curriculum design, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose AdaCuRL, a Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates coarse-to-fine difficulty estimation with adaptive curriculum scheduling. This approach dynamically aligns data difficulty with model capability and incorporates a data revisitation mechanism to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, AdaCuRL employs adaptive reference and sparse KL strategies to prevent Policy Degradation. Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that AdaCuRL consistently achieves significant performance improvements on both LLMs and MLLMs.

TL;DR: TSGP uses a pre-trained transformer as a semantic variation operator to generate offspring programs with controlled semantic similarity, outperforming other GP methods on 24 benchmarks while producing compact solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a semantic search approach that learns diverse structural variations while maintaining semantic similarity, overcoming limitations of fixed syntactic transformations in traditional semantic GP.

Method: Uses a pre-trained transformer model trained on millions of programs as a variation operator, with target semantic distance (SD_t) parameter to control semantic similarity between parent and offspring.

Result: Achieved average rank of 1.58 across 24 real-world and synthetic datasets, significantly outperforming standard GP, SLIM_GSGP, Deep Symbolic Regression, and Denoising Autoencoder GP while producing more compact solutions than SLIM_GSGP.

Conclusion: TSGP effectively generalizes across symbolic regression problems, with SD_t providing a mechanism to balance exploration (small SD_t) and exploitation (large SD_t) in semantic space.

Abstract: Transformer Semantic Genetic Programming (TSGP) is a semantic search approach that uses a pre-trained transformer model as a variation operator to generate offspring programs with controlled semantic similarity to a given parent. Unlike other semantic GP approaches that rely on fixed syntactic transformations, TSGP aims to learn diverse structural variations that lead to solutions with similar semantics. We find that a single transformer model trained on millions of programs is able to generalize across symbolic regression problems of varying dimension. Evaluated on 24 real-world and synthetic datasets, TSGP significantly outperforms standard GP, SLIM_GSGP, Deep Symbolic Regression, and Denoising Autoencoder GP, achieving an average rank of 1.58 across all benchmarks. Moreover, TSGP produces more compact solutions than SLIM_GSGP, despite its higher accuracy. In addition, the target semantic distance $\mathrm{SD}_t$ is able to control the step size in the semantic space: small values of $\mathrm{SD}_t$ enable consistent improvement in fitness but often lead to larger programs, while larger values promote faster convergence and compactness. Thus, $\mathrm{SD}_t$ provides an effective mechanism for balancing exploration and exploitation.

Motivation: To theoretically understand neural network advantages and simplify analysis of training dynamics using over-parametrized sequence models inspired by Le Cam equivalence.

Method: Introduces feature error measure (FEM) to assess learned feature quality, analyzes training dynamics in adaptive feature models including linear regression and single/multiple index models.

Result: Shows that FEM decreases during training process across multiple adaptive feature models, providing evidence for the adaptive feature program's validity.

Conclusion: The decreasing FEM during training suggests the adaptive feature program has potential for success in understanding neural network feature learning characteristics.

Abstract: Theoretically exploring the advantages of neural networks might be one of the most challenging problems in the AI era. An adaptive feature program has recently been proposed to analyze the feature learning characteristic property of neural networks in a more abstract way. Motivated by the celebrated Le Cam equivalence, we advocate the over-parametrized sequence models to further simplify the analysis of the training dynamics of adaptive feature program and present several supporting evidences for the adaptive feature program. More precisely, after having introduced the feature error measure (FEM) to characterize the quality of the learned feature, we show that the FEM is decreasing during the training process of several concrete adaptive feature models including linear regression, single/multiple index models, etc. We believe that this hints at the potential successes of the adaptive feature program.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in adapting sparse autoencoders to domains beyond language, particularly scientific data with group symmetries, and improve feature interpretability.

Method: Develop adaptively equivariant SAEs that incorporate group symmetries and can adapt to the base model's level of equivariance, trained on synthetic images to understand activation transformations under rotation.

Result: Adaptive SAEs discover features that lead to superior probing performance compared to regular SAEs, with a single matrix explaining how activations transform as images rotate.

Conclusion: Incorporating symmetries into mechanistic interpretability tools like SAEs yields more useful features for downstream tasks in scientific domains.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have proven useful in disentangling the opaque activations of neural networks, primarily large language models, into sets of interpretable features. However, adapting them to domains beyond language, such as scientific data with group symmetries, introduces challenges that can hinder their effectiveness. We show that incorporating such group symmetries into the SAEs yields features more useful in downstream tasks. More specifically, we train autoencoders on synthetic images and find that a single matrix can explain how their activations transform as the images are rotated. Building on this, we develop adaptively equivariant SAEs that can adapt to the base model's level of equivariance. These adaptive SAEs discover features that lead to superior probing performance compared to regular SAEs, demonstrating the value of incorporating symmetries in mechanistic interpretability tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing SEP prediction methods are black-box models, making it difficult for solar physicists to interpret results and understand underlying physical causes beyond just getting predictions.

Method: Proposed framework combines global explanations with ad-hoc feature mapping to improve model transparency and provide deeper insights into decision-making processes.

Result: Validated on dataset of 341 SEP events (including 244 significant proton events exceeding S1 threshold) spanning solar cycles 22, 23, and 24; case study demonstrates improved explainability and physics-informed understanding.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enhances model transparency and facilitates more physics-informed understanding of SEP event predictions, addressing the black-box limitation of existing methods.

Abstract: Solar energetic particle (SEP) events, as one of the most prominent manifestations of solar activity, can generate severe hazardous radiation when accelerated by solar flares or shock waves formed aside from coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However, most existing data-driven methods used for SEP predictions are operated as black-box models, making it challenging for solar physicists to interpret the results and understand the underlying physical causes of such events rather than just obtain a prediction. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates global explanations and ad-hoc feature mapping to enhance model transparency and provide deeper insights into the decision-making process. We validate our approach using a dataset of 341 SEP events, including 244 significant (>=10 MeV) proton events exceeding the Space Weather Prediction Center S1 threshold, spanning solar cycles 22, 23, and 24. Furthermore, we present an explainability-focused case study of major SEP events, demonstrating how our method improves explainability and facilitates a more physics-informed understanding of SEP event prediction.

*Andrew Hamara,Greg Hamerly,Pablo Rivas,Andrew C. Freeman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SOLIS learns an evaluation-aligned embedding space using supervised contrastive learning, where planning is reduced to vector operations by ranking actions based on alignment with a global advantage vector from losing to winning regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether planning can be carried out directly in learned representations rather than through traditional policy or value learning, providing a lightweight alternative to dynamics models.

Method: Uses supervised contrastive learning to create an embedding space where outcome similarity is captured by proximity, with a single global advantage vector orienting the space from losing to winning. Planning is reduced to ranking candidate actions by their alignment with this direction.

Result: Demonstrated in chess where SOLIS uses only shallow search guided by the learned embedding to achieve competitive strength under constrained conditions.

Conclusion: Evaluation-aligned latent planning offers a lightweight alternative to traditional dynamics models or policy learning, showing promise for planning in high-dimensional decision spaces.

Abstract: Planning in high-dimensional decision spaces is increasingly being studied through the lens of learned representations. Rather than training policies or value heads, we investigate whether planning can be carried out directly in an evaluation-aligned embedding space. We introduce SOLIS, which learns such a space using supervised contrastive learning. In this representation, outcome similarity is captured by proximity, and a single global advantage vector orients the space from losing to winning regions. Candidate actions are then ranked according to their alignment with this direction, reducing planning to vector operations in latent space. We demonstrate this approach in chess, where SOLIS uses only a shallow search guided by the learned embedding to reach competitive strength under constrained conditions. More broadly, our results suggest that evaluation-aligned latent planning offers a lightweight alternative to traditional dynamics models or policy learning.

*Junqi Gao,Zhichang Guo,Dazhi Zhang,Yao Li,Yi Ran,Biqing Qi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes PDAC and SPDAC methods for efficient coreset selection in rehearsal-based continual learning by prioritizing samples with high probability density to reduce computational costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current coreset selection methods in rehearsal-based continual learning rely on computationally expensive bi-level optimization, limiting practical efficiency. The paper aims to develop a more efficient selection scheme.

Method: Analyzes MSE between buffer-trained and Bayes-optimal models, identifies high-density samples' dominant role in error suppression, proposes PDAC using Projected Gaussian Mixture model for density estimation, and SPDAC with streaming EM for streaming scenarios.

Result: Extensive experiments show the methods outperform other baselines across various continual learning settings while maintaining favorable computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Probability density-aware coreset selection provides an effective and efficient alternative to traditional optimization-based methods for rehearsal-based continual learning.

Abstract: Rehearsal-based Continual Learning (CL) maintains a limited memory buffer to store replay samples for knowledge retention, making these approaches heavily reliant on the quality of the stored samples. Current Rehearsal-based CL methods typically construct the memory buffer by selecting a representative subset (referred to as coresets), aiming to approximate the training efficacy of the full dataset with minimal storage overhead. However, mainstream Coreset Selection (CS) methods generally formulate the CS problem as a bi-level optimization problem that relies on numerous inner and outer iterations to solve, leading to substantial computational cost thus limiting their practical efficiency. In this paper, we aim to provide a more efficient selection logic and scheme for coreset construction. To this end, we first analyze the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the buffer-trained model and the Bayes-optimal model through the perspective of localized error decomposition to investigate the contribution of samples from different regions to MSE suppression. Further theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that samples with high probability density play a dominant role in error suppression. Inspired by this, we propose the Probability Density-Aware Coreset (PDAC) method. PDAC leverages the Projected Gaussian Mixture (PGM) model to estimate each sample's joint density, enabling efficient density-prioritized buffer selection. Finally, we introduce the streaming Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to enhance the adaptability of PGM parameters to streaming data, yielding Streaming PDAC (SPDAC) for streaming scenarios. Extensive comparative experiments show that our methods outperforms other baselines across various CL settings while ensuring favorable efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoSynth automates workflow discovery and optimization for synthetic data generation without requiring labeled datasets, using Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by a dataset-free hybrid reward to tackle the cold start problem in subjective LLM tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual curation of high-quality datasets for supervised fine-tuning is expensive, while existing automated methods require labeled datasets for reward modeling, creating a cold start problem especially for subjective tasks with no objective ground truth.

Method: Reframes workflow discovery as Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by a novel dataset-free hybrid reward with two LLM-as-judge components: one evaluates sample quality using dynamically generated task-specific metrics, and another assesses workflow code and prompt quality.

Result: Models trained on AutoSynth-generated data dramatically outperform baselines (40-51% vs. 2-5%) and match or surpass expert workflows on certain metrics, while reducing human effort from 5-7 hours to 30 minutes (>90% reduction).

Conclusion: AutoSynth effectively tackles the cold start issue in data-centric AI, offering a scalable, cost-effective method for subjective LLM tasks by discovering quality dimensions beyond human intuition.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models (LLMs) for specialized tasks requires high-quality datasets, but manual curation is prohibitively expensive. Synthetic data generation offers scalability, but its effectiveness relies on complex, multi-stage workflows, integrating prompt engineering and model orchestration. Existing automated workflow methods face a cold start problem: they require labeled datasets for reward modeling, which is especially problematic for subjective, open-ended tasks with no objective ground truth. We introduce AutoSynth, a framework that automates workflow discovery and optimization without reference datasets by reframing the problem as a Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by a novel dataset-free hybrid reward. This reward enables meta-learning through two LLM-as-judge components: one evaluates sample quality using dynamically generated task-specific metrics, and another assesses workflow code and prompt quality. Experiments on subjective educational tasks show that while expert-designed workflows achieve higher human preference rates (96-99% win rates vs. AutoSynth's 40-51%), models trained on AutoSynth-generated data dramatically outperform baselines (40-51% vs. 2-5%) and match or surpass expert workflows on certain metrics, suggesting discovery of quality dimensions beyond human intuition. These results are achieved while reducing human effort from 5-7 hours to just 30 minutes (>90% reduction). AutoSynth tackles the cold start issue in data-centric AI, offering a scalable, cost-effective method for subjective LLM tasks. Code: https://github.com/bisz9918-maker/AutoSynth.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A second-order deterministic actor-critic framework that uses quadratic critic approximation to exploit curvature information for faster convergence in reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend classical deterministic policy gradient methods by incorporating second-order information (curvature) to achieve faster convergence compared to first-order methods.

Method: Proposes a quadratic critic that preserves true policy gradient and approximates performance Hessian, with least-squares temporal difference learning for efficient parameter estimation, enabling quasi-Newton actor updates.

Result: Numerical examples show improved convergence and performance over standard deterministic actor-critic baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed second-order framework effectively exploits curvature information through quadratic critic approximation, yielding faster convergence while remaining general and applicable to any differentiable policy class.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a second-order deterministic actor-critic framework in reinforcement learning that extends the classical deterministic policy gradient method to exploit curvature information of the performance function. Building on the concept of compatible function approximation for the critic, we introduce a quadratic critic that simultaneously preserves the true policy gradient and an approximation of the performance Hessian. A least-squares temporal difference learning scheme is then developed to estimate the quadratic critic parameters efficiently. This construction enables a quasi-Newton actor update using information learned by the critic, yielding faster convergence compared to first-order methods. The proposed approach is general and applicable to any differentiable policy class. Numerical examples demonstrate that the method achieves improved convergence and performance over standard deterministic actor-critic baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GenePheno is the first interpretable multi-label framework that predicts knockout-induced phenotypic abnormalities directly from gene sequences, using contrastive learning and biological regularization to capture phenotype correlations and functional mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either focus on limited phenotypes or rely on curated genetic information, limiting scalability and generalizability. The task of broadly predicting multiple phenotype abnormalities from gene sequences remains underexplored.

Method: Uses contrastive multi-label learning to capture inter-phenotype correlations, exclusive regularization for biological consistency, and a gene function bottleneck layer for interpretability. Trained on four curated datasets with gene sequences as input and multi-label phenotypic abnormalities as targets.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art gene-centric Fmax and phenotype-centric AUC across datasets. Case studies demonstrate its ability to reveal gene functional mechanisms.

Conclusion: GenePheno provides an effective and interpretable framework for predicting phenotypic abnormalities from gene sequences, bridging the modality gap and enabling scalable hypothesis-driven experimentation in biology.

Abstract: Exploring how genetic sequences shape phenotypes is a fundamental challenge in biology and a key step toward scalable, hypothesis-driven experimentation. The task is complicated by the large modality gap between sequences and phenotypes, as well as the pleiotropic nature of gene-phenotype relationships. Existing sequence-based efforts focus on the degree to which variants of specific genes alter a limited set of phenotypes, while general gene knockout induced phenotype abnormality prediction methods heavily rely on curated genetic information as inputs, which limits scalability and generalizability. As a result, the task of broadly predicting the presence of multiple phenotype abnormalities under gene knockout directly from gene sequences remains underexplored. We introduce GenePheno, the first interpretable multi-label prediction framework that predicts knockout induced phenotypic abnormalities from gene sequences. GenePheno employs a contrastive multi-label learning objective that captures inter-phenotype correlations, complemented by an exclusive regularization that enforces biological consistency. It further incorporates a gene function bottleneck layer, offering human interpretable concepts that reflect functional mechanisms behind phenotype formation. To support progress in this area, we curate four datasets with canonical gene sequences as input and multi-label phenotypic abnormalities induced by gene knockouts as targets. Across these datasets, GenePheno achieves state-of-the-art gene-centric Fmax and phenotype-centric AUC, and case studies demonstrate its ability to reveal gene functional mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM's performance is limited with small labeled datasets, while medical data contains abundant hierarchical information that is often overlooked.

Method: Proposes SAMora framework with complementary self-supervised learning objectives at image, patch, and pixel levels, and HL-Attn hierarchical fusion module to integrate multi-scale features.

Result: Outperforms existing SAM variants on Synapse, LA, and PROMISE12 datasets in both few-shot and fully supervised settings, with 90% reduction in fine-tuning epochs.

Conclusion: SAMora effectively captures hierarchical medical knowledge and achieves state-of-the-art performance while being compatible with various SAM variants.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated significant potential in medical image segmentation. Yet, its performance is limited when only a small amount of labeled data is available, while there is abundant valuable yet often overlooked hierarchical information in medical data. To address this limitation, we draw inspiration from self-supervised learning and propose SAMora, an innovative framework that captures hierarchical medical knowledge by applying complementary self-supervised learning objectives at the image, patch, and pixel levels. To fully exploit the complementarity of hierarchical knowledge within LoRAs, we introduce HL-Attn, a hierarchical fusion module that integrates multi-scale features while maintaining their distinct characteristics. SAMora is compatible with various SAM variants, including SAM2, SAMed, and H-SAM. Experimental results on the Synapse, LA, and PROMISE12 datasets demonstrate that SAMora outperforms existing SAM variants. It achieves state-of-the-art performance in both few-shot and fully supervised settings while reducing fine-tuning epochs by 90%. The code is available at https://github.com/ShChen233/SAMora.

TL;DR: A robust multi-modal task-oriented communication framework using two-stage variational information bottleneck with mutual information minimization to compress inter-modal redundancy and improve semantic reliability under channel distortion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of simultaneously compressing inter-modal redundancy and improving semantic reliability under channel distortion in multi-modal semantic communications.

Method: Two-stage variational information bottleneck (VIB) with mutual information redundancy minimization: 1) uni-modal VIB for modality-specific compression, 2) MI minimization with adversarial training to suppress cross-modal dependencies, and 3) multi-modal VIB for fused representation compression and robustness enhancement.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing baselines in accuracy and reliability on multi-modal emotion recognition tasks, particularly under low signal-to-noise ratio regimes.

Conclusion: Provides a principled framework that jointly optimizes modality-specific compression, inter-modal redundancy, and communication reliability for multi-modal semantic communications.

Abstract: Semantic communications for multi-modal data can transmit task-relevant information efficiently over noisy and bandwidth-limited channels. However, a key challenge is to simultaneously compress inter-modal redundancy and improve semantic reliability under channel distortion. To address the challenge, we propose a robust and efficient multi-modal task-oriented communication framework that integrates a two-stage variational information bottleneck (VIB) with mutual information (MI) redundancy minimization. In the first stage, we apply uni-modal VIB to compress each modality separately, i.e., text, audio, and video, while preserving task-specific features. To enhance efficiency, an MI minimization module with adversarial training is then used to suppress cross-modal dependencies and to promote complementarity rather than redundancy. In the second stage, a multi-modal VIB is further used to compress the fused representation and to enhance robustness against channel distortion. Experimental results on multi-modal emotion recognition tasks demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms existing baselines in accuracy and reliability, particularly under low signal-to-noise ratio regimes. Our work provides a principled framework that jointly optimizes modality-specific compression, inter-modal redundancy, and communication reliability.

Motivation: Conventional fluence map optimization is time-consuming and dependent on planner expertise, creating need for automated, efficient solutions that maintain clinical quality.

Method: End-to-end 3D Swin-UNETR network trained on 99 prostate IMRT cases (79 training, 20 testing) to predict nine-beam fluence maps from CT images and anatomical contours using hierarchical self-attention.

Result: Achieved R^2 of 0.95±0.02, MAE of 0.035±0.008, gamma passing rate of 85±10% (3%/3mm), with no significant DVH differences between predicted and clinical plans.

Conclusion: The framework enables fully automated, inverse-free fluence map prediction with enhanced spatial coherence, accuracy, and efficiency, offering scalable solution for automated IMRT plan generation.

Abstract: Accurate fluence map prediction is essential in intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) to maximize tumor coverage while minimizing dose to healthy tissues. Conventional optimization is time-consuming and dependent on planner expertise. This study presents a deep learning framework that accelerates fluence map generation while maintaining clinical quality. An end-to-end 3D Swin-UNETR network was trained to predict nine-beam fluence maps directly from volumetric CT images and anatomical contours using 99 prostate IMRT cases (79 for training and 20 for testing). The transformer-based model employs hierarchical self-attention to capture both local anatomical structures and long-range spatial dependencies. Predicted fluence maps were imported into the Eclipse Treatment Planning System for dose recalculation, and model performance was evaluated using beam-wise fluence correlation, spatial gamma analysis, and dose-volume histogram (DVH) metrics. The proposed model achieved an average R^2 of 0.95 +/- 0.02, MAE of 0.035 +/- 0.008, and gamma passing rate of 85 +/- 10 percent (3 percent / 3 mm) on the test set, with no significant differences observed in DVH parameters between predicted and clinical plans. The Swin-UNETR framework enables fully automated, inverse-free fluence map prediction directly from anatomical inputs, enhancing spatial coherence, accuracy, and efficiency while offering a scalable and consistent solution for automated IMRT plan generation.

TL;DR: Proposes a novel feature extraction method using persistent homology on structural MRI to diagnose Alzheimer's disease, achieving high accuracy with simple machine learning models while requiring minimal preprocessing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With approved Alzheimer's disease therapies, there's an urgent need for early, objective, and accurate diagnosis using low-cost measurement modalities like structural MRI.

Method: Uses persistent homology to extract topological features from brain MRI, converts them into feature vectors via Betti functions, and integrates with XGBoost for efficient classification.

Result: Achieved 97.43% accuracy and 99.09% sensitivity for binary classification, and 95.47% accuracy and 94.98% sensitivity for three-class classification on ADNI 3D MRI data, outperforming state-of-the-art deep learning models.

Conclusion: The topological approach provides complementary information to conventional deep learning, requires no data augmentation or extensive preprocessing, and is suitable for smaller datasets while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Now that disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer disease have been approved by regulatory agencies, the early, objective, and accurate clinical diagnosis of AD based on the lowest-cost measurement modalities possible has become an increasingly urgent need. In this study, we propose a novel feature extraction method using persistent homology to analyze structural MRI of the brain. This approach converts topological features into powerful feature vectors through Betti functions. By integrating these feature vectors with a simple machine learning model like XGBoost, we achieve a computationally efficient machine learning model. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models in both binary and three-class classification tasks for ADNI 3D MRI disease diagnosis. Using 10-fold cross-validation, our model achieved an average accuracy of 97.43 percent and sensitivity of 99.09 percent for binary classification. For three-class classification, it achieved an average accuracy of 95.47 percent and sensitivity of 94.98 percent. Unlike many deep learning models, our approach does not require data augmentation or extensive preprocessing, making it particularly suitable for smaller datasets. Topological features differ significantly from those commonly extracted using convolutional filters and other deep learning machinery. Because it provides an entirely different type of information from machine learning models, it has the potential to combine topological features with other models later on.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable multi-view perception in distributed systems while maintaining representation diversity and avoiding correlated subspaces that occur in baseline methods.

Method: Each agent performs periodic SVD on learned subspaces, exchanges truncated basis matrices, fuses subspaces, and enforces representations toward fused subspaces using projection matrices and distance minimization.

Result: Theoretical guarantees include bounded trace on coding-rate change and consistency of basis fusion. Numerical simulations show high classification accuracy with maintained representation diversity compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm successfully achieves compositional distributed learning for multi-view perception with theoretical guarantees and superior performance over baseline methods.

Abstract: In this letter, we formulate a compositional distributed learning framework for multi-view perception by leveraging the maximal coding rate reduction principle combined with subspace basis fusion. In the proposed algorithm, each agent conducts a periodic singular value decomposition on its learned subspaces and exchanges truncated basis matrices, based on which the fused subspaces are obtained. By introducing a projection matrix and minimizing the distance between the outputs and its projection, the learned representations are enforced towards the fused subspaces. It is proved that the trace on the coding-rate change is bounded and the consistency of basis fusion is guaranteed theoretically. Numerical simulations validate that the proposed algorithm achieves high classification accuracy while maintaining representations' diversity, compared to baselines showing correlated subspaces and coupled representations.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposes an implicit bit allocation method for ROI-based image compression using a Mask-Guided Feature Enhancement module with dual decoders, outperforming explicit methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ROI compression methods use explicit bit allocation with hard gating, which disrupts entropy model statistics and limits coding performance.

Method: Uses Mask-Guided Feature Enhancement module with Region-Adaptive Attention and Frequency-Spatial Collaborative Attention blocks, plus dual decoders for separate foreground/background reconstruction.

Result: Significantly outperforms explicit bit allocation approaches in rate-distortion performance on COCO2017 dataset while maintaining good background quality.

Conclusion: First work to use implicit bit allocation for region-adaptive coding, achieving optimal results with flexible bit allocation and frequency-spatial collaboration.

Abstract: Region of Interest (ROI)-based image compression has rapidly developed due to its ability to maintain high fidelity in important regions while reducing data redundancy. However, existing compression methods primarily apply masks to suppress background information before quantization. This explicit bit allocation strategy, which uses hard gating, significantly impacts the statistical distribution of the entropy model, thereby limiting the coding performance of the compression model. In response, this work proposes an efficient ROI-based deep image compression model with implicit bit allocation. To better utilize ROI masks for implicit bit allocation, this paper proposes a novel Mask-Guided Feature Enhancement (MGFE) module, comprising a Region-Adaptive Attention (RAA) block and a Frequency-Spatial Collaborative Attention (FSCA) block. This module allows for flexible bit allocation across different regions while enhancing global and local features through frequencyspatial domain collaboration. Additionally, we use dual decoders to separately reconstruct foreground and background images, enabling the coding network to optimally balance foreground enhancement and background quality preservation in a datadriven manner. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to utilize implicit bit allocation for high-quality regionadaptive coding. Experiments on the COCO2017 dataset show that our implicit-based image compression method significantly outperforms explicit bit allocation approaches in rate-distortion performance, achieving optimal results while maintaining satisfactory visual quality in the reconstructed background regions.

Motivation: Ultra-low-field MRI offers broader accessibility but suffers from poor signal-to-noise ratio and resolution. Image translation can map ULF to high-field appearance, but is limited by scarce paired training data.

Method: Used task-adapted data augmentations including auxiliary tasks on high-field data with a standard deep model for ULF image enhancement, working within challenge constraints of 50 paired 3D volumes and no external data.

Conclusion: Effective data augmentation strategies can significantly enhance ULF MRI image quality even with limited paired training data, making low-field MRI more clinically useful.

Abstract: Ultra-low-field (ULF) MRI promises broader accessibility but suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), reduced spatial resolution, and contrasts that deviate from high-field standards. Imageto- image translation can map ULF images to a high-field appearance, yet efficacy is limited by scarce paired training data. Working within the ULF-EnC challenge constraints (50 paired 3D volumes; no external data), we study how task-adapted data augmentations impact a standard deep model for ULF image enhancement. We show that strong, diverse augmentations, including auxiliary tasks on high-field data, substantially improve fidelity.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A system that translates English into Answer Set Programming (ASP) code for logic puzzles using LLMs and AMR graphs, minimizing LLM dependency for better explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASP is powerful for combinatorial problems but requires programming knowledge, while non-programmers increasingly need to interact with code. Need a method to translate natural language to ASP without heavy LLM reliance.

Method: Uses LLM only for simple tasks (sentence simplification, keyword identification, fact generation), then parses AMR graphs from simplified language to systematically generate ASP constraints and rules.

Result: Successfully creates complete ASP programs that solve combinatorial logic problems, demonstrating the system's capability with example logic puzzles.

Conclusion: This approach represents a significant first step toward creating lightweight, explainable systems that convert natural language to solve complex logic problems.

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a declarative programming paradigm based on logic programming and non-monotonic reasoning. It is a tremendously powerful tool for describing and solving combinatorial problems. Like any other language, ASP requires users to learn how it works and the syntax involved. It is becoming increasingly required for those unfamiliar with programming languages to interact with code. This paper proposes a novel method of translating unconstrained English into ASP programs for logic puzzles using an LLM and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. Everything from ASP rules, facts, and constraints is generated to fully represent and solve the desired problem. Example logic puzzles are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. While most current methods rely entirely on an LLM, our system minimizes the role of the LLM only to complete straightforward tasks. The LLM is used to simplify natural language sentences, identify keywords, and generate simple facts. The AMR graphs are then parsed from simplified language and used to generate ASP constraints systematically. The system successfully creates an entire ASP program that solves a combinatorial logic problem. This approach is a significant first step in creating a lighter-weight, explainable system that converts natural language to solve complex logic problems.

Motivation: The ARC-AGI benchmark is extremely difficult for AI systems despite being easy for humans, suggesting a need for more cognitively plausible approaches inspired by human intelligence modeling.

Method: Integrates System 1 intuitions with System 2 reasoning using neurosymbolic methods based on Vector Symbolic Algebras (VSAs) for object-centric program synthesis.

Result: Achieves 10.8% on ARC-AGI-1-Train and 3.0% on ARC-AGI-1-Eval, with strong performance on simpler benchmarks (94.5% on Sort-of-ARC, 83.1% on 1D-ARC) while outperforming GPT-4 at much lower computational cost.

Conclusion: The approach represents the first application of VSAs to ARC-AGI and demonstrates the most cognitively plausible solver yet, showing promise for neurosymbolic methods in artificial general intelligence.

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) is a generative, few-shot fluid intelligence benchmark. Although humans effortlessly solve ARC-AGI, it remains extremely difficult for even the most advanced artificial intelligence systems. Inspired by methods for modelling human intelligence spanning neuroscience to psychology, we propose a cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver. Our solver integrates System 1 intuitions with System 2 reasoning in an efficient and interpretable process using neurosymbolic methods based on Vector Symbolic Algebras (VSAs). Our solver works by object-centric program synthesis, leveraging VSAs to represent abstract objects, guide solution search, and enable sample-efficient neural learning. Preliminary results indicate success, with our solver scoring 10.8% on ARC-AGI-1-Train and 3.0% on ARC-AGI-1-Eval. Additionally, our solver performs well on simpler benchmarks, scoring 94.5% on Sort-of-ARC and 83.1% on 1D-ARC -- the latter outperforming GPT-4 at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. Importantly, our approach is unique; we believe we are the first to apply VSAs to ARC-AGI and have developed the most cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver yet.

Method: Query Conditioned Deterministic Inference Networks (QDIN) - a unified architecture with specialized neural modules optimized for different inference patterns (policy, reachability, paths, comparisons).

Result: Inference accuracy reaches near-perfect levels (99% reachability IoU) even when control performance remains suboptimal (31% return), showing decoupling between world knowledge representations and control representations.

Conclusion: Establishes a research agenda for RL systems designed as queryable knowledge bases from inception, with implications for interpretability, verification, and human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has traditionally focused on a singular objective: learning policies that select actions to maximize reward. We challenge this paradigm by asking: what if we explicitly architected RL systems as inference engines that can answer diverse queries about their environment? In deterministic settings, trained agents implicitly encode rich knowledge about reachability, distances, values, and dynamics - yet current architectures are not designed to expose this information efficiently. We introduce Query Conditioned Deterministic Inference Networks (QDIN), a unified architecture that treats different types of queries (policy, reachability, paths, comparisons) as first-class citizens, with specialized neural modules optimized for each inference pattern. Our key empirical finding reveals a fundamental decoupling: inference accuracy can reach near-perfect levels (99% reachability IoU) even when control performance remains suboptimal (31% return), suggesting that the representations needed for accurate world knowledge differ from those required for optimal control. Experiments demonstrate that query specialized architectures outperform both unified models and post-hoc extraction methods, while maintaining competitive control performance. This work establishes a research agenda for RL systems designed from inception as queryable knowledge bases, with implications for interpretability, verification, and human-AI collaboration.

### [192] [Neural Value Iteration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08825)
*Yang You,Ufuk Çakır,Alex Schutz,Robert Skilton,Nick Hawes*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Neural Value Iteration, a novel POMDP planning algorithm that represents value functions using neural networks instead of α-vectors, enabling scalability to large-scale problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional POMDP solvers using α-vectors become intractable for large-scale problems due to the high computational cost of Bellman backups on |S|-dimensional vectors.

Method: Leverages the PWLC property to represent POMDP value functions as finite sets of neural networks, combining neural networks' generalization capability with classical value iteration.

Result: Achieves near-optimal solutions in extremely large POMDPs that are intractable for existing offline solvers.

Conclusion: Neural networks provide an effective alternative representation for POMDP value functions, enabling scalable planning in large state spaces.

Abstract: The value function of a POMDP exhibits the piecewise-linear-convex (PWLC) property and can be represented as a finite set of hyperplanes, known as $α$-vectors. Most state-of-the-art POMDP solvers (offline planners) follow the point-based value iteration scheme, which performs Bellman backups on $α$-vectors at reachable belief points until convergence. However, since each $α$-vector is $|S|$-dimensional, these methods quickly become intractable for large-scale problems due to the prohibitive computational cost of Bellman backups. In this work, we demonstrate that the PWLC property allows a POMDP's value function to be alternatively represented as a finite set of neural networks. This insight enables a novel POMDP planning algorithm called \emph{Neural Value Iteration}, which combines the generalization capability of neural networks with the classical value iteration framework. Our approach achieves near-optimal solutions even in extremely large POMDPs that are intractable for existing offline solvers.

*Shouang Wei,Min Zhang,Xin Lin,Bo Jiang,Kun Kuang,Zhongxiang Dai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UCO is a reinforcement learning method that uses multi-turn interactions with two reward functions to improve LLMs as intelligent tutors by capturing cognitive progress and adapting to students' Zone of Proximal Development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM fine-tuning methods for education lack dynamic adaptation capabilities and cannot distinguish genuine student understanding from answer echoing. Reinforcement learning approaches face challenges in evaluating true learning and perceiving evolving cognitive states.

Method: UCO uses multi-turn interactive reinforcement learning with two synergistic reward functions: Progress Reward (captures cognitive advancement from confusion to comprehension) and Scaffold Reward (identifies Zone of Proximal Development to maintain productive teaching).

Result: UCO outperforms 11 baseline models on BigMath and MathTutorBench benchmarks, achieving performance comparable to advanced closed-source models.

Conclusion: The proposed UCO method effectively addresses limitations in current educational LLM approaches by enabling dynamic adaptation to students' cognitive states and distinguishing genuine understanding from answer echoing.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are shifting from answer providers to intelligent tutors in educational settings, yet current supervised fine-tuning methods only learn surface teaching patterns without dynamic adaptation capabilities. Recent reinforcement learning approaches address this limitation but face two critical challenges. First, they evaluate teaching effectiveness solely based on whether students produce correct outputs, unable to distinguish whether students genuinely understand or echo teacher-provided answers during interaction. Second, they cannot perceive students' evolving cognitive states in real time through interactive dialogue, thus failing to adapt teaching strategies to match students' cognitive levels dynamically. We propose the Unidirectional Cognitive Optimization (UCO) method to address these challenges. UCO uses a multi-turn interactive reinforcement learning paradigm where the innovation lies in two synergistic reward functions: the Progress Reward captures students' cognitive advancement, evaluating whether students truly transition from confusion to comprehension, while the Scaffold Reward dynamically identifies each student's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), encouraging teachers to maintain productive teaching within this zone. We evaluate UCO by comparing it against 11 baseline models on BigMath and MathTutorBench benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our UCO model outperforms all models of equivalent scale and achieves performance comparable to advanced closed-source models.

Abstract: We introduce Lumine, the first open recipe for developing generalist agents capable of completing hours-long complex missions in real time within challenging 3D open-world environments. Lumine adopts a human-like interaction paradigm that unifies perception, reasoning, and action in an end-to-end manner, powered by a vision-language model. It processes raw pixels at 5 Hz to produce precise 30 Hz keyboard-mouse actions and adaptively invokes reasoning only when necessary. Trained in Genshin Impact, Lumine successfully completes the entire five-hour Mondstadt main storyline on par with human-level efficiency and follows natural language instructions to perform a broad spectrum of tasks in both 3D open-world exploration and 2D GUI manipulation across collection, combat, puzzle-solving, and NPC interaction. In addition to its in-domain performance, Lumine demonstrates strong zero-shot cross-game generalization. Without any fine-tuning, it accomplishes 100-minute missions in Wuthering Waves and the full five-hour first chapter of Honkai: Star Rail. These promising results highlight Lumine's effectiveness across distinct worlds and interaction dynamics, marking a concrete step toward generalist agents in open-ended environments.

*Graham L. Bishop*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Bioacoustic AI systems overlook the fundamental issue of recursive cognition encounters between AI and animal communication, creating a double contingency problem that requires rethinking AI as diplomatic encounters rather than universal pattern recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current bioacoustic AI systems achieve cross-species performance but overlook how AI's recursive cognition (attention mechanisms, iterative processing) interacts with animals' recursive communicative processes, potentially distorting understanding.

Method: Drawing on philosopher Yuk Hui's work on recursivity and contingency, the paper analyzes the double contingency problem where both species communication and AI processing emerge from different contingent conditions.

Result: The analysis reveals that AI systems are not neutral pattern detectors but recursive cognitive agents whose processing may systematically obscure or distort other species' communicative structures.

Conclusion: Addressing this challenge requires reconceptualizing bioacoustic AI from universal pattern recognition toward diplomatic encounter between different forms of recursive cognition, with implications for model design, evaluation frameworks, and research methodologies.

Abstract: Current bioacoustic AI systems achieve impressive cross-species performance by processing animal communication through transformer architectures, foundation model paradigms, and other computational approaches. However, these approaches overlook a fundamental question: what happens when one form of recursive cognition--AI systems with their attention mechanisms, iterative processing, and feedback loops--encounters the recursive communicative processes of other species? Drawing on philosopher Yuk Hui's work on recursivity and contingency, I argue that AI systems are not neutral pattern detectors but recursive cognitive agents whose own information processing may systematically obscure or distort other species' communicative structures. This creates a double contingency problem: each species' communication emerges through contingent ecological and evolutionary conditions, while AI systems process these signals through their own contingent architectural and training conditions. I propose that addressing this challenge requires reconceptualizing bioacoustic AI from universal pattern recognition toward diplomatic encounter between different forms of recursive cognition, with implications for model design, evaluation frameworks, and research methodologies.

*Xiaohan Zhang,Tian Gao,Mingyue Cheng,Bokai Pan,Ze Guo,Yaguo Liu,Xiaoyu Tao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AlphaCast is a human-LLM co-reasoning framework that transforms time series forecasting from a static task into an interactive process through automated preparation and generative reasoning stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current forecasting approaches lack the interaction, reasoning, and adaptability of human experts, limiting their usefulness in complex real-world environments.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) automated prediction preparation with multi-source cognitive foundation (feature set, domain knowledge base, contextual repository, case base), and (2) generative reasoning with meta-reasoning loop for continuous self-correction.

Result: Extensive experiments show AlphaCast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy on both short- and long-term datasets.

Conclusion: AlphaCast successfully bridges the gap between automated forecasting and human expert reasoning by enabling step-by-step collaboration between human wisdom and LLM intelligence.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in high-stakes domains such as energy, healthcare, and climate. Although recent advances have improved accuracy, most approaches still treat forecasting as a static one-time mapping task, lacking the interaction, reasoning, and adaptability of human experts. This gap limits their usefulness in complex real-world environments. To address this, we propose AlphaCast, a human wisdom-large language model (LLM) intelligence co-reasoning framework that redefines forecasting as an interactive process. The key idea is to enable step-by-step collaboration between human wisdom and LLM intelligence to jointly prepare, generate, and verify forecasts. The framework consists of two stages: (1) automated prediction preparation, where AlphaCast builds a multi-source cognitive foundation comprising a feature set that captures key statistics and time patterns, a domain knowledge base distilled from corpora and historical series, a contextual repository that stores rich information for each time window, and a case base that retrieves optimal strategies via pattern clustering and matching; and (2) generative reasoning and reflective optimization, where AlphaCast integrates statistical temporal features, prior knowledge, contextual information, and forecasting strategies, triggering a meta-reasoning loop for continuous self-correction and strategy refinement. Extensive experiments on short- and long-term datasets show that AlphaCast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exact computation of extensions under stable semantics in ABA is intractable for large frameworks, necessitating scalable approximation methods.

Method: Model ABA frameworks as dependency graphs with heterogeneous edges, then develop two GNN architectures (ABAGCN and ABAGAT) using residual heterogeneous convolution/attention layers trained on ICCMA 2023 benchmark.

Result: Both models outperform adapted GNN baseline, achieving 0.71 F1 score on ICCMA instances; extension-reconstruction algorithm achieves F1 above 0.85 on small ABAFs and ~0.58 on large frameworks.

Conclusion: This work opens new avenues for scalable approximate reasoning in structured argumentation using GNNs.

Abstract: Assumption-Based Argumentation (ABA) is a powerful structured argumentation formalism, but exact computation of extensions under stable semantics is intractable for large frameworks. We present the first Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach to approximate credulous acceptance in ABA. To leverage GNNs, we model ABA frameworks via a dependency graph representation encoding assumptions, claims and rules as nodes, with heterogeneous edge labels distinguishing support, derive and attack relations. We propose two GNN architectures - ABAGCN and ABAGAT - that stack residual heterogeneous convolution or attention layers, respectively, to learn node embeddings. Our models are trained on the ICCMA 2023 benchmark, augmented with synthetic ABAFs, with hyperparameters optimised via Bayesian search. Empirically, both ABAGCN and ABAGAT outperform a state-of-the-art GNN baseline that we adapt from the abstract argumentation literature, achieving a node-level F1 score of up to 0.71 on the ICCMA instances. Finally, we develop a sound polynomial time extension-reconstruction algorithm driven by our predictor: it reconstructs stable extensions with F1 above 0.85 on small ABAFs and maintains an F1 of about 0.58 on large frameworks. Our work opens new avenues for scalable approximate reasoning in structured argumentation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Recursive refinement in multi-agent LLM pipelines enhances reasoning by implementing gradual, incremental, sequential search, outperforming simple linear approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extract stronger reasoning capabilities from LLMs by structuring multi-agent pipelines that ensure controlled, incremental search through the reasoning space.

Method: Used recursive refinement (self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, critical feedback integration) in multi-agent pipelines with historical personas (Hamilton, Jefferson, Madison) on contemporary political issues.

Result: Complex model with recursive refinement consistently outperformed simple model (88.3 vs 71.7 average score), showing superior analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing.

Conclusion: Recursive refinement is a robust architectural feature for enhancing LLM reasoning via gradual, incremental, sequential search.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional fluency, efforts persist to extract stronger reasoning capabilities from them. Drawing on search-based interpretations of LLM computation, this paper advances a systematic framework for understanding LLM reasoning and optimization. Namely, that enhancing reasoning is best achieved by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to ensure a traversal of the search space in a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) manner. Stated succinctly, high-quality reasoning is a controlled, incremental search. To test this framework, we investigate the efficacy of recursive refinement (RR)--an iterative process of self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, and integrating critical feedback--as a practical method for implementing GIS search. We designed an experiment comparing a simple, linear pipeline against a complex, explicitly structured pipeline leveraging a recursive refinement layer. The multi-agent models were constructed to reflect the historical personas of three US Founding Fathers (Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison) using RAG-powered corpora and were prompted to generate responses to three contemporary political issues. Model performance was evaluated using a two-tiered approach: a quantitative score from an LLM arbiter agent and qualitative human judgment. Our results revealed that the complex model consistently outperformed the simple model across all nine test cases with an average arbiter-outputted score of 88.3 versus 71.7. The complex model's arguments were superior in analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing. We conclude that recursive refinement is a robust architectural feature for enhancing LLM reasoning via GIS search.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MAKER is the first system to successfully solve tasks with over one million LLM steps with zero errors through extreme task decomposition and multi-agent error correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs have persistent error rates that prevent scaling to long-range tasks at human/organizational scale, as they inevitably derail after a few hundred steps despite breakthroughs in reasoning and tool use.

Method: Extreme decomposition of tasks into subtasks handled by focused microagents, combined with efficient multi-agent voting scheme for error correction at each step.

Result: Successfully solved tasks with over one million LLM steps with zero errors, demonstrating scalability far beyond current LLM capabilities.

Conclusion: Massively decomposed agentic processes (MDAPs) provide an efficient pathway to solve organizational and societal-level problems, rather than relying solely on continual LLM improvement.

Abstract: LLMs have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in reasoning, insights, and tool use, but chaining these abilities into extended processes at the scale of those routinely executed by humans, organizations, and societies has remained out of reach. The models have a persistent error rate that prevents scale-up: for instance, recent experiments in the Towers of Hanoi benchmark domain showed that the process inevitably becomes derailed after at most a few hundred steps. Thus, although LLM research is often still benchmarked on tasks with relatively few dependent logical steps, there is increasing attention on the ability (or inability) of LLMs to perform long range tasks. This paper describes MAKER, the first system that successfully solves a task with over one million LLM steps with zero errors, and, in principle, scales far beyond this level. The approach relies on an extreme decomposition of a task into subtasks, each of which can be tackled by focused microagents. The high level of modularity resulting from the decomposition allows error correction to be applied at each step through an efficient multi-agent voting scheme. This combination of extreme decomposition and error correction makes scaling possible. Thus, the results suggest that instead of relying on continual improvement of current LLMs, massively decomposed agentic processes (MDAPs) may provide a way to efficiently solve problems at the level of organizations and societies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving systems face diverse driving hazards that can compromise safety and degrade performance, creating a need for resilience capabilities to monitor hazards and respond to safety violations.

Method: Argus continuously monitors ADS-generated trajectories for potential hazards and seamlessly takes control through a hazard mitigator when the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe.

Result: Integration with three state-of-the-art ADSs (TCP, UniAD, VAD) showed Argus improves driving scores by up to 150.30% on average, prevents up to 64.38% of violations, with minimal time overhead.

Conclusion: Argus effectively enhances ADS resilience by mitigating driving hazards and preventing safety violations while maintaining driving performance with little additional computational cost.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems (ADSs), with their strong capabilities in environmental perception and generalizable driving decisions, are attracting growing attention from both academia and industry. However, once deployed on public roads, ADSs are inevitably exposed to diverse driving hazards that may compromise safety and degrade system performance. This raises a strong demand for resilience of ADSs, particularly the capability to continuously monitor driving hazards and adaptively respond to potential safety violations, which is crucial for maintaining robust driving behaviors in complex driving scenarios.
  To bridge this gap, we propose a runtime resilience-oriented framework, Argus, to mitigate the driving hazards, thus preventing potential safety violations and improving the driving performance of an ADS. Argus continuously monitors the trajectories generated by the ADS for potential hazards and, whenever the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe, seamlessly takes control through a hazard mitigator. We integrate Argus with three state-of-the-art end-to-end ADSs, i.e., TCP, UniAD and VAD. Our evaluation has demonstrated that Argus effectively and efficiently enhances the resilience of ADSs, improving the driving score of the ADS by up to 150.30% on average, and preventing up to 64.38% of the violations, with little additional time overhead.

Result: Provides a critical framework for understanding next-generation autonomous emergency response systems from a Generative AI perspective.

Conclusion: DM-augmented RL and LLM-assisted ICL represent promising approaches to overcome conventional RL limitations for AV emergency response optimization.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are poised to revolutionize emergency services by enabling faster, safer, and more efficient responses. This transformation is driven by advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL), which allows AVs to navigate complex environments and make critical decisions in real time. However, conventional RL paradigms often suffer from poor sample efficiency and lack adaptability in dynamic emergency scenarios. This paper reviews next-generation AV optimization strategies to address these limitations. We analyze the shift from conventional RL to Diffusion Model (DM)-augmented RL, which enhances policy robustness through synthetic data generation, albeit with increased computational cost. Additionally, we explore the emerging paradigm of Large Language Model (LLM)-assisted In-Context Learning (ICL), which offers a lightweight and interpretable alternative by enabling rapid, on-the-fly adaptation without retraining. By reviewing the state of the art in AV intelligence, DM-augmented RL, and LLM-assisted ICL, this paper provides a critical framework for understanding the next generation of autonomous emergency response systems from a Generative AI perspective.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OR-R1 is a data-efficient framework for automated optimization modeling and solving that achieves state-of-the-art performance using only 1/10 the data of prior methods, with a two-stage training approach combining supervised fine-tuning and test-time reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based methods for translating natural language optimization problems into formal models require vast amounts of annotated data, creating high costs and scalability barriers. There's a need for more data-efficient approaches to lower expertise requirements for OR applications.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with limited labeled data to learn reasoning patterns, 2) Test-Time Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO) using abundant unlabeled data to improve capability and consistency.

Result: Achieves 67.7% average solving accuracy, outperforming ORLM by up to 4.2% with only 1/10 the synthetic data. With just 100 samples, beats ORLM by over 2.4%. TGRPO provides additional 3.1%-6.4% improvement and reduces Pass@1 vs Pass@8 gap from 13% to 7%.

Conclusion: OR-R1 provides a robust, scalable, and cost-effective solution for automated OR optimization, significantly lowering both expertise and data barriers for industrial applications.

Abstract: Optimization modeling and solving are fundamental to the application of Operations Research (OR) in real-world decision making, yet the process of translating natural language problem descriptions into formal models and solver code remains highly expertise intensive. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new opportunities for automation, the generalization ability and data efficiency of existing LLM-based methods are still limited, asmost require vast amounts of annotated or synthetic data, resulting in high costs and scalability barriers. In this work, we present OR-R1, a data-efficient training framework for automated optimization modeling and solving. OR-R1 first employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to help the model acquire the essential reasoning patterns for problem formulation and code generation from limited labeled data. In addition, it improves the capability and consistency through Test-Time Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO). This two-stage design enables OR-R1 to leverage both scarce labeled and abundant unlabeled data for effective learning. Experiments show that OR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average solving accuracy of $67.7\%$, using only $1/10$ the synthetic data required by prior methods such as ORLM, exceeding ORLM's solving accuracy by up to $4.2\%$. Remarkably, OR-R1 outperforms ORLM by over $2.4\%$ with just $100$ synthetic samples. Furthermore, TGRPO contributes an additional $3.1\%-6.4\%$ improvement in accuracy, significantly narrowing the gap between single-attempt (Pass@1) and multi-attempt (Pass@8) performance from $13\%$ to $7\%$. Extensive evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that OR-R1 provides a robust, scalable, and cost-effective solution for automated OR optimization problem modeling and solving, lowering the expertise and data barriers for industrial OR applications.

*Ziwei Wang,Leyang Yang,Xiaoxuan Tang,Sheng Zhou,Dajun Chen,Wei Jiang,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a History-Aware Reasoning (HAR) framework to enhance GUI agents' episodic reasoning by improving short-term memory and historical interaction awareness in long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GUI agents have weak short-term memory and treat historical interactions as discrete screens rather than connected episodes, limiting their performance in complex GUI automation tasks.

Method: Developed HAR framework with reflective learning scenarios, tailored correction guidelines, and hybrid RL reward function to enhance episodic reasoning and short-term memory.

Result: Created HAR-GUI-3B model that transforms reasoning from history-agnostic to history-aware, demonstrating effectiveness across multiple GUI benchmarks with improved performance.

Conclusion: The HAR framework successfully equips GUI agents with stable short-term memory and reliable screen perception, addressing the history-agnostic reasoning limitation in current methods.

Abstract: Advances in Multimodal Large Language Models have significantly enhanced Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation. Equipping GUI agents with reliable episodic reasoning capabilities is essential for bridging the gap between users' concise task descriptions and the complexities of real-world execution. Current methods integrate Reinforcement Learning (RL) with System-2 Chain-of-Thought, yielding notable gains in reasoning enhancement. For long-horizon GUI tasks, historical interactions connect each screen to the goal-oriented episode chain, and effectively leveraging these clues is crucial for the current decision. However, existing native GUI agents exhibit weak short-term memory in their explicit reasoning, interpreting the chained interactions as discrete screen understanding, i.e., unawareness of the historical interactions within the episode. This history-agnostic reasoning challenges their performance in GUI automation. To alleviate this weakness, we propose a History-Aware Reasoning (HAR) framework, which encourages an agent to reflect on its own errors and acquire episodic reasoning knowledge from them via tailored strategies that enhance short-term memory in long-horizon interaction. The framework mainly comprises constructing a reflective learning scenario, synthesizing tailored correction guidelines, and designing a hybrid RL reward function. Using the HAR framework, we develop a native end-to-end model, HAR-GUI-3B, which alters the inherent reasoning mode from history-agnostic to history-aware, equipping the GUI agent with stable short-term memory and reliable perception of screen details. Comprehensive evaluations across a range of GUI-related benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method.

Method: Created ProBench with 200+ mobile GUI tasks, extended evaluation to include Process-related Tasks with a Process Provider that automatically supplies accurate process information for precise assessment.

Result: Evaluation revealed significant limitations in advanced GUI agents for real-world scenarios, with shortcomings prevalent across both large generalist models and smaller GUI-specific models.

Conclusion: Detailed error analysis exposed universal problems in current GUI agents, providing concrete directions for future improvements in GUI agent development.

Abstract: With the deep integration of artificial intelligence and interactive technology, Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agent, as the carrier connecting goal-oriented natural language and real-world devices, has received widespread attention from the community. Contemporary benchmarks aim to evaluate the comprehensive capabilities of GUI agents in GUI operation tasks, generally determining task completion solely by inspecting the final screen state. However, GUI operation tasks consist of multiple chained steps while not all critical information is presented in the final few pages. Although a few research has begun to incorporate intermediate steps into evaluation, accurately and automatically capturing this process information still remains an open challenge. To address this weakness, we introduce ProBench, a comprehensive mobile benchmark with over 200 challenging GUI tasks covering widely-used scenarios. Remaining the traditional State-related Task evaluation, we extend our dataset to include Process-related Task and design a specialized evaluation method. A newly introduced Process Provider automatically supplies accurate process information, enabling presice assessment of agent's performance. Our evaluation of advanced GUI agents reveals significant limitations for real-world GUI scenarios. These shortcomings are prevalent across diverse models, including both large-scale generalist models and smaller, GUI-specific models. A detailed error analysis further exposes several universal problems, outlining concrete directions for future improvements.

### [206] [Efficient Reasoning via Reward Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09158)
*Yuhao Wang,Xiaopeng Li,Cheng Gong,Ziru Liu,Suiyun Zhang,Rui Liu,Xiangyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Conciseness Reward Model (CRM) and Conciseness Reward Function (CRF) to address overthinking in large reasoning models, improving both accuracy and token efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 generate verbose responses with redundant reasoning steps (overthinking), increasing computational costs. Existing length penalty methods suffer from length collapse and training collapse issues.

Method: Developed a pipeline for training Conciseness Reward Model (CRM) that scores reasoning path conciseness, and introduced Conciseness Reward Function (CRF) with explicit dependency between outcome reward and conciseness score.

Result: Achieved 8.1% accuracy improvement and 19.9% reduction in response token length on Qwen2.5-7B across five mathematical benchmarks. Method generalizes well to other LLMs including Llama and Mistral.

Conclusion: The proposed CRM and CRF effectively mitigate overthinking in large reasoning models, providing both theoretical advantages (variance reduction, improved convergence) and practical benefits (higher accuracy, reduced computational costs).

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling the development of large reasoning models (LRMs). However, LRMs such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 often generate verbose responses containing redundant or irrelevant reasoning step-a phenomenon known as overthinking-which substantially increases computational costs. Prior efforts to mitigate this issue commonly incorporate length penalties into the reward function, but we find they frequently suffer from two critical issues: length collapse and training collapse, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address them, we propose a pipeline for training a Conciseness Reward Model (CRM) that scores the conciseness of reasoning path. Additionally, we introduce a novel reward formulation named Conciseness Reward Function (CRF) with explicit dependency between the outcome reward and conciseness score, thereby fostering both more effective and more efficient reasoning. From a theoretical standpoint, we demonstrate the superiority of the new reward from the perspective of variance reduction and improved convergence properties. Besides, on the practical side, extensive experiments on five mathematical benchmark datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and token efficiency, which achieves an 8.1% accuracy improvement and a 19.9% reduction in response token length on Qwen2.5-7B. Furthermore, the method generalizes well to other LLMs including Llama and Mistral. The implementation code and datasets are publicly available for reproduction: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CRM.

*Niclas Flehmig,Mary Ann Lundteigen,Shen Yin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a two-layered reliability monitoring framework for agentic AI systems to address reliability challenges during operation, combining out-of-distribution detection and AI transparency layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic AI systems have insufficient reliability for high-risk domains like healthcare and process industry, posing risks from unexpected behavior during operation.

Method: A two-layered reliability monitoring framework consisting of: 1) out-of-distribution detection layer for novel inputs, and 2) AI transparency layer to reveal internal operations.

Result: The framework provides human operators with decision support to identify potentially unreliable outputs and intervene when necessary.

Conclusion: This monitoring approach provides a foundation for developing mitigation techniques to reduce risks from uncertain reliability during operation of agentic AI systems.

Abstract: The implementation of agentic AI systems has the potential of providing more helpful AI systems in a variety of applications. These systems work autonomously towards a defined goal with reduced external control. Despite their potential, one of their flaws is the insufficient reliability which makes them especially unsuitable for high-risk domains such as healthcare or process industry. Unreliable systems pose a risk in terms of unexpected behavior during operation and mitigation techniques are needed. In this work, we derive the main reliability challenges of agentic AI systems during operation based on their characteristics. We draw the connection to traditional AI systems and formulate a fundamental reliability challenge during operation which is inherent to traditional and agentic AI systems. As our main contribution, we propose a two-layered reliability monitoring framework for agentic AI systems which consists of a out-of-distribution detection layer for novel inputs and AI transparency layer to reveal internal operations. This two-layered monitoring approach gives a human operator the decision support which is needed to decide whether an output is potential unreliable or not and intervene. This framework provides a foundation for developing mitigation techniques to reduce risk stemming from uncertain reliability during operation.

### [208] [MedFuse: Multiplicative Embedding Fusion For Irregular Clinical Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09247)
*Yi-Hsien Hsieh,Ta-Jung Chien,Chun-Kai Huang,Shao-Hua Sun,Che Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MedFuse is a framework for irregular clinical time series that uses multiplicative fusion (MuFuse) to better capture value-dependent feature interactions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on predictive tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical time series from EHRs are irregular with asynchronous sampling, missing values, and heterogeneous dynamics. Existing embedding strategies use additive operations that limit their ability to capture value-dependent feature interactions.

Method: Proposed MedFuse framework with MuFuse module that fuses value and feature embeddings through multiplicative modulation, preserving feature-specific information while modeling higher-order dependencies across features.

Result: Experiments on three real-world datasets covering intensive and chronic care show MedFuse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on key predictive tasks. Learned representations demonstrate enhanced expressiveness and support cross-dataset pretraining.

Conclusion: MedFuse establishes a generalizable approach for modeling irregular clinical time series through multiplicative fusion that improves feature interaction modeling.

Abstract: Clinical time series derived from electronic health records (EHRs) are inherently irregular, with asynchronous sampling, missing values, and heterogeneous feature dynamics. While numerical laboratory measurements are highly informative, existing embedding strategies usually combine feature identity and value embeddings through additive operations, which constrains their ability to capture value-dependent feature interactions. We propose MedFuse, a framework for irregular clinical time series centered on the MuFuse (Multiplicative Embedding Fusion) module. MuFuse fuses value and feature embeddings through multiplicative modulation, preserving feature-specific information while modeling higher-order dependencies across features. Experiments on three real-world datasets covering both intensive and chronic care show that MedFuse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on key predictive tasks. Analysis of the learned representations further demonstrates that multiplicative fusion enhances expressiveness and supports cross-dataset pretraining. These results establish MedFuse as a generalizable approach for modeling irregular clinical time series.

*Minlan Shao,Zijian Zhang,Yili Wang,Yiwei Dai,Xu Shen,Xin Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HyperD is a novel traffic forecasting framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components using hybrid periodic representations and frequency-aware modeling to handle complex spatial-temporal dependencies and multi-scale patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traffic forecasting is challenging due to complex spatial dependencies from road network interactions and the coexistence of multi-scale periodic patterns with irregular fluctuations from unpredictable events like accidents and weather.

Method: Proposes HyperD framework with: 1) Hybrid Periodic Representation Module using learnable periodic embeddings and spatial-temporal attention for daily/weekly patterns, 2) Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module using complex-valued MLP in frequency domain for non-periodic fluctuations, and 3) Dual-View Alignment Loss to enforce semantic separation between components.

Result: Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets show HyperD achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, superior robustness under disturbances, and improved computational efficiency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: HyperD effectively addresses traffic forecasting challenges by decoupling periodic and residual components, demonstrating strong performance, robustness, and efficiency across multiple real-world datasets.

Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting plays a vital role in intelligent transportation systems, enabling applications such as congestion control, route planning, and urban mobility optimization.However, traffic forecasting remains challenging due to two key factors: (1) complex spatial dependencies arising from dynamic interactions between road segments and traffic sensors across the network, and (2) the coexistence of multi-scale periodic patterns (e.g., daily and weekly periodic patterns driven by human routines) with irregular fluctuations caused by unpredictable events (e.g., accidents, weather, or construction). To tackle these challenges, we propose HyperD (Hybrid Periodic Decoupling), a novel framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components. The periodic component is handled by the Hybrid Periodic Representation Module, which extracts fine-grained daily and weekly patterns using learnable periodic embeddings and spatial-temporal attention. The residual component, which captures non-periodic, high-frequency fluctuations, is modeled by the Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module, leveraging complex-valued MLP in frequency domain. To enforce semantic separation between the two components, we further introduce a Dual-View Alignment Loss, which aligns low-frequency information with the periodic branch and high-frequency information with the residual branch. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that HyperD achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, while offering superior robustness under disturbances and improved computational efficiency compared to existing methods.

*Roland Aydin,Christian Cyron,Steve Bachelor,Ashton Anderson,Robert West*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes shifting from traditional AI training to 'model raising' where alignment is integrated from the start through redesigned training corpora focused on first-person perspective, lived experience, social interactions, and scaffolded data ordering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI training methods align models with human values only after core capabilities are established, resulting in easily misaligned models lacking deep-rooted value systems.

Method: Redesign training corpus with four key components: reframing data from first-person perspective, recontextualizing information as lived experience, simulating social interactions, and scaffolding the ordering of training data.

Result: Expected to lead to early commitment to values from the first training token onward, making knowledge, skills, and values intrinsically harder to separate.

Conclusion: This paradigm shift from 'model training' to 'model raising' is critical as LLM capabilities increasingly overtake human capabilities in many tasks.

Abstract: Current AI training methods align models with human values only after their core capabilities have been established, resulting in models that are easily misaligned and lack deep-rooted value systems. We propose a paradigm shift from "model training" to "model raising", in which alignment is woven into a model's development from the start. We identify several key components for this paradigm, all centered around redesigning the training corpus: reframing training data from a first-person perspective, recontextualizing information as lived experience, simulating social interactions, and scaffolding the ordering of training data. We expect that this redesign of the training corpus will lead to an early commitment to values from the first training token onward, such that knowledge, skills, and values are intrinsically much harder to separate. In an ecosystem in which large language model capabilities start overtaking human capabilities in many tasks, this seems to us like a critical need.

*Stine Beltoft,Lukas Galke*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI has advanced quantitative research but neglected qualitative methods, creating a need for dedicated qualitative AI systems that are transparent, reproducible, and privacy-friendly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Qualitative research lags behind in AI adoption, forcing researchers to use general-purpose tools like ChatGPT despite their limitations (biased, opaque, irreproducible, privacy-compromising), creating a critical gap in scientific discovery.

Method: Argue for developing dedicated qualitative AI systems from the ground up for interpretive research, and review literature to show how existing automated discovery pipelines could be enhanced with qualitative capabilities.

Result: Identified key opportunities where safe qualitative AI could advance multidisciplinary and mixed-methods research by integrating qualitative dimensions essential for meaning-making.

Conclusion: There is an urgent need to develop specialized qualitative AI systems that address the unique requirements of interpretive research while maintaining transparency, reproducibility, and privacy protection.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLM) are reshaping science, with most recent advances culminating in fully-automated scientific discovery pipelines. But qualitative research has been left behind. Researchers in qualitative methods are hesitant about AI adoption. Yet when they are willing to use AI at all, they have little choice but to rely on general-purpose tools like ChatGPT to assist with interview interpretation, data annotation, and topic modeling - while simultaneously acknowledging these system's well-known limitations of being biased, opaque, irreproducible, and privacy-compromising. This creates a critical gap: while AI has substantially advanced quantitative methods, the qualitative dimensions essential for meaning-making and comprehensive scientific understanding remain poorly integrated. We argue for developing dedicated qualitative AI systems built from the ground up for interpretive research. Such systems must be transparent, reproducible, and privacy-friendly. We review recent literature to show how existing automated discovery pipelines could be enhanced by robust qualitative capabilities, and identify key opportunities where safe qualitative AI could advance multidisciplinary and mixed-methods research.

TL;DR: LLM-based agentic framework for synthesizing barrier certificates in dynamical systems, achieving over 90% success rate on a new benchmark of 100 systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current barrier certificate synthesis methods suffer from poor scalability, template dependence, and require substantial manual expertise that relies on linguistic reasoning rather than formalized methods.

Method: LLM-based agentic framework using natural language reasoning to propose, refine, and validate candidate certificates, integrating LLM-driven template discovery with SMT-based verification, and supporting barrier-controller co-synthesis.

Result: Achieves over 90% success rate in generating valid certificates across BarrierBench (100 dynamical systems spanning linear, nonlinear, discrete-time, and continuous-time settings).

Conclusion: Demonstrates that expert reasoning in barrier certificate synthesis can be captured and operationalized by language models, establishing a foundation for integrating language-based reasoning with formal verification.

Abstract: Safety verification of dynamical systems via barrier certificates is essential for ensuring correctness in autonomous applications. Synthesizing these certificates involves discovering mathematical functions with current methods suffering from poor scalability, dependence on carefully designed templates, and exhaustive or incremental function-space searches. They also demand substantial manual expertise--selecting templates, solvers, and hyperparameters, and designing sampling strategies--requiring both theoretical and practical knowledge traditionally shared through linguistic reasoning rather than formalized methods.
  This motivates a key question: can such expert reasoning be captured and operationalized by language models? We address this by introducing an LLM-based agentic framework for barrier certificate synthesis. The framework uses natural language reasoning to propose, refine, and validate candidate certificates, integrating LLM-driven template discovery with SMT-based verification, and supporting barrier-controller co-synthesis to ensure consistency between safety certificates and controllers.
  To evaluate this capability, we introduce BarrierBench, a benchmark of 100 dynamical systems spanning linear, nonlinear, discrete-time, and continuous-time settings. Our experiments assess not only the effectiveness of LLM-guided barrier synthesis but also the utility of retrieval-augmented generation and agentic coordination strategies in improving its reliability and performance. Across these tasks, the framework achieves more than 90% success in generating valid certificates. By releasing BarrierBench and the accompanying toolchain, we aim to establish a community testbed for advancing the integration of language-based reasoning with formal verification in dynamical systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Evaluation of 2025 frontier LLMs (DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5) on PDDL planning tasks shows GPT-5 competitive with LAMA planner on standard domains, with improved reasoning capabilities over previous LLM generations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the current reasoning capabilities of frontier LLMs in automated planning tasks and compare their performance against traditional planners like LAMA.

Method: Evaluated three frontier LLMs (DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5) on PDDL domain and task descriptions from International Planning Competition domains, including obfuscated versions to test pure reasoning.

Result: GPT-5 performed competitively with LAMA planner on standard PDDL domains. All LLMs showed performance degradation on obfuscated tasks but less severe than previous models, indicating substantial improvements over prior LLM generations.

Conclusion: Frontier LLMs have significantly reduced the performance gap with traditional planners on challenging planning benchmarks, showing substantial reasoning capability improvements.

Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning remains an active area of research, with the capabilities of frontier models continually advancing. We provide an updated evaluation of the end-to-end planning performance of three frontier LLMs as of 2025, where models are prompted to generate a plan from PDDL domain and task descriptions. We evaluate DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5 and as reference the planner LAMA on a subset of domains from the most recent Learning Track of the International Planning Competition. Our results show that on standard PDDL domains, the performance of GPT-5 in terms of solved tasks is competitive with LAMA. When the PDDL domains and tasks are obfuscated to test for pure reasoning, the performance of all LLMs degrades, though less severely than previously reported for other models. These results show substantial improvements over prior generations of LLMs, reducing the performance gap to planners on a challenging benchmark.

Motivation: To enable scientific discovery by accessing meaningful features in high-dimensional learned representations and analyzing what information is not captured or considered.

Method: Latent flow matching with classifier-free guidance that explicitly separates conditioning information from residual representations in latent subspaces.

Result: Successfully demonstrated across three experiments (2D Gaussian, colored MNIST, Galaxy10) that the method enables access to meaningful features in high-dimensional data.

Conclusion: Provides a simple yet powerful mechanism for analyzing, controlling, and repurposing latent representations, enabling scientific exploration of uncaptured information.

Abstract: Accessing information in learned representations is critical for scientific discovery in high-dimensional domains. We introduce a novel method based on latent flow matching with classifier-free guidance that disentangles latent subspaces by explicitly separating information included in conditioning from information that remains in the residual representation. Across three experiments -- a synthetic 2D Gaussian toy problem, colored MNIST, and the Galaxy10 astronomy dataset -- we show that our method enables access to meaningful features of high dimensional data. Our results highlight a simple yet powerful mechanism for analyzing, controlling, and repurposing latent representations, providing a pathway toward using generative models for scientific exploration of what we don't capture, consider, or catalog.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CrochetBench is a benchmark for evaluating multimodal models' ability to perform fine-grained procedural reasoning in crochet, focusing on executable correctness rather than surface-level understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior benchmarks focus on high-level description or visual QA, but there's a need to assess models' ability to actually perform tasks - shifting from describing to doing in procedural domains like crochet.

Method: Uses CrochetPARADE DSL as intermediate representation for structural validation and functional evaluation via execution. Covers stitch classification, instruction grounding, and natural language/image-to-DSL translation tasks.

Result: Performance sharply declines when evaluation shifts from surface-level similarity to executable correctness, exposing limitations in long-range symbolic reasoning and 3D-aware procedural synthesis.

Conclusion: CrochetBench provides a new way to assess procedural competence in multimodal models and highlights the gap between surface-level understanding and executable precision in real-world creative domains.

Abstract: We present CrochetBench, a benchmark for evaluating the ability of multimodal large language models to perform fine-grained, low-level procedural reasoning in the domain of crochet. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on high-level description or visual question answering, CrochetBench shifts the emphasis from describing to doing: models are required to recognize stitches, select structurally appropriate instructions, and generate compilable crochet procedures. We adopt the CrochetPARADE DSL as our intermediate representation, enabling structural validation and functional evaluation via execution. The benchmark covers tasks including stitch classification, instruction grounding, and both natural language and image-to-DSL translation. Across all tasks, performance sharply declines as the evaluation shifts from surface-level similarity to executable correctness, exposing limitations in long-range symbolic reasoning and 3D-aware procedural synthesis. CrochetBench offers a new lens for assessing procedural competence in multimodal models and highlights the gap between surface-level understanding and executable precision in real-world creative domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A consensus sampling algorithm that aggregates multiple generative models to achieve safety competitive with the safest subset, while abstaining when models disagree.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many AI safety approaches rely on inspecting model outputs, but some risks are undetectable by inspection alone. This work provides a complementary, architecture-agnostic safety enhancement method.

Method: Proposes a consensus sampling algorithm that uses k models and achieves risk competitive with the average risk of the safest s models, while abstaining when there's insufficient agreement. Leverages models' ability to compute output probabilities.

Result: The algorithm bounds the probability of abstention when sufficiently many models are safe and exhibit adequate agreement. It inherits safety from the safest subset of models.

Conclusion: Provides a new model-agnostic approach for AI safety by amplifying safety guarantees from an unknown subset of models within a collection to create a single reliable model.

Abstract: Many approaches to AI safety rely on inspecting model outputs or activations, yet certain risks are inherently undetectable by inspection alone. We propose a complementary, architecture-agnostic approach that enhances safety through the aggregation of multiple generative models, with the aggregated model inheriting its safety from the safest subset of a given size among them. Specifically, we present a consensus sampling algorithm that, given $k$ models and a prompt, achieves risk competitive with the average risk of the safest $s$ of the $k$ models, where $s$ is a chosen parameter, while abstaining when there is insufficient agreement between them. The approach leverages the models' ability to compute output probabilities, and we bound the probability of abstention when sufficiently many models are safe and exhibit adequate agreement. The algorithm is inspired by the provable copyright protection algorithm of Vyas et al. (2023). It requires some overlap among safe models, offers no protection when all models are unsafe, and may accumulate risk over repeated use. Nonetheless, our results provide a new, model-agnostic approach for AI safety by amplifying safety guarantees from an unknown subset of models within a collection to that of a single reliable model.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a theoretical foundation that describes physical embodiment, sensory perception, action ability, learning processes, and context sensitivity of intelligent systems within a coherent framework, moving beyond classical symbolic AI approaches.

Method: Proposes six fundamental principles forming a closed control loop where energy, information, control, and context constantly interact. Learning is framed as structural coupling changes between agents and environment, illustrated through a practical rehabilitation robot scenario.

Result: Establishes that physical intelligence emerges from real interaction between body, environment, and experience, generating meaning through physical experience rather than databases, representing a paradigm shift in understanding intelligence.

Conclusion: Physical AI understands intelligence as an emergent phenomenon of embodied physical processes, where the six fundamentals interact as a coherent system enabling meaning generation through immediate physical experience rather than abstract calculation.

Abstract: This work will elaborate the fundamental principles of physical artificial intelligence (Physical AI) from a scientific and systemic perspective. The aim is to create a theoretical foundation that describes the physical embodiment, sensory perception, ability to act, learning processes, and context sensitivity of intelligent systems within a coherent framework. While classical AI approaches rely on symbolic processing and data driven models, Physical AI understands intelligence as an emergent phenomenon of real interaction between body, environment, and experience. The six fundamentals presented here are embodiment, sensory perception, motor action, learning, autonomy, and context sensitivity, and form the conceptual basis for designing and evaluating physically intelligent systems. Theoretically, it is shown that these six principles do not represent loose functional modules but rather act as a closed control loop in which energy, information, control, and context are in constant interaction. This circular interaction enables a system to generate meaning not from databases, but from physical experience, a paradigm shift that understands intelligence as an physical embodied process. Physical AI understands learning not as parameter adjustment, but as a change in the structural coupling between agents and the environment. To illustrate this, the theoretical model is explained using a practical scenario: An adaptive assistant robot supports patients in a rehabilitation clinic. This example illustrates that physical intelligence does not arise from abstract calculation, but from immediate, embodied experience. It shows how the six fundamentals interact in a real system: embodiment as a prerequisite, perception as input, movement as expression, learning as adaptation, autonomy as regulation, and context as orientation.

TL;DR: A dual-hop wireless network with hybrid FSO/THz first hop and aerial RIS-based RF second hop shows 52.54% performance improvement over traditional RF-FSO systems, with aerial RIS providing additional 41.39% enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance backhaul communication performance in 6G networks by leveraging RIS capabilities to intelligently control electromagnetic wave propagation and improve system reliability.

Method: Proposed dual-hop wireless network with hybrid FSO/THz first hop and aerial RIS-based RF second hop; compared hard vs soft switching strategies; derived closed-form expressions for outage probability and bit error rate; performed asymptotic analysis for high SNR conditions.

Result: 52.54% performance improvement over traditional RF-FSO framework; 41.39% additional enhancement from aerial RIS integration; optimal aerial RIS placement at lower altitude with equal, shorter distance from both endpoints; validated through Monte Carlo simulation.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid model with aerial RIS significantly outperforms traditional approaches, with strategic RIS placement being crucial for optimal performance in 6G wireless networks.

Abstract: In the context of emerging sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are gaining prominence for their ability to intelligently control electromagnetic wave propagation and enhance backhaul communication performance. In this paper, we propose a novel dual-hop wireless network, where the first hop consists of a hybrid free-space optics (FSO) / terahertz (THz) link, and the second hop incorporates an aerial RIS-based radio frequency (RF) link. To provide a comprehensive performance evaluation, a comparative analysis of two switching strategies is conducted: (1) hard switching and (2) soft switching. Novel closed-form expressions are derived for key performance metrics, including outage probability and bit error rate. These expressions are then utilized to investigate the impact of various system parameters. Our proposed hybrid model demonstrates a 52.54% performance improvement over the traditional RF-FSO framework. Moreover, the integration of an aerial RIS in the second hop enhances system performance by 41.39%. Numerical findings suggest that strategically placing the aerial RIS at a lower altitude and maintaining an equal, shorter distance from both communication endpoints significantly improves overall system performance. To analyze the response under high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, asymptotic analysis is performed, and the diversity order of the system is determined. Finally, the analytical results are validated through a Monte Carlo simulation.

*Gil Cohen,Dean Doron,Noam Goldgraber,Tomer Manket*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper analyzes trace-of-algebraic geometry (TAG) codes as a method to approach the Gilbert-Varshamov bound for binary codes, using algebraic structure throughout the alphabet reduction process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage algebraic geometry codes that beat the GV bound over constant-sized fields and see if their advantage persists when taking traces to binary fields, avoiding the parameter loss issues of traditional concatenation methods.

Method: Using trace-of-AG codes with a new Hasse-Weil-type theorem specifically designed for analyzing TAG codes, which provides better estimates than classical approaches.

Result: The analysis shows that while TAG codes don't currently yield improved constructions, a constant-factor strengthening of the bound would suffice. In high-distance regimes, TAG codes are inferior to code concatenation.

Conclusion: The new Hasse-Weil-type theorem holds in greater generality than needed for TAG codes and provides new estimates for exponential sums, offering a promising algebraic approach to alphabet reduction.

Abstract: One of the oldest problems in coding theory is to match the Gilbert-Varshamov bound with explicit binary codes. Over larger-yet still constant-sized-fields, algebraic-geometry codes are known to beat the GV bound. In this work, we leverage this phenomenon by taking traces of AG codes. Our hope is that the margin by which AG codes exceed the GV bound will withstand the parameter loss incurred by taking the trace from a constant field extension to the binary field. In contrast to concatenation, the usual alphabet-reduction method, our analysis of trace-of-AG (TAG) codes uses the AG codes' algebraic structure throughout - including in the alphabet-reduction step.
  Our main technical contribution is a Hasse-Weil-type theorem that is well-suited for the analysis of TAG codes. The classical theorem (and its Grothendieck trace-formula extension) are inadequate in this setting. Although we do not obtain improved constructions, we show that a constant-factor strengthening of our bound would suffice. We also analyze the limitations of TAG codes under our bound and prove that, in the high-distance regime, they are inferior to code concatenation. Our Hasse-Weil-type theorem holds in far greater generality than is needed for analyzing TAG codes. In particular, we derive new estimates for exponential sums.

Motivation: To develop an efficient decoder for short block codes that achieves near maximum-likelihood performance without requiring Gaussian elimination, addressing complexity issues in existing methods like ordered statistics decoding.

Method: Uses Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by a neural network policy to search for test error patterns in received information bits, obtaining codeword candidates through re-encoding. The trained policy minimizes search steps from the root node.

Result: Achieves near maximum-likelihood decoding performance with 95% complexity reduction compared to non-GE OSD, and lower decoding latency than both OSD and non-GE OSD at high SNRs.

Conclusion: The policy-guided MCTS decoder provides an effective alternative to OSD methods, achieving high performance without Gaussian elimination while significantly reducing computational complexity and latency.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a policy-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) decoder that achieves near maximum-likelihood decoding (MLD) performance for short block codes. The MCTS decoder searches for test error patterns (TEPs) in the received information bits and obtains codeword candidates through re-encoding. The TEP search is executed on a tree structure, guided by a neural network policy trained via MCTS-based learning. The trained policy guides the decoder to find the correct TEPs with minimal steps from the root node (all-zero TEP). The decoder outputs the codeword with maximum likelihood when the early stopping criterion is satisfied. The proposed method requires no Gaussian elimination (GE) compared to ordered statistics decoding (OSD) and can reduce search complexity by 95\% compared to non-GE OSD. It achieves lower decoding latency than both OSD and non-GE OSD at high SNRs.

*Wing Shing Wong,Chung Shue Chen,Yuan-Hsun Lo*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper proposes multiset coding for scenarios where symbol order cannot be maintained, using a sunmao construction method to decompose grids into sub-grids and assemble solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by moving object tracking in sensor networks and applications where symbol order cannot be observed or maintained.

Method: Sunmao construction: decomposing source data grids into sub-grids, solving coding problems for each sub-grid, and piecing together solutions. Braid codes are specific implementations of this approach.

Result: Braid codes are easy to define for multi-dimensional grids, have asymptotic optimal coding efficiency measured by distinct symbols required, and possess inherent error correction properties.

Conclusion: The sunmao construction provides an effective framework for multiset coding, with braid codes demonstrating both efficiency and error correction capabilities.

Abstract: We present results on coding using multisets instead of ordered sequences. The study is motivated by a moving object tracking problem in a sensor network and can find applications in settings where the order of the symbols in a codeword cannot be maintained or observed. In this paper a multiset coding scheme is proposed on source data that can be organized as a flat or cyclic multi-dimensional integer lattice (grid). A fundamental idea in the solution approach is to decompose the original source data grid into sub-grids. The original multiset coding problem can then be restricted to each of the sub-grid. Solutions for the sub-grids are subsequently piece together to form the desired solution. We name this circle of idea as sunmao construction in reference to woodwork construction method with ancient origin. Braid codes are specific solutions defined using the sunmao construction. They are easy to define for multi-dimensional grids. Moreover for a code of a given code set size and multiset cardinality, if we measure coding efficiency by the number of distinct symbols required, then braid codes have asymptotic order equal to those that are optimal. We also show that braid codes have interesting inherent error correction properties.

*Vukan Ninkovic,Dejan Vukobratovic*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: A two-stage training method for autoencoder-based error correcting codes that learns optimal binary codes without gradient approximation, achieving Hamming code performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of enforcing binary codewords in differentiable autoencoder architectures, which breaks gradient flow and causes unstable convergence.

Method: A simplified two-stage training procedure: continuous pretraining phase followed by direct binarization and fine-tuning without gradient approximation techniques.

Result: For (7,4) block configuration over BSC, the learned encoder-decoder pair discovers a rotated version (coset code) of the optimal Hamming code, achieving the same BLER with ML decoding.

Conclusion: Compact AE architectures can effectively learn structured, algebraically optimal binary codes through stable and straightforward training.

Abstract: Error correcting codes play a central role in digital communication, ensuring that transmitted information can be accurately reconstructed despite channel impairments. Recently, autoencoder (AE) based approaches have gained attention for the end-to-end design of communication systems, offering a data driven alternative to conventional coding schemes. However, enforcing binary codewords within differentiable AE architectures remains difficult, as discretization breaks gradient flow and often leads to unstable convergence. To overcome this limitation, a simplified two stage training procedure is proposed, consisting of a continuous pretraining phase followed by direct binarization and fine tuning without gradient approximation techniques. For the (7,4) block configuration over a binary symmetric channel (BSC), the learned encoder-decoder pair learns a rotated version (coset code) of the optimal Hamming code, naturally recovering its linear and distance properties and thereby achieving the same block error rate (BLER) with maximum likelihood (ML) decoding. These results indicate that compact AE architectures can effectively learn structured, algebraically optimal binary codes through stable and straightforward training.

### [223] [Generic Construction of Optimal-Access Binary MDS Array Codes with Smaller Sub-packetization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09251)
*Lan Ma,Qifu Tyler Sun,Shaoteng Liu,Liyang Zhou*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper presents two generic constructions for binary MDS array codes with optimal repair bandwidth for single-node failures, achieving smaller sub-packetization than existing codes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The repair problem of binary MDS array codes has drawn much attention, particularly for single-node failures, and existing codes often have large sub-packetization.

Method: Two generic approaches: Generic Construction I produces codes with optimal access bandwidth using arbitrary base codes, and Generic Construction II produces codes with optimal repair bandwidth for even r≥4.

Result: Construction I yields (k+r,k,ms^⌈(k+r)/s⌉) codes with optimal access bandwidth, while Construction II yields (k+r,k,ms^{(k+r)/(s+1)}) codes with optimal repair bandwidth and smaller sub-packetization.

Conclusion: The proposed constructions provide binary MDS array codes with optimal repair properties and significantly reduced sub-packetization compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: A $(k+r,k,l)$ binary array code of length $k+r$, dimension $k$, and sub-packetization $l$ is composed of $l\times(k+r)$ matrices over $\mathbb{F}_2$, with every column of the matrix stored on a separate node in the distributed storage system and viewed as a coordinate of the codeword. It is said to be maximum distance separable (MDS) if any $k$ out of $k+r$ coordinates suffice to reconstruct the whole codeword. The repair problem of binary MDS array codes has drawn much attention, particularly for single-node failures. In this paper, given an arbitrary binary MDS array code with sub-packetization $m$ as the base code, we propose two generic approaches (Generic Construction I and II) for constructing binary MDS array codes with optimal access (or repair) bandwidth for single-node failures. For every $s\leq r$, a $(k+r,k,ms^{\lceil \frac{k+r}{s}\rceil})$ code $\mathcal{C}_1$ with optimal access bandwidth can be constructed by Generic Construction I. Repairing a failed node of $\mathcal{C}_1$ requires connecting to $d = k+s-1$ helper nodes, in which $s-1$ helper nodes are designated and $k$ are free to select. $\mathcal{C}_1$ generally achieves smaller sub-packetization and provides greater flexibility in the selection of its coefficient matrices. For even $r\geq4$ and $s=\frac{r}{2}$ such that $s+1$ divides $k+r$, a $(k+r, k,ms^{\frac{k+r}{s+1}})$ code $\mathcal{C}_2$ with optimal repair bandwidth can be constructed by Generic Construction II, with $\frac{s}{s+1}(k+r)$ out of $k+r$ nodes having the optimal access property. To the best of our knowledge, $\mathcal{C}_2$ possesses the smallest sub-packetization among existing binary MDS array codes with optimal repair bandwidth known to date.

### [224] [Enabling Smart Radio Environments in the Frequency Domain With Movable Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09384)
*Matteo Nerini,Bruno Clerckx*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper proposes movable signals in the frequency domain as a new approach to enable smart radio environments, overcoming implementation challenges of existing RIS technologies by dynamically shifting signal spectrum instead of using electronically reconfigurable components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current smart radio environment technologies like reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and flexible antennas rely on electronically reconfigurable/movable components, which introduce implementation challenges that could hinder commercialization.

Method: Proposes movable signals in the frequency domain where signal spectrum can be dynamically moved along the frequency axis. Analyzes movable signals in MISO systems under both LoS and NLoS conditions, leveraging fixed intelligent surfaces (FISs) with uniformly spaced elements having fixed EM properties.

Result: Movable signals achieve higher average received power than quantized equal gain transmission in LoS conditions. Under NLoS conditions, FIS-aided systems using movable signals can achieve up to 4x the received power of RIS-aided systems using fixed-frequency signals.

Conclusion: Movable signals in the frequency domain provide a promising alternative to existing SRE technologies, offering superior performance while avoiding the implementation challenges of electronically reconfigurable components.

Abstract: Smart radio environments (SREs) enhance wireless communications by allowing control over the channel. They have been enabled through surfaces with reconfigurable electromagnetic (EM) properties, known as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), and through flexible antennas, which can be viewed as realizations of SREs in the EM domain and space domain, respectively. However, these technologies rely on electronically reconfigurable or movable components, introducing implementation challenges that could hinder commercialization. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new domain to enable SREs, the frequency domain, through the concept of movable signals, where the signal spectrum can be dynamically moved along the frequency axis. We first analyze movable signals in multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems under line-of-sight (LoS) conditions, showing that they can achieve higher average received power than quantized equal gain transmission (EGT). We then study movable signals under non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions, showing that they remain effective by leveraging reflections from surfaces made of uniformly spaced elements with fixed EM properties, denoted as fixed intelligent surfaces (FISs). Analytical results reveal that a FIS-aided system using movable signals can achieve up to four times the received power of a RIS-aided system using fixed-frequency signals.

### [225] [Computability of the Optimizer for Rate Distortion Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09412)
*Jonathan E. W. Huffmann,Holger Boche*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper investigates the computability of the optimizer for rate distortion functions, finding that while the rate distortion function itself is computable, the optimizing test channel is generally non-computable even for simple distortion measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the theoretical limits of computing the optimal test channel in rate distortion theory, which is important for practical codebook construction in communication and information theory.

Method: The study analyzes the computability properties of the rate distortion function and its optimizer through theoretical examination, comparing with known results about optimizers for other information theoretic problems.

Result: The rate distortion function is computable, but the optimizing test channel (the optimizer) is generally non-computable, even for simple distortion measures.

Conclusion: There exists a fundamental computational limitation in determining the optimal test channel for rate distortion problems, despite the computability of the rate distortion function itself.

Abstract: Rate distortion theory treats the problem of encoding a source with minimum codebook size while at the same time allowing for a certain amount of errors in the reconstruction measured by a fidelity criterion and distortion level. Similar to the channel coding problem the optimal rate of the codebook with respect to the blocklength is given by a convex optimization problem involving information theoretic quantities like mutual information. The value of the rate in dependence of the distortion level as well as the optimizer used in the codebook construction are of theoretical and practical importance in communication and information theory. In this paper the behavior of the rate distortion function regarding the computability of the optimizing test channel is investigated. We find that comparable with known results about the optimizer for other information theoretic problems a similar result is found to be true also regarding the computability of the optimizer for rate distortion functions.
  It turns out that while the rate distortion function is usually computable the optimizer for this problem is in general non-computable even for simple distortion measures.
