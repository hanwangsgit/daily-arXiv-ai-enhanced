Motivation: To overcome sensor limitations in autonomous vehicles by combining local environment models from multiple vehicles, where existing methods suffer from high computational complexity or rely on heuristics.

Method: Proposed association algorithm based on stochastic optimization that uses multidimensional likelihood incorporating track count and spatial distribution, and computes several association hypotheses.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness through Monte Carlo simulations and realistic collective perception scenarios, showing capability to compute high-likelihood associations in ambiguous settings.

Conclusion: The stochastic optimization approach provides an effective solution for track-to-track association in collective perception, handling ambiguous scenarios while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Collective perception is a key aspect for autonomous driving in smart cities
as it aims to combine the local environment models of multiple intelligent
vehicles in order to overcome sensor limitations. A crucial part of
multi-sensor fusion is track-to-track association. Previous works often suffer
from high computational complexity or are based on heuristics. We propose an
association algorithms based on stochastic optimization, which leverages a
multidimensional likelihood incorporating the number of tracks and their
spatial distribution and furthermore computes several association hypotheses.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in Monte Carlo simulations and
a realistic collective perception scenario computing high-likelihood
associations in ambiguous settings.
