Although classical data association approaches such as JPDA are well suited for dynamic targets, they are less effective for static objects observed intermittently and with heterogeneous uncertainties, where motion models provide minimal discriminative with respect to clutter.

For such robots, interaction understanding is not primarily a fine-grained recognition problem, but a perception problem under limited sensing quality and computational resources. Many existing approaches focus on holistic group activity recognition, which often requires complex and large models which may not be necessary for mobile service robots. Others use pairwise interaction methods which commonly rely on skeletal representations but their use in outdoor environments remains challenging. In this work, we argue that pairwise human interaction constitute a minimal yet sufficient perceptual unit for robot-centric social understanding. We study the problem of identifying interacting person pairs and classifying coarse-grained interaction behaviors sufficient for downstream group-level reasoning and service robot decision-making. To this end, we adopt a two-stage framework in which candidate interacting pairs are first identified based on lightweight geometric and motion cues, and interaction types are subsequently classified using a relation network.

This work introduces a hierarchical trajectory planning framework that integrates global guidance with configuration-aware local optimization.

A family of imaging methods called Full Waveform Inversion (FWI), which has been developed in the field of seismic imaging, uses full acoustic wave simulations as direct models, taking into account virtually all nonlinearities, which can ultimately enhance the accuracy of ultrasonic imaging. However, the problem of cycle skipping -- the existence of many local minima of the Least Squares (L2) misfit function due to the oscillatory nature of the signals -- is worsened when FWI is applied to ultrasound data because of a lack of low-frequency components. In this paper, we explore the use of the squared Wasserstein (W2) Optimal Transport Distance as the metric for the misfit between the acquired and the synthetic data, applying the method to Nondestructive Evaluation with ultrasonic phased arrays. An analytical continuous time-domain derivation of the adjoint acoustic field related to the W2 misfit is presented and used for the computation of the gradients. To cope with the computational burden of FWI, we apply a low-memory strategy that allows for the computation of the gradients without the storage of the full simulated fields. The GPU implementation of the method (in CUDA language) is detailed, and the source code is made available. Six prototypical cases are presented, and the corresponding sound speed maps are reconstructed with FWI using both the L2 and the W2 misfit functionals. In five of the six cases, the pixel-wise sum of squared errors obtained with W2 was at least one order of magnitude lower than that obtained with W2, with an increase in the gradient computation time not exceeding 2\\%.

Next, a higher-order accurate deep learning method for computing geodesic distances on surfaces is introduced. Traditionally, one considers two main components when computing distances on surfaces: a numerical solver that locally approximates the distance function, and an efficient causal ordering scheme by which surface points are updated. Classical minimal path methods often exploit a dynamic programming principle with quasi-linear computational complexity in the number of sampled points. The quality of the distance approximation is determined by the local solver that is revisited in this paper. To improve state of the art accuracy, we consider a neural network-based local solver which implicitly approximates the structure of the continuous surface.

The micro-signals that serve as RF fingerprints are termed ``micro-CSI''. Through experimentation, we have found that the presence of micro-CSI can primarily be attributed to imperfections in the RF circuitry. Furthermore, this characteristic signal is detectable in WiFi 4/5/6 network interface cards (NICs). We have conducted further experiments to determine the most effective CSI collection configurations to stabilize micro-CSI. Yet, extracting micro-CSI for authentication purposes poses a significant challenge. This complexity arises from the fact that CSI measurements inherently include both micro-CSI and the distortions introduced by wireless channels. These two elements are intricately intertwined, making their separation non-trivial. To tackle this challenge, we have developed a signal space-based extraction technique for line-of-sight (LoS) scenarios, which can effectively separate the distortions caused by wireless channels and micro-CSI. Over the course of our comprehensive CSI data collection period extending beyond one year, we found that the extracted micro-CSI displays unique characteristics specific to each WiFi device and remains invariant over time. This establishes micro-CSI as a suitable candidate for device fingerprinting. Finally, we conduct a case study focusing on area access control for mobile robots.

In this paper, we explore whether Metamorphic Testing (MT) can alleviate the test oracle problem in this context. To do so, we propose two metamorphic relation patterns and five metamorphic relations to assess whether changes to the test inputs impact the original trajectory of the VLA-enabled robots. An empirical study involving five VLA models, two simulated robots, and four robotic tasks shows that MT can effectively alleviate the test oracle problem by automatically detecting diverse types of failures, including, but not limited to, uncompleted tasks. More importantly, the proposed MRs are generalizable, making the proposed approach applicable across different VLA models, robots, and tasks, even in the absence of test oracles.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes using metamorphic testing to address the test oracle problem in Vision-Language-Action models for robotics, introducing patterns and relations to detect failures in task execution.", "motivation": "VLA models for robotics face the test oracle problem: defining oracles for each instruction is complex and non-generalizable, and current oracles focus on task correctness but miss quality assessment.

However, for beamform design, accurate channel state information (CSI) is needed, which is often difficult to obtain due to channel variability, feedback overhead, or hardware constraints.

To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel prediction-assisted optimization (PAO) framework for beamform design in AF relay-assisted multiuser MIMO systems. The proposed solution in the AF relay aims at maximizing the signal-plus-interference-to-noise ratio (SINR). Unlike other methods, PAO relies solely on received power measurements, making it suitable for scenarios where CSI is unreliable or unavailable. PAO consists of two stages: a supervised-learning-based neural network (NN) that predicts the positions of transmitters using signal observations, and an optimization algorithm, guided by a digital twin (DT), that iteratively refines the beam direction of the relay in a simulated radio environment. As a key contribution, we validate the proposed framework using realistic measurements collected on a custom-built experimental millimeter wave (mmWave) platform, which enables training of the NN model under practical wireless conditions.

This lack of historical tracking inevitably leads to non-vanishing steady-state bias, where the reconstruction fails to strictly satisfy physical measurements under heavy corruption. To resolve this, we propose Dual-Coupled PnP Diffusion, which restores the classical dual variable to provide integral feedback, theoretically guaranteeing asymptotic convergence to the exact data manifold.

The dynamics are strictly unitary, ensuring that the state norm is preserved exactly at every time step via a Cayley (Crank--Nicolson) discretization. Token probabilities are extracted using the Born rule, a quadratic measurement operator that couples magnitudes and relative phases. Our primary theoretical contribution is a separation theorem characterizing the representational advantage of this readout: we define a family of disambiguation tasks that a complex unitary model of dimension $N$ solves exactly, but which requires a state dimension of $\u03a9(N^2)$ for any real-valued orthogonal model equipped with a standard affine-softmax readout. This quadratic gap arises because the Born rule implicitly lifts the $N$-dimensional state into the space of rank-one Hermitian matrices, accessing pairwise phase correlations that are inaccessible to linear projections.

In this work, we diagnose this issue by introducing the Visualized-Question (VQ) setting, where text queries are rendered directly onto images to structurally mandate visual engagement. Our diagnostic experiments on Qwen2.5-VL reveal a startling capability-utilization gap: despite possessing strong OCR capabilities, models suffer a performance degradation of up to 12.7% in the VQ setting, exposing a deep-seated ``modality laziness.'' To bridge this gap, we propose SimpleOCR, a plug-and-play training strategy that imposes a structural constraint on the learning process. By transforming training samples into the VQ format with randomized styles, SimpleOCR effectively invalidates text-based shortcuts, compelling the model to activate and optimize its visual text extraction pathways. Empirically, SimpleOCR yields robust gains without architectural modifications.

Our central insight is that steganography creates an asymmetry in usable information between agents who can and cannot decode the hidden content (present within a steganographic signal), and this otherwise latent asymmetry can be inferred from the agents' observable actions. To formalise this perspective, we introduce generalised $\\mathcal{V}$-information: a utilitarian framework for measuring the amount of usable information within some input. We use this to define the \\textbf{steganographic gap} -- a measure that quantifies steganography by comparing the downstream utility of the steganographic signal to agents that can and cannot decode the hidden content. We empirically validate our formalism, and show that it can be used to detect, quantify, and mitigate steganographic reasoning in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes a decision-theoretic framework to detect and quantify steganographic reasoning in LLMs, introducing the \"steganographic gap\" measure based on utility differences between agents who can and cannot decode hidden content.", "motivation": "Large language models are developing steganographic capabilities that could allow misaligned models to evade oversight mechanisms, but existing detection methods require known reference distributions which are infeasible for LLM steganography.", "method": "Proposes a decision-theoretic view of steganography using generalized V-information framework to measure usable information, defining the \"steganographic gap\" that compares downstream utility of steganographic signals to agents with and without decoding capability.", "result": "Empirically validates the formalism and shows it can be used to detect, quantify, and mitigate steganographic reasoning in LLMs.", "conclusion": "The decision-theoretic approach provides a principled method to address steganographic capabilities in LLMs where classical methods fail, offering practical tools for detection and mitigation."}}

The framework is evaluated on mixture data by mixing clay, silt, and sand in varying proportions, using the USDA classification triangle as a basis.

Leveraging this insight, we propose DySL-VLA, a novel framework that addresses computational cost by dynamically skipping VLA layers based on each action's importance. DySL-VLA categorizes its layers into two types: informative layers, which are consistently executed, and incremental layers, which can be selectively skipped.

Motivated by this observation, we propose Metacognitive Behavioral Tuning (MBT), a post-training framework that explicitly injects metacognitive behaviors into the model's thought process.

Indeed, minimizing the risk from the AV's perspective may not imply that the risk from the perspective of other road users is also being minimized; in fact, it may even increase. To test this hypothesis, we propose an AV motion planning strategy that supports switching risk minimization strategies between all road user perspectives. We find that the risk from the perspective of other road users can generally be considered different to the risk from the AV's perspective. Taking a collective risk perspective, i.e., balancing the risks of all road users, we observe an AV that minimizes overall traffic risk the best, while putting itself at slightly higher risk for the benefit of others, which is consistent with human driving behavior. In addition, adopting a collective risk minimization strategy can also be beneficial to the AV's travel efficiency by acting assertively when other road users maintain a low risk estimate of the AV. Yet, the AV drives conservatively when its planned actions are less predictable to other road users, i.e., associated with high risk. We argue that such behavior is a form of self-reflection and a natural prerequisite for socially acceptable AV behavior. We conclude that to facilitate ethicality in road traffic that includes AVs, the risk-perspective of each road user must be considered in the decision-making of AVs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Current AV motion planning minimizes risk only from the AV's perspective, ignoring ethical implications for other road users.

Post-hoc probability calibration was applied to enable interpretable, trial-level risk stratification. Results: The late-fusion model achieved the highest AUC-ROC (0.862). Beyond discrimination, calibrated outputs enabled robust stratification of CTs into predefined risk categories. The proportion of trials labeled as having an excessively high dosing error rate increased monotonically across higher predicted risk groups and aligned with the corresponding predicted probability ranges. Discussion: These findings indicate that dosing error risk can be anticipated at the trial level using pre-initiation information. Probability calibration was essential for translating model outputs into reliable and interpretable risk categories, while simple multimodal integration yielded performance gains without requiring complex architectures.

In practice, these models are predominantly trained via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), yet most existing outcome-only RLVR pipelines rely almost exclusively on a binary correctness signal and largely ignore the model's intrinsic uncertainty. We term this discrepancy the uncertainty-reward mismatch, under which high- and low-uncertainty solutions are treated equivalently, preventing the policy from \"Know What You Know\" and impeding the shift from optimizing for correct answers to optimizing effective reasoning paths.

To address this, we propose EGPO, a metacognitive entropy calibration framework that explicitly integrates intrinsic uncertainty into RLVR for enhancing LRMs. EGPO estimates per-sample uncertainty using a zero-overhead entropy proxy derived from token-level likelihoods and aligns it with extrinsic correctness through an asymmetric calibration mechanism that preserves correct reasoning while selectively regulating overconfident failures, thereby enabling stable and uncertainty-aware policy optimization.

Currently, IL-based methods have become a mainstream paradigm: models rely on standard driving behaviors given by experts, and learn to minimize the discrepancy between their actions and expert actions. However, this objective of \"only driving like the expert\" suffers from limited generalization: when encountering rare or unseen long-tail scenarios outside the distribution of expert demonstrations, models tend to produce unsafe decisions in the absence of prior experience. This raises a fundamental question: Can an E2E-AD system make reliable decisions without any expert action supervision? Motivated by this, we propose a unified framework named Risk-aware World Model Predictive Control (RaWMPC) to address this generalization dilemma through robust control, without reliance on expert demonstrations. Practically, RaWMPC leverages a world model to predict the consequences of multiple candidate actions and selects low-risk actions through explicit risk evaluation. To endow the world model with the ability to predict the outcomes of risky driving behaviors, we design a risk-aware interaction strategy that systematically exposes the world model to hazardous behaviors, making catastrophic outcomes predictable and thus avoidable.

Deep learning models appear promising for predicting molecular structure spectra, but overall assessment remains challenging as a result of the heterogeneity in methods and the lack of well-defined benchmarks. To address this, our contribution is the creation of benchmark framework FlexMS for constructing and evaluating diverse model architectures in mass spectrum prediction. With its easy-to-use flexibility, FlexMS supports the dynamic construction of numerous distinct combinations of model architectures, while assessing their performance on preprocessed public datasets using different metrics.

While existing methods generate part-level 3D objects, they often fail to organize these parts into distinct instances in open-world scenes. Through a debiased clustering probe, we reveal a critical insight: this failure stems from the lack of structural constraints within the model's internal assignment mechanism. Based on this finding, we reframe the task of structured 3D scene generation as a global correlation assignment problem. To solve this, SceneTransporter formulates and solves an entropic Optimal Transport (OT) objective within the denoising loop of the compositional DiT model. This formulation imposes two powerful structural constraints. First, the resulting transport plan gates cross-attention to enforce an exclusive, one-to-one routing of image patches to part-level 3D latents, preventing entanglement.

We present S2O, which performs early stopping for sparse attention via online permutation. Inspired by virtual-to-physical address mapping in memory systems, S2O revisits and factorizes FlashAttention execution, enabling inference to load non-contiguous tokens rather than a contiguous span in the original order. Motivated by fine-grained structures in attention heatmaps, we transform explicit permutation into an online, index-guided, discrete loading policy; with extremely lightweight preprocessing and index-remapping overhead, it concentrates importance on a small set of high-priority blocks. Building on this importance-guided online permutation for loading, S2O further introduces an early-stopping rule: computation proceeds from high to low importance; once the current block score falls below a threshold, S2O terminates early and skips the remaining low-contribution blocks, thereby increasing effective sparsity and reducing computation under a controlled error budget.\n  As a result, S2O substantially raises the practical sparsity ceiling.

To address this, we introduce SO3UFormer, a rotation-robust architecture designed to learn intrinsic spherical features that are less sensitive to the underlying coordinate frame. Our approach rests on three geometric pillars: (1) an intrinsic feature formulation that decouples the representation from the gravity vector by removing absolute latitude encoding; (2) quadrature-consistent spherical attention that accounts for non-uniform sampling densities; and (3) a gauge-aware relative positional mechanism that encodes local angular geometry using tangent-plane projected angles and discrete gauge pooling, avoiding reliance on global axes.

To rigorously benchmark robustness, we introduce Pose35, a dataset variant of Stanford2D3D perturbed by random rotations within $\\pm 35^\\circ$. Under the extreme test of arbitrary full SO(3) rotations, existing SOTAs fail catastrophically: the baseline SphereUFormer drops from 67.53 mIoU to 25.26 mIoU.

Prior fingerspelling recognition methods rely on explicit signing-hand detection, which often leads to recognition failures, and on a connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss, which exhibits the peaky behavior problem. To address these issues, we develop OpenFS, an open-source approach for fingerspelling recognition and synthesis.

However, most existing methods face challenges in learning effective knowledge from generic graphs, primarily due to simplistic data alignment and limited training guidance. The issue of simplistic data alignment arises from the use of a straightforward unification for highly diverse graph data, which fails to align semantics and misleads pre-training models. The problem with limited training guidance lies in the arbitrary application of in-domain pre-training paradigms to cross-domain scenarios. While it is effective in enhancing discriminative representation in one data space, it struggles to capture effective knowledge from many graphs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Latent sEmantic Distribution Alignment (LEDA) model for universal graph pre-training. Specifically, we first introduce a dimension projection unit to adaptively align diverse domain features into a shared semantic space with minimal information loss. Furthermore, we design a variational semantic inference module to obtain the shared latent distribution. The distribution is then adopted to guide the domain projection, aligning it with shared semantics across domains and ensuring cross-domain semantic learning.

Building upon the original DJSCC formulation, low-complexity attention-style architectures has been added to the DNNs for further performance enhancement.

One such setting is microscopic analysis of cell-body-stained histological human brain sections, which enables the study of cytoarchitecture: cell density and morphology and their laminar and areal organization. Here, we propose a label-mediated method that generates meaningful captions from images by linking images and text only through a label, without requiring curated paired image-text data. Given the label, we automatically mine area descriptions from related literature and use them as synthetic captions reflecting canonical cytoarchitectonic attributes. An existing cytoarchitectonic vision foundation model (CytoNet) is then coupled to a large language model via an image-to-text training objective, enabling microscopy regions to be described in natural language. Across 57 brain areas, the resulting method produces plausible area-level descriptions and supports open-set use through explicit rejection of unseen areas.

However, we find a key issue in estimating stepwise relative advantages, namely context inconsistency, where steps within the same group may differ in their historical contexts. Empirically, we reveal that this issue can lead to severely biased advantage estimation, thereby degrading policy optimization significantly. To address the issue, in this paper, we propose Hierarchy-of-Groups Policy Optimization (HGPO) for long-horizon agentic tasks. Specifically, within a group of rollout trajectories, HGPO assigns each step to multiple hierarchical groups according to the consistency of historical contexts.

To overcome the challenge, we propose a novel approach that accumulates comprehensive knowledge in both textual and visual modalities from unsupervised data to update multimodal prototypes at test time. Building on this, we further design an adaptive update weight to control the degree of prototype adjustment, enabling the model to flexibly adapt to distribution shift during testing.

To tackle the challenge, this work is motivated by the intuition that multisource degraded feature distributions are induced by different degradation-specific shifts from an underlying degradation-agnostic distribution, and recovering such a shared distribution is thus crucial for achieving generalization across degradations. With this insight, we propose BaryIR, a representation learning framework that aligns multisource degraded features in the Wasserstein barycenter (WB) space, which models a degradation-agnostic distribution by minimizing the average of Wasserstein distances to multisource degraded distributions. We further introduce residual subspaces, whose embeddings are mutually contrasted while remaining orthogonal to the WB embeddings. Consequently, BaryIR explicitly decouples two orthogonal spaces: a WB space that encodes the degradation-agnostic invariant contents shared across degradations, and residual subspaces that adaptively preserve the degradation-specific knowledge. This disentanglement mitigates overfitting to in-distribution degradations and enables adaptive restoration grounded on the degradation-agnostic shared invariance.

We first invoke a specialized face recognition model as an external \"tool\" to establish Factual Groundings--precise character identities and their corresponding bounding boxes. These groundings are then injected into the prompt to steer the VLM's reasoning, ensuring the generated scene descriptions are anchored to verifiable facts. Furthermore, our progressive abstraction pipeline decomposes the summarization of a full-length movie into a multi-stage process, effectively mitigating the context length limitations of current VLMs. Experiments demonstrate that our approach yields significant improvements in factual accuracy, character consistency, and overall narrative coherence compared to end-to-end baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "MovieTeller: A training-free framework for generating movie synopses using tool-augmented progressive abstraction to improve character consistency and narrative coherence in long-form video summarization.", "motivation": "Existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) fail at long-form video summarization due to inconsistent character identification and fractured narrative coherence, creating a need for better automated synopsis generation for movies and TV series.", "method": "Training-free, tool-augmented framework that uses face recognition models to establish factual groundings (character IDs and bounding boxes), injects these into prompts to steer VLM reasoning, and employs progressive abstraction pipeline to decompose full-length movie summarization into multi-stage process.", "result": "Significant improvements in factual accuracy, character consistency, and overall narrative coherence compared to end-to-end baselines, without requiring costly model fine-tuning.", "conclusion": "MovieTeller effectively addresses limitations of current VLMs in long-duration contexts by leveraging external tools for factual grounding and progressive abstraction, enabling high-quality movie synopsis generation using off-the-shelf models."}}

However, existing research on spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG), given a textual query, mainly focuses on localizing targets in short videos of tens of seconds, typically less than one minute, which limits real-world applications. In this paper, we explore Long-Form STVG (LF-STVG), which aims to locate targets in long-term videos. Compared with short videos, long-term videos contain much longer temporal spans and more irrelevant information, making it difficult for existing STVG methods that process all frames at once. To address this challenge, we propose an AutoRegressive Transformer architecture for LF-STVG, termed ART-STVG. Unlike conventional STVG methods that require the entire video sequence to make predictions at once, ART-STVG treats the video as streaming input and processes frames sequentially, enabling efficient handling of long videos. To model spatio-temporal context, we design spatial and temporal memory banks and apply them to the decoders. Since memories from different moments are not always relevant to the current frame, we introduce simple yet effective memory selection strategies to provide more relevant information to the decoders, significantly improving performance. Furthermore, instead of parallel spatial and temporal localization, we propose a cascaded spatio-temporal design that connects the spatial decoder to the temporal decoder, allowing fine-grained spatial cues to assist complex temporal localization in long videos.
