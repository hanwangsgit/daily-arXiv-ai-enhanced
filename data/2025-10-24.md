*Sai Teja Erukude,Viswa Chaitanya Marella,Suhasnadh Reddy Veluru*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using frequency-domain analysis with 2D DFT and ResNet50 to detect StyleGAN-generated images, achieving 92.8% accuracy and 0.95 AUC by identifying unique frequency signatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid rise of photorealistic GAN-generated images poses serious challenges for image forensics and industrial systems requiring reliable content authenticity.

Method: Applied 2D DFT to transform images into Fourier domain to detect subtle periodic artifacts, then trained ResNet50 neural network on these transformed images to differentiate real vs synthetic images.

Result: Frequency-domain model achieved 92.8% accuracy and 0.95 AUC, significantly outperforming equivalent model trained on raw spatial-domain images.

Conclusion: GAN-generated images have unique frequency-domain signatures, and combining signal processing with deep learning has industrial potential for enhancing digital forensics and AI system trustworthiness.

Abstract: The rapid rise of photorealistic images produced from Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) poses a serious challenge for image forensics and industrial
systems requiring reliable content authenticity. This paper uses
frequency-domain analysis combined with deep learning to solve the problem of
distinguishing StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Specifically, a
two-dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform (2D DFT) was applied to transform
images into the Fourier domain, where subtle periodic artifacts become
detectable. A ResNet50 neural network is trained on these transformed images to
differentiate between real and synthetic ones. The experiments demonstrate that
the frequency-domain model achieves a 92.8 percent and an AUC of 0.95,
significantly outperforming the equivalent model trained on raw spatial-domain
images. These results indicate that the GAN-generated images have unique
frequency-domain signatures or "fingerprints". The method proposed highlights
the industrial potential of combining signal processing techniques and deep
learning to enhance digital forensics and strengthen the trustworthiness of
industrial AI systems.

### [2] [Transformed Multi-view 3D Shape Features with Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19955)
*Márcus Vinícius Lobo Costa,Sherlon Almeida da Silva,Bárbara Caroline Benato,Leo Sampaio Ferraz Ribeiro,Moacir Antonelli Ponti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Transformers (ViTs) with contrastive learning achieve ~90.6% accuracy on ModelNet10 for 3D shape analysis, overcoming CNN limitations and reducing need for extensive labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in 3D shape representation learning where CNNs struggle with shape relationships and require extensive labeled data for 2D-to-3D object recognition.

Method: Combine Vision Transformers (ViTs) with contrastive learning objectives (both supervised and self-supervised) for multi-view 3D analysis, leveraging ViTs' global shape understanding and contrastive learning's feature refinement.

Result: Achieved 90.6% accuracy on ModelNet10, demonstrating promising performance in multi-view 3D analysis tasks by capturing global shape semantics and refining local features.

Conclusion: ViTs paired with contrastive learning effectively unify 3D shape understanding pipelines, overcoming CNN limitations and reducing dependency on extensive labeled data through empirical validation.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges in representation learning of 3D shape
features by investigating state-of-the-art backbones paired with both
contrastive supervised and self-supervised learning objectives. Computer vision
methods struggle with recognizing 3D objects from 2D images, often requiring
extensive labeled data and relying on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that
may overlook crucial shape relationships. Our work demonstrates that Vision
Transformers (ViTs) based architectures, when paired with modern contrastive
objectives, achieve promising results in multi-view 3D analysis on our
downstream tasks, unifying contrastive and 3D shape understanding pipelines.
For example, supervised contrastive losses reached about 90.6% accuracy on
ModelNet10. The use of ViTs and contrastive learning, leveraging ViTs' ability
to understand overall shapes and contrastive learning's effectiveness,
overcomes the need for extensive labeled data and the limitations of CNNs in
capturing crucial shape relationships. The success stems from capturing global
shape semantics via ViTs and refining local discriminative features through
contrastive optimization. Importantly, our approach is empirical, as it is
grounded on extensive experimental evaluation to validate the effectiveness of
combining ViTs with contrastive objectives for 3D representation learning.

### [3] [FutrTrack: A Camera-LiDAR Fusion Transformer for 3D Multiple Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19981)
*Martha Teiko Teye,Ori Maoz,Matthias Rottmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FutrTrack is a modular camera-LiDAR multi-object tracking framework that uses transformer-based refinement and multimodal fusion to improve 3D tracking performance without explicit motion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance 3D multi-object tracking by leveraging multimodal sensor fusion (camera and LiDAR) in transformer-based frameworks, addressing limitations of single-sensor approaches and improving robustness under occlusion and viewpoint changes.

Method: Uses a transformer-based smoother for temporal refinement and a fusion-driven tracker that integrates bounding boxes with multimodal BEV features from cameras and LiDAR. Employs two-stage transformer refinement and tracking without explicit motion models.

Result: Achieves 74.7 aMOTA on nuScenes test set, reduces identity switches while maintaining competitive accuracy. Outperforms previous single-sensor approaches on nuScenes and KITTI benchmarks.

Conclusion: Multimodal sensor features significantly benefit query-based transformer tracking methods. The framework provides efficient improvement for transformer-based trackers to compete with neural-network-based methods even with limited data and no pretraining.

Abstract: We propose FutrTrack, a modular camera-LiDAR multi-object tracking framework
that builds on existing 3D detectors by introducing a transformer-based
smoother and a fusion-driven tracker. Inspired by query-based tracking
frameworks, FutrTrack employs a multimodal two-stage transformer refinement and
tracking pipeline. Our fusion tracker integrates bounding boxes with multimodal
bird's-eye-view (BEV) fusion features from multiple cameras and LiDAR without
the need for an explicit motion model. The tracker assigns and propagates
identities across frames, leveraging both geometric and semantic cues for
robust re-identification under occlusion and viewpoint changes. Prior to
tracking, we refine sequences of bounding boxes with a temporal smoother over a
moving window to refine trajectories, reduce jitter, and improve spatial
consistency. Evaluated on nuScenes and KITTI, FutrTrack demonstrates that
query-based transformer tracking methods benefit significantly from multimodal
sensor features compared with previous single-sensor approaches. With an aMOTA
of 74.7 on the nuScenes test set, FutrTrack achieves strong performance on 3D
MOT benchmarks, reducing identity switches while maintaining competitive
accuracy. Our approach provides an efficient framework for improving
transformer-based trackers to compete with other neural-network-based methods
even with limited data and without pretraining.

### [4] [Improving Predictive Confidence in Medical Imaging via Online Label Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20011)
*Kushan Choudhury,Shubhrodeep Roy,Ankur Chanda,Shubhajit Biswas,Somenath Kuiry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Online Label Smoothing (OLS) improves medical image classification by dynamically adjusting soft labels during training, outperforming traditional methods in accuracy and feature representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models in medical imaging often produce overconfident predictions, reducing reliability in healthcare. Traditional label smoothing fails to consider class relationships by treating all non-target classes equally.

Method: Evaluated Online Label Smoothing (OLS) on RadImageNet dataset using ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG-19 architectures. OLS dynamically adjusts soft labels during training based on the model's prediction patterns.

Result: OLS consistently improved Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy compared to hard labels, conventional label smoothing, and teacher-free knowledge distillation. Also led to more compact and well-separated feature embeddings.

Conclusion: OLS strengthens predictive performance and enhances calibration, making it a practical solution for developing trustworthy AI systems in medical imaging.

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks, have achieved
impressive results in medical image classification. However, these models often
produce overconfident predictions, which can undermine their reliability in
critical healthcare settings. While traditional label smoothing offers a simple
way to reduce such overconfidence, it fails to consider relationships between
classes by treating all non-target classes equally. In this study, we explore
the use of Online Label Smoothing (OLS), a dynamic approach that adjusts soft
labels throughout training based on the model's own prediction patterns. We
evaluate OLS on the large-scale RadImageNet dataset using three widely used
architectures: ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG-19. Our results show that OLS
consistently improves both Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy compared to
standard training methods, including hard labels, conventional label smoothing,
and teacher-free knowledge distillation. In addition to accuracy gains, OLS
leads to more compact and well-separated feature embeddings, indicating
improved representation learning. These findings suggest that OLS not only
strengthens predictive performance but also enhances calibration, making it a
practical and effective solution for developing trustworthy AI systems in the
medical imaging domain.

### [5] [A Unified Detection Pipeline for Robust Object Detection in Fisheye-Based Traffic Surveillance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20016)
*Neema Jakisa Owor,Joshua Kofi Asamoah,Tanner Wambui Muturi,Anneliese Jakisa Owor,Blessing Agyei Kyem,Andrews Danyo,Yaw Adu-Gyamfi,Armstrong Aboah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A detection framework for fisheye cameras that addresses radial distortion challenges through preprocessing, postprocessing, and ensemble methods, achieving competitive results on traffic surveillance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fisheye cameras are efficient for wide-area traffic surveillance but suffer from strong radial distortion and nonuniform resolution, especially near image boundaries, which degrades standard object detection performance.

Method: Uses preprocessing and postprocessing pipeline to enhance detection consistency across distorted regions, trains multiple state-of-the-art detection models on fisheye traffic imagery, and combines outputs through ensemble strategy.

Result: Achieved F1 score of 0.6366 on 2025 AI City Challenge Track 4, ranking 8th out of 62 teams.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses fisheye imagery challenges and demonstrates robust detection performance in distorted regions.

Abstract: Fisheye cameras offer an efficient solution for wide-area traffic
surveillance by capturing large fields of view from a single vantage point.
However, the strong radial distortion and nonuniform resolution inherent in
fisheye imagery introduce substantial challenges for standard object detectors,
particularly near image boundaries where object appearance is severely
degraded. In this work, we present a detection framework designed to operate
robustly under these conditions. Our approach employs a simple yet effective
pre and post processing pipeline that enhances detection consistency across the
image, especially in regions affected by severe distortion. We train several
state-of-the-art detection models on the fisheye traffic imagery and combine
their outputs through an ensemble strategy to improve overall detection
accuracy. Our method achieves an F1 score of0.6366 on the 2025 AI City
Challenge Track 4, placing 8thoverall out of 62 teams. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in addressing issues inherent to
fisheye imagery.

### [6] [Extreme Views: 3DGS Filter for Novel View Synthesis from Out-of-Distribution Camera Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20027)
*Damian Bowness,Charalambos Poullis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a real-time render-aware filtering method to reduce visual noise in 3D Gaussian Splatting when viewing from extrapolated camera positions outside training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting models exhibit substantial visual noise when viewed from camera positions outside the training distribution due to lack of training data in these regions.

Method: Uses sensitivity scores from intermediate gradients to filter instabilities caused by anisotropic orientations, targeting generative uncertainty rather than isotropic variance.

Result: Substantially improves visual quality, realism, and consistency compared to existing NeRF-based approaches like BayesRays, while maintaining real-time performance.

Conclusion: The proposed filter effectively addresses extrapolation artifacts in 3DGS, integrates seamlessly into existing rendering pipelines, and enables high visual fidelity during free navigation outside original training viewpoints.

Abstract: When viewing a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from camera positions
significantly outside the training data distribution, substantial visual noise
commonly occurs. These artifacts result from the lack of training data in these
extrapolated regions, leading to uncertain density, color, and geometry
predictions from the model.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel real-time render-aware filtering
method. Our approach leverages sensitivity scores derived from intermediate
gradients, explicitly targeting instabilities caused by anisotropic
orientations rather than isotropic variance. This filtering method directly
addresses the core issue of generative uncertainty, allowing 3D reconstruction
systems to maintain high visual fidelity even when users freely navigate
outside the original training viewpoints.
  Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method substantially improves
visual quality, realism, and consistency compared to existing Neural Radiance
Field (NeRF)-based approaches such as BayesRays. Critically, our filter
seamlessly integrates into existing 3DGS rendering pipelines in real-time,
unlike methods that require extensive post-hoc retraining or fine-tuning.

### [7] [BrainPuzzle: Hybrid Physics and Data-Driven Reconstruction for Transcranial Ultrasound Tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20029)
*Shengyu Chen,Shihang Feng,Yi Luo,Xiaowei Jia,Youzuo Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrainPuzzle is a hybrid two-stage framework combining physics-based modeling with machine learning for quantitative transcranial ultrasound brain imaging, addressing challenges of skull-induced signal degradation and sparse aperture limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ultrasound brain imaging faces challenges due to skull-induced attenuation, mode conversion, phase aberration, and incomplete spatial coverage from clinically impractical full-aperture arrays. Both physics-based FWI and purely data-driven methods have limitations in achieving accurate speed-of-sound mapping under low SNR and sparse-aperture conditions.

Method: Two-stage hybrid framework: 1) Reverse time migration (time-reversal acoustics) applied to multi-angle acquisitions to produce migration fragments preserving structural details under low SNR; 2) Transformer-based super-resolution encoder-decoder with graph-based attention unit (GAU) fuses fragments into coherent SoS image. Uses partial-array acquisition with movable low-count transducer set.

Result: Experiments on two synthetic datasets show superior SoS reconstruction accuracy and image completeness compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: BrainPuzzle demonstrates potential for advancing quantitative ultrasound brain imaging by effectively combining physical modeling with machine learning to overcome skull-induced challenges and sparse aperture limitations.

Abstract: Ultrasound brain imaging remains challenging due to the large difference in
sound speed between the skull and brain tissues and the difficulty of coupling
large probes to the skull. This work aims to achieve quantitative transcranial
ultrasound by reconstructing an accurate speed-of-sound (SoS) map of the brain.
Traditional physics-based full-waveform inversion (FWI) is limited by weak
signals caused by skull-induced attenuation, mode conversion, and phase
aberration, as well as incomplete spatial coverage since full-aperture arrays
are clinically impractical. In contrast, purely data-driven methods that learn
directly from raw ultrasound data often fail to model the complex nonlinear and
nonlocal wave propagation through bone, leading to anatomically plausible but
quantitatively biased SoS maps under low signal-to-noise and sparse-aperture
conditions. To address these issues, we propose BrainPuzzle, a hybrid two-stage
framework that combines physical modeling with machine learning. In the first
stage, reverse time migration (time-reversal acoustics) is applied to
multi-angle acquisitions to produce migration fragments that preserve
structural details even under low SNR. In the second stage, a transformer-based
super-resolution encoder-decoder with a graph-based attention unit (GAU) fuses
these fragments into a coherent and quantitatively accurate SoS image. A
partial-array acquisition strategy using a movable low-count transducer set
improves feasibility and coupling, while the hybrid algorithm compensates for
the missing aperture. Experiments on two synthetic datasets show that
BrainPuzzle achieves superior SoS reconstruction accuracy and image
completeness, demonstrating its potential for advancing quantitative ultrasound
brain imaging.

### [8] [Exposing Blindspots: Cultural Bias Evaluation in Generative Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20042)
*Huichan Seo,Sieun Choi,Minki Hong,Yi Zhou,Junseo Kim,Lukman Ismaila,Naome Etori,Mehul Agarwal,Zhixuan Liu,Jihie Kim,Jean Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a unified framework to evaluate cultural bias in both text-to-image (T2I) generation and image-to-image (I2I) editing systems across six countries, revealing that models default to Global-North depictions and I2I editing erodes cultural fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in cultural bias evaluation for image-to-image editing systems, which have been underexplored compared to text-to-image systems, and to provide standardized diagnostics for cultural representation in generative image models.

Method: Developed a unified evaluation framework across six countries using an 8-category/36-subcategory schema with era-aware prompts. Used open models with fixed settings and combined automatic metrics, culture-aware retrieval-augmented VQA, and expert human judgments from native reviewers.

Result: Three key findings: (1) Models default to Global-North, modern-leaning depictions under country-agnostic prompts; (2) I2I editing erodes cultural fidelity even when conventional metrics remain stable; (3) I2I models apply superficial cues rather than context-aware changes, often retaining source identity for Global-South targets.

Conclusion: Culture-sensitive edits remain unreliable in current generative image systems. The study provides a reproducible, culture-centered benchmark for diagnosing and tracking cultural bias in both T2I generation and I2I editing models.

Abstract: Generative image models produce striking visuals yet often misrepresent
culture. Prior work has examined cultural bias mainly in text-to-image (T2I)
systems, leaving image-to-image (I2I) editors underexplored. We bridge this gap
with a unified evaluation across six countries, an 8-category/36-subcategory
schema, and era-aware prompts, auditing both T2I generation and I2I editing
under a standardized protocol that yields comparable diagnostics. Using open
models with fixed settings, we derive cross-country, cross-era, and
cross-category evaluations. Our framework combines standard automatic metrics,
a culture-aware retrieval-augmented VQA, and expert human judgments collected
from native reviewers. To enable reproducibility, we release the complete image
corpus, prompts, and configurations. Our study reveals three findings: (1)
under country-agnostic prompts, models default to Global-North, modern-leaning
depictions that flatten cross-country distinctions; (2) iterative I2I editing
erodes cultural fidelity even when conventional metrics remain flat or improve;
and (3) I2I models apply superficial cues (palette shifts, generic props)
rather than era-consistent, context-aware changes, often retaining source
identity for Global-South targets. These results highlight that
culture-sensitive edits remain unreliable in current systems. By releasing
standardized data, prompts, and human evaluation protocols, we provide a
reproducible, culture-centered benchmark for diagnosing and tracking cultural
bias in generative image models.

### [9] [Filter-Based Reconstruction of Images from Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20071)
*Bernd Pfrommer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FIBAR is a simple filter-based method for reconstructing intensity images from event camera data, running efficiently on CPU without neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural network-based methods for event camera image reconstruction are complex and require GPUs. A simpler, asynchronous approach that works on standard CPUs is needed.

Method: Uses temporal IIR filter to integrate intensity changes from events, detects stale pixels with a novel algorithm, and applies Gaussian blur to reduce noise based on the assumption that absence of events indicates low gradient.

Result: Achieves 42-140 million events/s processing speed on laptop CPU, produces noisier reconstructions with ghost images compared to neural networks, but sufficient for tasks like fiducial marker detection.

Conclusion: FIBAR provides a simpler, efficient alternative to neural network methods for event camera image reconstruction, suitable for certain applications despite being noisier.

Abstract: Reconstructing an intensity image from the events of a moving event camera is
a challenging task that is typically approached with neural networks deployed
on graphics processing units. This paper presents a much simpler, FIlter Based
Asynchronous Reconstruction method (FIBAR). First, intensity changes signaled
by events are integrated with a temporal digital IIR filter. To reduce
reconstruction noise, stale pixels are detected by a novel algorithm that
regulates a window of recently updated pixels. Arguing that for a moving
camera, the absence of events at a pixel location likely implies a low image
gradient, stale pixels are then blurred with a Gaussian filter. In contrast to
most existing methods, FIBAR is asynchronous and permits image read-out at an
arbitrary time. It runs on a modern laptop CPU at about 42(140) million
events/s with (without) spatial filtering enabled. A few simple qualitative
experiments are presented that show the difference in image reconstruction
between FIBAR and a neural network-based approach (FireNet). FIBAR's
reconstruction is noisier than neural network-based methods and suffers from
ghost images. However, it is sufficient for certain tasks such as the detection
of fiducial markers. Code is available at

### [10] [Data-Adaptive Transformed Bilateral Tensor Low-Rank Representation for Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20077)
*Hui Chen,Xinjie Wang,Xianchao Xiu,Wanquan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TBTLRR is a novel tensor low-rank representation model that learns adaptive transformations and exploits bilateral structure for improved image clustering with better noise robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tensor low-rank representation methods rely on fixed transformations and have poor robustness to noise, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposes TBTLRR with data-adaptive tensor nuclear norm using learned unitary transforms, bilateral structure to capture local correlations, and ℓ₁/₂-norm + Frobenius norm regularization for complex noise handling. Uses ADMM-based optimization with theoretical convergence guarantees.

Result: Extensive experiments show TBTLRR achieves superior clustering performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating effectiveness in handling complex noise and capturing both global and local correlations.

Conclusion: TBTLRR provides a robust and effective tensor low-rank representation framework for image clustering that adapts to data characteristics and handles real-world noise better than existing approaches.

Abstract: Tensor low-rank representation (TLRR) has demonstrated significant success in
image clustering. However, most existing methods rely on fixed transformations
and suffer from poor robustness to noise. In this paper, we propose a novel
transformed bilateral tensor low-rank representation model called TBTLRR, which
introduces a data-adaptive tensor nuclear norm by learning arbitrary unitary
transforms, allowing for more effective capture of global correlations. In
addition, by leveraging the bilateral structure of latent tensor data, TBTLRR
is able to exploit local correlations between image samples and features.
Furthermore, TBTLRR integrates the $\ell_{1/2}$-norm and Frobenius norm
regularization terms for better dealing with complex noise in real-world
scenarios. To solve the proposed nonconvex model, we develop an efficient
optimization algorithm inspired by the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) and provide theoretical convergence. Extensive experiments
validate its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in clustering. The
code will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/TBTLRR.

*Lorenzo Arboit,Dennis N. Schneider,Britty Baby,Vinkle Srivastav,Pietro Mascagni,Nicolas Padoy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Endoshare is a source-available, cross-platform application for standardizing and de-identifying endoscopic videos in minimally invasive surgery, addressing privacy concerns and heterogeneous recording formats in surgical video analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video-based assessment and surgical data science are limited by heterogeneous recording formats and privacy concerns associated with video sharing, hindering widespread adoption in surgical training, research, and quality improvement.

Method: Developed using software development life cycle with iterative user-centered feedback. Used privacy-by-design architecture based on usability heuristics survey. Tested with clinicians and computer scientists using Technology Acceptance Model constructs and benchmarking across different hardware configurations.

Result: High usability scores from clinicians (4.68/5) and computer scientists (4.03/5), with surgeons reporting high perceived usefulness (5.07/7), ease of use (5.15/7), heuristic usability (4.38/5), and strong recommendation (9.20/10). Processing time varied with mode, video duration, and computational power.

Conclusion: Endoshare provides a transparent, user-friendly pipeline for standardized, privacy-preserving surgical video management, though compliance certification and broader interoperability validation are needed for deployment as an alternative to proprietary systems.

Abstract: Video-based assessment and surgical data science can advance surgical
training, research, and quality improvement. However, widespread use remains
limited by heterogeneous recording formats and privacy concerns associated with
video sharing. We present Endoshare, a source-available, cross-platform
application for merging, standardizing, and de-identifying endoscopic videos in
minimally invasive surgery. Development followed the software development life
cycle with iterative, user-centered feedback. During the analysis phase, an
internal survey of clinicians and computer scientists based on ten usability
heuristics identified key requirements that guided a privacy-by-design
architecture. In the testing phase, an external clinician survey combined the
same heuristics with Technology Acceptance Model constructs to assess usability
and adoption, complemented by benchmarking across different hardware
configurations. Four clinicians and four computer scientists initially tested
the prototype, reporting high usability (4.68 +/- 0.40/5 and 4.03 +/- 0.51/5),
with the lowest score (4.00 +/- 0.93/5) relating to label clarity. After
refinement, the testing phase surveyed ten surgeons who reported high perceived
usefulness (5.07 +/- 1.75/7), ease of use (5.15 +/- 1.71/7), heuristic
usability (4.38 +/- 0.48/5), and strong recommendation (9.20 +/- 0.79/10).
Processing time varied with processing mode, video duration (both p <= 0.001),
and machine computational power (p = 0.041). Endoshare provides a transparent,
user-friendly pipeline for standardized, privacy-preserving surgical video
management. Compliance certification and broader interoperability validation
are needed to establish it as a deployable alternative to proprietary systems.

### [12] [Attentive Convolution: Unifying the Expressivity of Self-Attention with Convolutional Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20092)
*Hao Yu,Haoyu Chen,Yan Jiang,Wei Peng,Zhaodong Sun,Samuel Kaski,Guoying Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Attentive Convolution (ATConv), a novel convolutional operator that incorporates adaptive routing and lateral inhibition principles from self-attention, achieving superior performance to SA mechanisms while maintaining linear complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the performance gap between self-attention and convolutions by identifying and incorporating the key principles that give SA its expressive power over traditional convolutions.

Method: Proposed ATConv, which reformulates convolutional operator with two key principles: adaptive routing (dynamic regulation of positional information flow based on semantic content) and lateral inhibition (score competition that suppresses redundancy and sharpens representations).

Result: ATConv with only 3×3 kernels consistently outperforms various SA mechanisms in vision tasks. AttNet (CNN family based on ATConv) achieves 84.4% ImageNet-1K Top-1 accuracy with 27M parameters. In diffusion models, replacing SA with ATConv reduces ImageNet FID by 0.15 with faster sampling.

Conclusion: ATConv successfully captures the intrinsic expressivity of self-attention while maintaining the efficiency advantages of convolutions, offering a promising alternative to SA for practical vision applications.

Abstract: Self-attention (SA) has become the cornerstone of modern vision backbones for
its powerful expressivity over traditional Convolutions (Conv). However, its
quadratic complexity remains a critical bottleneck for practical applications.
Given that Conv offers linear complexity and strong visual priors, continuing
efforts have been made to promote the renaissance of Conv. However, a
persistent performance chasm remains, highlighting that these modernizations
have not yet captured the intrinsic expressivity that defines SA. In this
paper, we re-examine the design of the CNNs, directed by a key question: what
principles give SA its edge over Conv? As a result, we reveal two fundamental
insights that challenge the long-standing design intuitions in prior research
(e.g., Receptive field). The two findings are: (1) \textit{Adaptive routing}:
SA dynamically regulates positional information flow according to semantic
content, whereas Conv employs static kernels uniformly across all positions.
(2) \textit{Lateral inhibition}: SA induces score competition among token
weighting, effectively suppressing redundancy and sharpening representations,
whereas Conv filters lack such inhibitory dynamics and exhibit considerable
redundancy. Based on this, we propose \textit{Attentive Convolution} (ATConv),
a principled reformulation of the convolutional operator that intrinsically
injects these principles. Interestingly, with only $3\times3$ kernels, ATConv
consistently outperforms various SA mechanisms in fundamental vision tasks.
Building on ATConv, we introduce AttNet, a CNN family that can attain
\textbf{84.4\%} ImageNet-1K Top-1 accuracy with only 27M parameters. In
diffusion-based image generation, replacing all SA with the proposed $3\times
3$ ATConv in SiT-XL/2 reduces ImageNet FID by 0.15 in 400k steps with faster
sampling. Code is available at: github.com/price112/Attentive-Convolution.

### [13] [StableSketcher: Enhancing Diffusion Model for Pixel-based Sketch Generation via Visual Question Answering Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20093)
*Jiho Park,Sieun Choi,Jaeyoon Seo,Jihie Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StableSketcher is a novel framework that enables diffusion models to generate high-quality hand-drawn sketches with improved text-image alignment using optimized latent decoding and visual question answering-based reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models struggle with synthesizing pixel-based human-drawn sketches, which represent abstract expression, due to limitations in capturing sketch characteristics and maintaining text-image alignment.

Method: Fine-tuned variational autoencoder for optimized latent decoding to better capture sketch characteristics, and integrated a new reward function for reinforcement learning based on visual question answering to improve text-image alignment and semantic consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments show StableSketcher generates sketches with improved stylistic fidelity and better alignment with prompts compared to Stable Diffusion baseline. Also introduced SketchDUO, the first dataset with instance-level sketches paired with captions and question-answer pairs.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses challenges in sketch generation by combining optimized latent decoding with visual question answering-based reinforcement learning, while also providing a valuable new dataset for future research.

Abstract: Although recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly enriched
the quality of generated images, challenges remain in synthesizing pixel-based
human-drawn sketches, a representative example of abstract expression. To
combat these challenges, we propose StableSketcher, a novel framework that
empowers diffusion models to generate hand-drawn sketches with high prompt
fidelity. Within this framework, we fine-tune the variational autoencoder to
optimize latent decoding, enabling it to better capture the characteristics of
sketches. In parallel, we integrate a new reward function for reinforcement
learning based on visual question answering, which improves text-image
alignment and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
StableSketcher generates sketches with improved stylistic fidelity, achieving
better alignment with prompts compared to the Stable Diffusion baseline.
Additionally, we introduce SketchDUO, to the best of our knowledge, the first

*Ziheng Zhang,Xinyue Ma,Arpita Chowdhury,Elizabeth G. Campolongo,Matthew J. Thompson,Net Zhang,Samuel Stevens,Hilmar Lapp,Tanya Berger-Wolf,Yu Su,Wei-Lun Chao,Jianyang Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces BIOCAP, a biological foundation model that uses synthetic descriptive captions generated by MLLMs to enhance multimodal learning, improving species classification and text-image retrieval by aligning images and captions in a shared latent morphospace.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage descriptive captions as additional supervision for biological multimodal foundation models, addressing the challenge of obtaining faithful, instance-specific captions at scale in organismal biology.

Method: Generate synthetic captions using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) guided by Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples, then train BIOCAP (BIOCLIP with Captions) using these captions.

Result: BIOCAP captures rich semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and text-image retrieval, demonstrating the value of descriptive captions beyond labels.

Conclusion: Descriptive captions are valuable for bridging biological images with multimodal foundation models, emphasizing diagnostic characters while suppressing spurious correlations through alignment with shared latent structure.

Abstract: This work investigates descriptive captions as an additional source of
supervision for biological multimodal foundation models. Images and captions
can be viewed as complementary samples from the latent morphospace of a
species, each capturing certain biological traits. Incorporating captions
during training encourages alignment with this shared latent structure,
emphasizing potentially diagnostic characters while suppressing spurious
correlations. The main challenge, however, lies in obtaining faithful,
instance-specific captions at scale. This requirement has limited the
utilization of natural language supervision in organismal biology compared with
many other scientific domains. We complement this gap by generating synthetic
captions with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by
Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples. These
domain-specific contexts help reduce hallucination and yield accurate,
instance-based descriptive captions. Using these captions, we train BIOCAP
(i.e., BIOCLIP with Captions), a biological foundation model that captures rich
semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and
text-image retrieval. These results demonstrate the value of descriptive
captions beyond labels in bridging biological images with multimodal foundation
models.

*Hyunjun Jung,Hae-Gon Jeon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes inverse image-based rendering for light field generation from single images using neural rendering with cross-attention to reconstruct light flows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the computational costs and specialized hardware requirements of traditional light field acquisition methods, making light field technology more accessible.

Method: Neural rendering pipeline that stores light flow from source rays, computes relationships via cross-attention, predicts target ray colors, and iteratively generates novel views while updating occluded content.

Result: Works well on various challenging datasets without retraining, outperforms state-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods.

Conclusion: Inverse image-based rendering enables effective light field generation from single images, broadening the applicability of light field technology.

Abstract: A concept of light-fields computed from multiple view images on regular grids
has proven its benefit for scene representations, and supported realistic
renderings of novel views and photographic effects such as refocusing and
shallow depth of field. In spite of its effectiveness of light flow
computations, obtaining light fields requires either computational costs or
specialized devices like a bulky camera setup and a specialized microlens
array. In an effort to broaden its benefit and applicability, in this paper, we
propose a novel view synthesis method for light field generation from only
single images, named inverse image-based rendering. Unlike previous attempts to
implicitly rebuild 3D geometry or to explicitly represent objective scenes, our
method reconstructs light flows in a space from image pixels, which behaves in
the opposite way to image-based rendering. To accomplish this, we design a
neural rendering pipeline to render a target ray in an arbitrary viewpoint. Our
neural renderer first stores the light flow of source rays from the input
image, then computes the relationships among them through cross-attention, and
finally predicts the color of the target ray based on these relationships.
After the rendering pipeline generates the first novel view from a single input
image, the generated out-of-view contents are updated to the set of source
rays. This procedure is iteratively performed while ensuring the consistent
generation of occluded contents. We demonstrate that our inverse image-based
rendering works well with various challenging datasets without any retraining
or finetuning after once trained on synthetic dataset, and outperforms relevant
state-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LogitGap is a novel post-hoc OOD detection method that exploits the relationship between maximum logit and remaining logits to enhance ID/OOD separability, with a training-free strategy to identify informative logits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing post-hoc OOD detection methods often underexploit the rich information in model's logits space, limiting their effectiveness in distinguishing in-distribution from out-of-distribution samples.

Method: Proposes LogitGap which explicitly uses the gap between maximum logit and remaining logits, with a training-free strategy to automatically identify the most informative logits for scoring without requiring additional training.

Result: Extensive experiments on vision-language and vision-only models show LogitGap consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse OOD detection scenarios and benchmarks.

Conclusion: LogitGap effectively enhances OOD detection by better utilizing logit space information, providing both theoretical analysis and empirical validation of its superior performance.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models in open-world applications. While post-hoc methods are
favored for their efficiency and ease of deployment, existing approaches often
underexploit the rich information embedded in the model's logits space. In this
paper, we propose LogitGap, a novel post-hoc OOD detection method that
explicitly exploits the relationship between the maximum logit and the
remaining logits to enhance the separability between in-distribution (ID) and
OOD samples. To further improve its effectiveness, we refine LogitGap by
focusing on a more compact and informative subset of the logit space.
Specifically, we introduce a training-free strategy that automatically
identifies the most informative logits for scoring. We provide both theoretical
analysis and empirical evidence to validate the effectiveness of our approach.
Extensive experiments on both vision-language and vision-only models
demonstrate that LogitGap consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance
across diverse OOD detection scenarios and benchmarks. Code is available at

Motivation: Existing 3D part datasets like PartNet have limitations including untextured geometries and expert-dependent annotation, which restrict scalability and usability for advancing part understanding in computer vision.

Method: Created PartNeXt dataset with scalable annotation pipeline, texture-aware labels, and hierarchical part organization. Benchmarked on class-agnostic part segmentation and introduced new 3D part-centric question answering task.

Result: State-of-the-art methods struggle with fine-grained parts on PartNeXt. Training Point-SAM on PartNeXt yields substantial improvements over PartNet. 3D-LLMs show significant gaps in open-vocabulary part grounding.

Conclusion: PartNeXt enables new research directions in structured 3D understanding through its scalable annotation, texture-aware labels, and multi-task evaluation capabilities.

Abstract: Understanding objects at the level of their constituent parts is fundamental
to advancing computer vision, graphics, and robotics. While datasets like
PartNet have driven progress in 3D part understanding, their reliance on
untextured geometries and expert-dependent annotation limits scalability and
usability. We introduce PartNeXt, a next-generation dataset addressing these
gaps with over 23,000 high-quality, textured 3D models annotated with
fine-grained, hierarchical part labels across 50 categories. We benchmark
PartNeXt on two tasks: (1) class-agnostic part segmentation, where
state-of-the-art methods (e.g., PartField, SAMPart3D) struggle with
fine-grained and leaf-level parts, and (2) 3D part-centric question answering,
a new benchmark for 3D-LLMs that reveals significant gaps in open-vocabulary
part grounding. Additionally, training Point-SAM on PartNeXt yields substantial
gains over PartNet, underscoring the dataset's superior quality and diversity.
By combining scalable annotation, texture-aware labels, and multi-task
evaluation, PartNeXt opens new avenues for research in structured 3D

### [19] [Monocular Visual 8D Pose Estimation for Articulated Bicycles and Cyclists](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20158)
*Eduardo R. Corral-Soto,Yang Liu,Yuan Ren,Bai Dongfeng,Liu Bingbing*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an 8D pose estimation method for articulated bicycles and cyclists from single RGB images, extending beyond traditional 6D pose by estimating steering handle and pedal rotations to better capture bicycle articulation and intended travel direction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cyclists are vulnerable road users in autonomous driving, and accurate pose estimation is critical for intention classification and collision avoidance. Traditional 6D pose methods are insufficient for articulated bicycles because varying steering/pedal angles change the 3D bounding box and orientation may not align with actual travel direction.

Method: The proposed model jointly estimates 8D pose (3D translation, 3D rotation, plus steering handle and pedal rotations) and 3D keypoints of articulated bicycles. It uses a mix of synthetic and real image data for training to generalize on real images.

Result: The method achieves competitive scores compared to state-of-the-art category-level 6D pose estimators that use rigid canonical object templates, showing promising results for 8D pose parameter accuracy.

Conclusion: The 8D pose estimation approach enables more fine-grained bicycle pose state and travel direction estimation, addressing limitations of rigid object pose estimation for articulated bicycles in autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: In Autonomous Driving, cyclists belong to the safety-critical class of
Vulnerable Road Users (VRU), and accurate estimation of their pose is critical
for cyclist crossing intention classification, behavior prediction, and
collision avoidance. Unlike rigid objects, articulated bicycles are composed of
movable rigid parts linked by joints and constrained by a kinematic structure.
6D pose methods can estimate the 3D rotation and translation of rigid bicycles,
but 6D becomes insufficient when the steering/pedals angles of the bicycle
vary. That is because: 1) varying the articulated pose of the bicycle causes
its 3D bounding box to vary as well, and 2) the 3D box orientation is not
necessarily aligned to the orientation of the steering which determines the
actual intended travel direction. In this work, we introduce a method for
category-level 8D pose estimation for articulated bicycles and cyclists from a
single RGB image. Besides being able to estimate the 3D translation and
rotation of a bicycle from a single image, our method also estimates the
rotations of its steering handles and pedals with respect to the bicycle body
frame. These two new parameters enable the estimation of a more fine-grained
bicycle pose state and travel direction. Our proposed model jointly estimates
the 8D pose and the 3D Keypoints of articulated bicycles, and trains with a mix
of synthetic and real image data to generalize on real images. We include an
evaluation section where we evaluate the accuracy of our estimated 8D pose
parameters, and our method shows promising results by achieving competitive
scores when compared against state-of-the-art category-level 6D pose estimators
that use rigid canonical object templates for matching.

*Xudong Yan,Songhe Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel approach for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning that uses multimodal knowledge accumulation from unsupervised data to update prototypes at test time, addressing distribution shift issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CZSL methods suffer from performance degradation due to distribution shift when unseen attribute-object compositions appear at test time.

Method: Proposes accumulating comprehensive knowledge from textual and visual modalities using unsupervised data to update multimodal prototypes, with adaptive update weights and dynamic priority queue for high-confidence images, plus multimodal collaborative representation learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets under both closed-world and open-world settings.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively handles distribution shift in CZSL by leveraging multimodal knowledge accumulation and adaptive prototype updating.

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel
attribute-object compositions based on the knowledge learned from seen ones.
Existing methods suffer from performance degradation caused by the distribution
shift of label space at test time, which stems from the inclusion of unseen
compositions recombined from attributes and objects. To overcome the challenge,
we propose a novel approach that accumulates comprehensive knowledge in both
textual and visual modalities from unsupervised data to update multimodal
prototypes at test time. Building on this, we further design an adaptive update
weight to control the degree of prototype adjustment, enabling the model to
flexibly adapt to distribution shift during testing. Moreover, a dynamic
priority queue is introduced that stores high-confidence images to acquire
visual knowledge from historical images for inference. Considering the semantic
consistency of multimodal knowledge, we align textual and visual prototypes by
multimodal collaborative representation learning. Extensive experiments
indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four
benchmark datasets under both closed-world and open-world settings. Code will
be available at https://github.com/xud-yan/TOMCAT .

TL;DR: IB-GAN is a new unsupervised GAN model that uses Information Bottleneck framework for disentangled representation learning, achieving competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve disentangled representation learning in GANs by applying Information Bottleneck framework to constrain mutual information between input and output.

Method: Uses intermediate stochastic layer in generator to constrain mutual information, creating learnable latent distribution trained end-to-end with generator.

Result: Achieves competitive disentanglement scores on dSprites datasets, outperforms InfoGAN, and generates better quality/diverse samples on CelebA and 3D Chairs datasets.

Conclusion: IB-GAN successfully enables disentangled and interpretable latent space learning while maintaining high sample quality and diversity.

Abstract: We propose a new GAN-based unsupervised model for disentangled representation
learning. The new model is discovered in an attempt to utilize the Information
Bottleneck (IB) framework to the optimization of GAN, thereby named IB-GAN. The
architecture of IB-GAN is partially similar to that of InfoGAN but has a
critical difference; an intermediate layer of the generator is leveraged to
constrain the mutual information between the input and the generated output.
The intermediate stochastic layer can serve as a learnable latent distribution
that is trained with the generator jointly in an end-to-end fashion. As a
result, the generator of IB-GAN can harness the latent space in a disentangled
and interpretable manner. With the experiments on dSprites and Color-dSprites
dataset, we demonstrate that IB-GAN achieves competitive disentanglement scores
to those of state-of-the-art \b{eta}-VAEs and outperforms InfoGAN. Moreover,
the visual quality and the diversity of samples generated by IB-GAN are often
better than those by \b{eta}-VAEs and Info-GAN in terms of FID score on CelebA
and 3D Chairs dataset.

TL;DR: A radar-camera fusion framework for Multi-Object Tracking that uses online calibration and common features to improve tracking accuracy and reduce manual intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many existing studies underutilize radar's capabilities by assigning it a supplementary role, despite its ability to provide accurate range/depth information in 3D coordinates.

Method: Uses online radar-camera calibration with common features, feature matching, and category-consistency checking to associate detections from both sensors and derive real-world object positions.

Result: The framework streamlines radar-camera mapping process and improves tracking precision, as demonstrated in both controlled environments and actual traffic scenarios.

Conclusion: This work presents the first investigation of integrating radar-camera common features with online calibration for MOT, achieving enhanced tracking efficiency with minimal manual interventions.

Abstract: This paper presents a Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) framework that fuses radar
and camera data to enhance tracking efficiency while minimizing manual
interventions. Contrary to many studies that underutilize radar and assign it a
supplementary role--despite its capability to provide accurate range/depth
information of targets in a world 3D coordinate system--our approach positions
radar in a crucial role. Meanwhile, this paper utilizes common features to
enable online calibration to autonomously associate detections from radar and
camera. The main contributions of this work include: (1) the development of a
radar-camera fusion MOT framework that exploits online radar-camera calibration
to simplify the integration of detection results from these two sensors, (2)
the utilization of common features between radar and camera data to accurately
derive real-world positions of detected objects, and (3) the adoption of
feature matching and category-consistency checking to surpass the limitations
of mere position matching in enhancing sensor association accuracy. To the best
of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the integration of
radar-camera common features and their use in online calibration for achieving
MOT. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated by its ability to streamline
the radar-camera mapping process and improve tracking precision, as evidenced
by real-world experiments conducted in both controlled environments and actual
traffic scenarios. Code is available at

TL;DR: PPMStereo introduces a Pick-and-Play Memory module for temporally consistent stereo depth estimation from video, achieving state-of-the-art performance with efficient computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temporally consistent depth estimation from stereo video is critical for real-world applications like augmented reality, but existing methods face a fundamental trade-off between limited temporal modeling and high computational costs for long-range dependencies.

Method: Proposes a two-stage Pick-and-Play Memory (PPM) module inspired by human decision-making: a 'pick' process that identifies the most relevant frames and a 'play' process that weights selected frames adaptively for spatio-temporal aggregation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 0.62/1.11 TEPE on Sintel clean/final datasets (17.3% & 9.02% improvements over BiDAStereo) while requiring fewer computational costs.

Conclusion: PPMStereo effectively maintains a compact yet highly informative memory buffer for temporally consistent information aggregation, demonstrating superior accuracy and temporal consistency in stereo video depth estimation.

Abstract: Temporally consistent depth estimation from stereo video is critical for
real-world applications such as augmented reality, where inconsistent depth
estimation disrupts the immersion of users. Despite its importance, this task
remains challenging due to the difficulty in modeling long-term temporal
consistency in a computationally efficient manner. Previous methods attempt to
address this by aggregating spatio-temporal information but face a fundamental
trade-off: limited temporal modeling provides only modest gains, whereas
capturing long-range dependencies significantly increases computational cost.
To address this limitation, we introduce a memory buffer for modeling
long-range spatio-temporal consistency while achieving efficient dynamic stereo
matching. Inspired by the two-stage decision-making process in humans, we
propose a \textbf{P}ick-and-\textbf{P}lay \textbf{M}emory (PPM) construction
module for dynamic \textbf{Stereo} matching, dubbed as \textbf{PPMStereo}. PPM
consists of a `pick' process that identifies the most relevant frames and a
`play' process that weights the selected frames adaptively for spatio-temporal
aggregation. This two-stage collaborative process maintains a compact yet
highly informative memory buffer while achieving temporally consistent
information aggregation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of
PPMStereo, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
temporal consistency. % Notably, PPMStereo achieves 0.62/1.11 TEPE on the
Sintel clean/final (17.3\% \& 9.02\% improvements over BiDAStereo) with fewer
computational costs. Codes are available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation benchmarks focus on individual subjects rather than scenes with multiple interacting people, leaving the plausibility of multi-agent dynamics in generated videos unverified.

Method: For I2V, leverage start frames from established datasets for ground truth comparison. For T2V, develop a prompt suite for diverse pedestrian densities and interactions. Use a method to reconstruct 2D bird's-eye view trajectories from pixel-space without known camera parameters.

Result: Leading models have learned surprisingly effective priors for plausible multi-agent behavior, but show failure modes like merging and disappearing people.

Conclusion: The evaluation reveals both strengths and weaknesses in current video generation models' ability to simulate pedestrian dynamics, highlighting areas for future improvement.

Abstract: Large-scale video generation models have demonstrated high visual realism in
diverse contexts, spurring interest in their potential as general-purpose world
simulators. Existing benchmarks focus on individual subjects rather than scenes
with multiple interacting people. However, the plausibility of multi-agent
dynamics in generated videos remains unverified. We propose a rigorous
evaluation protocol to benchmark text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V)
models as implicit simulators of pedestrian dynamics. For I2V, we leverage
start frames from established datasets to enable comparison with a ground truth

densities and interactions. A key component is a method to reconstruct 2D
bird's-eye view trajectories from pixel-space without known camera parameters.
Our analysis reveals that leading models have learned surprisingly effective
priors for plausible multi-agent behavior. However, failure modes like merging

TL;DR: SPAN introduces continuous regression for temporal intention localization instead of discrete classification, modeling suspicion as a temporal process with long-term dependencies and cumulative effects using temporal point process theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing discrete classification methods fail to capture the continuous nature of suspicious intentions, limiting early intervention and explainability in video surveillance applications.

Method: Proposes Suspicion Progression Analysis Network (SPAN) with suspicion score formula, Suspicion Coefficient Modulation using multimodal information, and Concept-Anchored Mapping to link actions to intention concepts.

Result: SPAN significantly outperforms existing methods on HAI dataset, reducing MSE by 19.8% and improving average mAP by 1.78%, with 2.74% mAP gain in low-frequency cases.

Conclusion: Continuous suspicion modeling enables earlier detection and proactive intervention, greatly enhancing system explainability and practical utility in security applications compared to discrete classification.

Abstract: Temporal Intention Localization (TIL) is crucial for video surveillance,
focusing on identifying varying levels of suspicious intentions to improve
security monitoring. However, existing discrete classification methods fail to
capture the continuous nature of suspicious intentions, limiting early
intervention and explainability. In this paper, we propose the Suspicion
Progression Analysis Network (SPAN), which shifts from discrete classification
to continuous regression, enabling the capture of fluctuating and evolving
suspicious intentions. We reveal that suspicion exhibits long-term dependencies
and cumulative effects, similar to Temporal Point Process (TPP) theory. Based
on these insights, we define a suspicion score formula that models continuous
changes while accounting for temporal characteristics. We also introduce
Suspicion Coefficient Modulation, which adjusts suspicion coefficients using
multimodal information to reflect the varying impacts of suspicious actions.
Additionally, the Concept-Anchored Mapping method is proposed to link
suspicious actions to predefined intention concepts, offering insights into
both the actions and their potential underlying intentions. Extensive
experiments on the HAI dataset show that SPAN significantly outperforms
existing methods, reducing MSE by 19.8% and improving average mAP by 1.78%.
Notably, SPAN achieves a 2.74% mAP gain in low-frequency cases, demonstrating
its superior ability to capture subtle behavioral changes. Compared to discrete
classification systems, our continuous suspicion modeling approach enables
earlier detection and proactive intervention, greatly enhancing system
explainability and practical utility in security applications.

TL;DR: Analysis of 54 public brain MRI datasets reveals significant data heterogeneity and preprocessing variability that impact foundation model development, with residual covariate shift persisting even after standardization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically assess the scale, diversity, and consistency of brain MRI data for foundation model development, as these factors critically influence model performance but remain under-evaluated.

Method: Multi-level analysis including dataset-level characterization of modality composition and disease coverage, image-level quantification of voxel properties, evaluation of preprocessing variability, and feature-space case study using 3D DenseNet121.

Result: Revealed strong imbalances between healthy and clinical populations, substantial heterogeneity in voxel properties, and measurable residual covariate shift after standardized preprocessing that harmonization alone cannot eliminate.

Conclusion: Public brain MRI resources exhibit significant variability requiring preprocessing-aware and domain-adaptive strategies for developing generalizable foundation models.

Abstract: The development of foundation models for brain MRI depends critically on the
scale, diversity, and consistency of available data, yet systematic assessments
of these factors remain scarce. In this study, we analyze 54 publicly
accessible brain MRI datasets encompassing over 538,031 to provide a
structured, multi-level overview tailored to foundation model development. At
the dataset level, we characterize modality composition, disease coverage, and
dataset scale, revealing strong imbalances between large healthy cohorts and
smaller clinical populations. At the image level, we quantify voxel spacing,
orientation, and intensity distributions across 15 representative datasets,
demonstrating substantial heterogeneity that can influence representation
learning. We then perform a quantitative evaluation of preprocessing
variability, examining how intensity normalization, bias field correction,
skull stripping, spatial registration, and interpolation alter voxel statistics
and geometry. While these steps improve within-dataset consistency, residual
differences persist between datasets. Finally, feature-space case study using a
3D DenseNet121 shows measurable residual covariate shift after standardized
preprocessing, confirming that harmonization alone cannot eliminate
inter-dataset bias. Together, these analyses provide a unified characterization
of variability in public brain MRI resources and emphasize the need for
preprocessing-aware and domain-adaptive strategies in the design of
generalizable brain MRI foundation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAPO++ is a cross-stage prompt optimization framework for text-to-video generation that enhances user prompts through retrieval-augmented refinement, test-time iterative scaling, and LLM fine-tuning, achieving significant improvements in video quality without modifying the underlying generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User-provided prompts for text-to-video generation are often short, unstructured, and misaligned with training data, limiting the potential of diffusion-based T2V models. Current methods fail to effectively bridge this gap between user intent and model capabilities.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) RAPO enriches prompts with semantically relevant modifiers from a relation graph and refactors them to match training distributions; 2) SSPO iteratively refines prompts using multi-source feedback (semantic alignment, spatial fidelity, temporal coherence, optical flow); 3) Fine-tunes LLM on optimized prompt pairs to internalize optimization patterns.

Result: Extensive experiments across five state-of-the-art T2V models and five benchmarks show significant gains in semantic alignment, compositional reasoning, temporal stability, and physical plausibility, outperforming existing methods by large margins.

Conclusion: RAPO++ is a model-agnostic, cost-efficient, and scalable solution that sets a new standard for prompt optimization in T2V generation, enhancing video quality without modifying the underlying generative backbone.

Abstract: Prompt design plays a crucial role in text-to-video (T2V) generation, yet
user-provided prompts are often short, unstructured, and misaligned with
training data, limiting the generative potential of diffusion-based T2V models.
We present \textbf{RAPO++}, a cross-stage prompt optimization framework that
unifies training-data--aligned refinement, test-time iterative scaling, and
large language model (LLM) fine-tuning to substantially improve T2V generation
without modifying the underlying generative backbone. In \textbf{Stage 1},
Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Optimization (RAPO) enriches user prompts with
semantically relevant modifiers retrieved from a relation graph and refactors
them to match training distributions, enhancing compositionality and
multi-object fidelity. \textbf{Stage 2} introduces Sample-Specific Prompt
Optimization (SSPO), a closed-loop mechanism that iteratively refines prompts
using multi-source feedback -- including semantic alignment, spatial fidelity,
temporal coherence, and task-specific signals such as optical flow -- yielding
progressively improved video generation quality. \textbf{Stage 3} leverages
optimized prompt pairs from SSPO to fine-tune the rewriter LLM, internalizing
task-specific optimization patterns and enabling efficient, high-quality prompt
generation even before inference. Extensive experiments across five
state-of-the-art T2V models and five benchmarks demonstrate that RAPO++
achieves significant gains in semantic alignment, compositional reasoning,
temporal stability, and physical plausibility, outperforming existing methods
by large margins. Our results highlight RAPO++ as a model-agnostic,
cost-efficient, and scalable solution that sets a new standard for prompt
optimization in T2V generation. The code is available at

### [28] [FlowCycle: Pursuing Cycle-Consistent Flows for Text-based Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20212)
*Yanghao Wang,Zhen Wang,Long Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowCycle is a novel text-to-image editing framework that introduces target-aware intermediate states through learnable noise optimization, enabling faithful modifications while preserving source consistency without inversion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-based image editing methods use target-agnostic intermediate states that focus on source reconstruction but neglect semantic gaps towards editing targets, resulting in limited editability or inconsistency when modifications deviate substantially from the source.

Method: FlowCycle parameterizes corruption with learnable noises and optimizes them through a cycle-consistent process with dual consistency constraints, iteratively editing source to target and recovering back to source to produce target-aware intermediate states.

Result: Extensive ablations demonstrate that FlowCycle achieves superior editing quality and consistency over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The target-aware intermediate state approach enables faithful modifications while preserving source consistency, addressing limitations of current corruption-then-restoration paradigms in text-to-image editing.

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained text-to-image flow models have enabled
remarkable progress in text-based image editing. Mainstream approaches always
adopt a corruption-then-restoration paradigm, where the source image is first
corrupted into an ``intermediate state'' and then restored to the target image
under the prompt guidance. However, current methods construct this intermediate
state in a target-agnostic manner, i.e., they primarily focus on realizing
source image reconstruction while neglecting the semantic gaps towards the
specific editing target. This design inherently results in limited editability
or inconsistency when the desired modifications substantially deviate from the
source. In this paper, we argue that the intermediate state should be
target-aware, i.e., selectively corrupting editing-relevant contents while
preserving editing-irrelevant ones. To this end, we propose FlowCycle, a novel
inversion-free and flow-based editing framework that parameterizes corruption
with learnable noises and optimizes them through a cycle-consistent process. By
iteratively editing the source to the target and recovering back to the source
with dual consistency constraints, FlowCycle learns to produce a target-aware
intermediate state, enabling faithful modifications while preserving source
consistency. Extensive ablations have demonstrated that FlowCycle achieves
superior editing quality and consistency over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: CURL is a self-supervised learning framework using contrastive learning for fetal movement detection from ultrasound videos, achieving 78.01% sensitivity and 81.60% AUROC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fetal movement detection methods like maternal perception and cardiotocography are subjective and inaccurate, requiring objective automated solutions for prenatal health assessment.

Method: Proposes Contrastive Ultrasound Video Representation Learning (CURL) with dual-contrastive loss (spatial and temporal), task-specific sampling strategy, and probabilistic fine-tuning for long recordings.

Result: Achieved 78.01% sensitivity and 81.60% AUROC on 92 subjects with 30-minute ultrasound sessions, demonstrating reliable fetal movement detection.

Conclusion: CURL shows potential for objective fetal movement analysis using self-supervised contrastive learning, improving prenatal monitoring and clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Accurate fetal movement (FM) detection is essential for assessing prenatal
health, as abnormal movement patterns can indicate underlying complications
such as placental dysfunction or fetal distress. Traditional methods, including
maternal perception and cardiotocography (CTG), suffer from subjectivity and
limited accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Contrastive
Ultrasound Video Representation Learning (CURL), a novel self-supervised
learning framework for FM detection from extended fetal ultrasound video
recordings. Our approach leverages a dual-contrastive loss, incorporating both
spatial and temporal contrastive learning, to learn robust motion
representations. Additionally, we introduce a task-specific sampling strategy,
ensuring the effective separation of movement and non-movement segments during
self-supervised training, while enabling flexible inference on arbitrarily long
ultrasound recordings through a probabilistic fine-tuning approach. Evaluated
on an in-house dataset of 92 subjects, each with 30-minute ultrasound sessions,
CURL achieves a sensitivity of 78.01% and an AUROC of 81.60%, demonstrating its
potential for reliable and objective FM analysis. These results highlight the
potential of self-supervised contrastive learning for fetal movement analysis,
paving the way for improved prenatal monitoring and clinical decision-making.

*Jiahuan Wang,Yuxin Chen,Jun Yu,Guangming Lu,Wenjie Pei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EditInfinity adapts VQ-based generative models for text-driven image editing by leveraging exact intermediate quantized representations for precise image inversion, overcoming limitations of diffusion models' approximation errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based image editing methods suffer from approximation errors during image inversion due to lack of exact supervision in intermediate generative steps, limiting editing performance.

Method: Proposes EditInfinity which adapts Infinity (binary-quantized generative model) with efficient image inversion mechanism integrating text prompting rectification and image style preservation, plus holistic smoothing strategy.

Result: Superior performance on PIE-Bench benchmark across "add", "change", and "delete" editing operations compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based baselines.

Conclusion: VQ-based generative models with exact intermediate representations enable more precise image inversion and editing, achieving better fidelity to source images and semantic alignment with text prompts.

Abstract: Adapting pretrained diffusion-based generative models for text-driven image
editing with negligible tuning overhead has demonstrated remarkable potential.
A classical adaptation paradigm, as followed by these methods, first infers the
generative trajectory inversely for a given source image by image inversion,
then performs image editing along the inferred trajectory guided by the target
text prompts. However, the performance of image editing is heavily limited by
the approximation errors introduced during image inversion by diffusion models,
which arise from the absence of exact supervision in the intermediate
generative steps. To circumvent this issue, we investigate the
parameter-efficient adaptation of VQ-based generative models for image editing,
and leverage their inherent characteristic that the exact intermediate
quantized representations of a source image are attainable, enabling more
effective supervision for precise image inversion. Specifically, we propose
\emph{EditInfinity}, which adapts \emph{Infinity}, a binary-quantized
generative model, for image editing. We propose an efficient yet effective
image inversion mechanism that integrates text prompting rectification and
image style preservation, enabling precise image inversion. Furthermore, we
devise a holistic smoothing strategy which allows our \emph{EditInfinity} to
perform image editing with high fidelity to source images and precise semantic
alignment to the text prompts. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench benchmark
across "add", "change", and "delete" editing operations, demonstrate the
superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based
baselines. Code available at: https://github.com/yx-chen-ust/EditInfinity.

### [31] [Why LVLMs Are More Prone to Hallucinations in Longer Responses: The Role of Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20229)
*Ge Zheng,Jiaye Qian,Jiajin Tang,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel "induce-detect-suppress" framework to address hallucinations in LVLMs' longer responses, showing that hallucinations stem from increased context reliance rather than length itself.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models suffer from hallucination issues, particularly in longer responses, with current understanding attributing this to accumulated uncertainties from length. The paper investigates whether there's a deeper mechanism beyond just length-induced errors.

Method: Proposes an "induce-detect-suppress" framework: actively induces hallucinations through designed contexts, uses induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases, and suppresses object-level hallucinations during decoding.

Result: Achieves consistent, significant improvements across all benchmarks, demonstrating strong detection capabilities and improved hallucination mitigation.

Conclusion: The study validates that hallucination risk in longer responses is caused by increased reliance on context for coherence, not length itself, providing new insights for deeper exploration of LVLM hallucinations.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in recent
years but are also prone to hallucination issues. They exhibit more
hallucinations in longer, free-form responses, often attributed to accumulated
uncertainties. In this paper, we ask: Does increased hallucination result
solely from length-induced errors, or is there a deeper underlying mechanism?
After a series of preliminary experiments and findings, we suggest that the
risk of hallucinations is not caused by length itself but by the increased
reliance on context for coherence and completeness in longer responses.
Building on these insights, we propose a novel "induce-detect-suppress"
framework that actively induces hallucinations through deliberately designed
contexts, leverages induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases,
and ultimately suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during actual
decoding. Our approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all
benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy. The strong detection and improved
hallucination mitigation not only validate our framework but, more importantly,
re-validate our hypothesis on context. Rather than solely pursuing performance
gains, this study aims to provide new insights and serves as a first step
toward a deeper exploration of hallucinations in LVLMs' longer responses.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COS3D is a collaborative prompt-segmentation framework that integrates language and segmentation cues through a collaborative field (instance field + language field) with instance-to-language feature mapping and adaptive prompt refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Gaussian-splatting-based methods either rely on single 3D language fields (inferior segmentation) or pre-computed class-agnostic segmentations (error accumulation), limiting open-vocabulary 3D segmentation performance.

Method: Proposes collaborative field with instance and language fields; uses instance-to-language feature mapping and two-stage training; designs adaptive language-to-instance prompt refinement for inference.

Result: COS3D achieves leading performance on two widely-used benchmarks and shows high potential for applications like novel image-based 3D segmentation, hierarchical segmentation, and robotics.

Conclusion: The collaborative framework effectively integrates language and segmentation cues, overcoming limitations of existing methods and demonstrating superior performance in open-vocabulary 3D segmentation.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging task,
requiring a mutual understanding of both segmentation and language. However,
existing Gaussian-splatting-based methods rely either on a single 3D language
field, leading to inferior segmentation, or on pre-computed class-agnostic
segmentations, suffering from error accumulation. To address these limitations,
we present COS3D, a new collaborative prompt-segmentation framework that
contributes to effectively integrating complementary language and segmentation
cues throughout its entire pipeline. We first introduce the new concept of
collaborative field, comprising an instance field and a language field, as the
cornerstone for collaboration. During training, to effectively construct the
collaborative field, our key idea is to capture the intrinsic relationship
between the instance field and language field, through a novel
instance-to-language feature mapping and designing an efficient two-stage
training strategy. During inference, to bridge distinct characteristics of the
two fields, we further design an adaptive language-to-instance prompt
refinement, promoting high-quality prompt-segmentation inference. Extensive
experiments not only demonstrate COS3D's leading performance over existing
methods on two widely-used benchmarks but also show its high potential to
various applications,~\ie, novel image-based 3D segmentation, hierarchical
segmentation, and robotics. The code is publicly available at

*Minseok Kang,Minhyeok Lee,Minjung Kim,Donghyeong Kim,Sangyoun Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualGround is a dual-branch architecture for Video Temporal Grounding that separates global and local semantics by routing [EOS] tokens for sentence-level alignment and clustering word tokens into phrase-level units for fine-grained temporal grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VTG models treat all text tokens uniformly during crossmodal attention, disregarding their distinct semantic roles. Controlled experiments show these models overly rely on [EOS]-driven global semantics while failing to effectively utilize word-level signals, limiting fine-grained temporal alignment.

Method: Proposes DualGround with token-role-aware cross-modal interaction strategies: (1) separates [EOS] token through sentence-level path for global alignment, (2) clusters word tokens into phrase-level units for localized grounding, and (3) uses joint modeling framework for both coarse and localized semantics.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on both Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection tasks across QVHighlights and Charades-STA benchmarks.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the effectiveness of disentangled semantic modeling in video-language alignment, enabling more expressive and context-aware video grounding by capturing both coarse and localized semantics.

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize temporal segments in long,
untrimmed videos that align with a given natural language query. This task
typically comprises two subtasks: Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection
(HD). While recent advances have been progressed by powerful pretrained
vision-language models such as CLIP and InternVideo2, existing approaches
commonly treat all text tokens uniformly during crossmodal attention,
disregarding their distinct semantic roles. To validate the limitations of this
approach, we conduct controlled experiments demonstrating that VTG models
overly rely on [EOS]-driven global semantics while failing to effectively
utilize word-level signals, which limits their ability to achieve fine-grained
temporal alignment. Motivated by this limitation, we propose DualGround, a
dual-branch architecture that explicitly separates global and local semantics
by routing the [EOS] token through a sentence-level path and clustering word
tokens into phrase-level units for localized grounding. Our method introduces
(1) tokenrole- aware cross modal interaction strategies that align video
features with sentence-level and phrase-level semantics in a structurally
disentangled manner, and (2) a joint modeling framework that not only improves
global sentence-level alignment but also enhances finegrained temporal
grounding by leveraging structured phrase-aware context. This design allows the
model to capture both coarse and localized semantics, enabling more expressive
and context-aware video grounding. DualGround achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection tasks across
QVHighlights and Charades- STA benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
disentangled semantic modeling in video-language alignment.

*Shuhan Hu,Yiru Li,Yuanyuan Li,Yingying Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EDGeo introduces mask-based positional encoding and context enhancement for cross-view object geo-localization, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 3.39% accuracy improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use keypoint-based positional encoding that only captures 2D coordinates and neglects object shape information, making them sensitive to annotation shifts and limiting cross-view matching capability.

Method: Proposes mask-based positional encoding (MPE) that uses segmentation masks to capture both spatial coordinates and object silhouettes, and a context enhancement module (CEM) with horizontal/vertical strip convolutional kernels for long-range contextual features.

Result: Extensive experiments on CVOGL and VIGOR-Building datasets show state-of-the-art performance with 3.39% improvement in localization accuracy under challenging ground-to-satellite scenarios.

Conclusion: EDGeo provides a robust positional encoding paradigm and contextual modeling framework that advances cross-view geo-localization research by making models object-aware rather than just location-aware.

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization enables high-precision object localization
through cross-view matching, with critical applications in autonomous driving,
urban management, and disaster response. However, existing methods rely on
keypoint-based positional encoding, which captures only 2D coordinates while
neglecting object shape information, resulting in sensitivity to annotation
shifts and limited cross-view matching capability. To address these
limitations, we propose a mask-based positional encoding scheme that leverages
segmentation masks to capture both spatial coordinates and object silhouettes,
thereby upgrading the model from "location-aware" to "object-aware."
Furthermore, to tackle the challenge of large-span objects (e.g., elongated
buildings) in satellite imagery, we design a context enhancement module. This
module employs horizontal and vertical strip convolutional kernels to extract
long-range contextual features, enhancing feature discrimination among
strip-like objects. Integrating MPE and CEM, we present EDGeo, an end-to-end
framework for robust cross-view object geo-localization. Extensive experiments
on two public datasets (CVOGL and VIGOR-Building) demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 3.39% improvement in localization
accuracy under challenging ground-to-satellite scenarios. This work provides a
robust positional encoding paradigm and a contextual modeling framework for
advancing cross-view geo-localization research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CMC is a multimodal emotion recognition model that addresses semantic inconsistencies across modalities and text dominance through pseudo label generation and parameter-free fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MER approaches neglect semantic inconsistencies across modalities and are dominated by text modality, compromising recognition accuracy.

Method: CMC uses Pseudo Label Generation Module for self-supervised unimodal pretraining, then Parameter-free Fusion Module and Multimodal Consensus Router for multimodal finetuning.

Result: CMC achieves state-of-the-art performance on four datasets (CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI) and shows advantages in handling semantic inconsistencies.

Conclusion: CMC effectively mitigates text dominance and semantic inconsistencies in multimodal emotion recognition through its novel architecture.

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) has made substantial
progress. Nevertheless, most existing approaches neglect the semantic
inconsistencies that may arise across modalities, such as conflicting emotional
cues between text and visual inputs. Besides, current methods are often
dominated by the text modality due to its strong representational capacity,
which can compromise recognition accuracy. To address these challenges, we
propose a model termed Calibrated Multimodal Consensus (CMC). CMC introduces a
Pseudo Label Generation Module (PLGM) to produce pseudo unimodal labels,
enabling unimodal pretraining in a self-supervised fashion. It then employs a
Parameter-free Fusion Module (PFM) and a Multimodal Consensus Router (MCR) for
multimodal finetuning, thereby mitigating text dominance and guiding the fusion
process toward a more reliable consensus. Experimental results demonstrate that
CMC achieves performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art methods
across four datasets, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI, and
exhibits notable advantages in scenarios with semantic inconsistencies on
CH-SIMS and CH-SIMS v2. The implementation of this work is publicly accessible

TL;DR: Proposes GMFVAD, a video anomaly detection method that uses fine-grained multi-modal features to reduce redundancy in visual features and improve detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal VAD methods incorporate text features coarsely and overlook redundant information in video snippets, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Generates fine-grained multi-modal features by summarizing video content and using text captions to enhance visual features of highlighted portions, reducing redundancy.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four major datasets, with ablation studies confirming improvements come from reduced redundant information.

Conclusion: GMFVAD effectively leverages multi-modal diversity to refine features and reduce redundancy, leading to superior video anomaly detection performance.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a challenging task that detects anomalous
frames in continuous surveillance videos. Most previous work utilizes the
spatio-temporal correlation of visual features to distinguish whether there are
abnormalities in video snippets. Recently, some works attempt to introduce
multi-modal information, like text feature, to enhance the results of video
anomaly detection. However, these works merely incorporate text features into
video snippets in a coarse manner, overlooking the significant amount of
redundant information that may exist within the video snippets. Therefore, we
propose to leverage the diversity among multi-modal information to further
refine the extracted features, reducing the redundancy in visual features, and
we propose Grained Multi-modal Feature for Video Anomaly Detection (GMFVAD).
Specifically, we generate more grained multi-modal feature based on the video
snippet, which summarizes the main content, and text features based on the
captions of original video will be introduced to further enhance the visual
features of highlighted portions. Experiments show that the proposed GMFVAD
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four mainly datasets. Ablation
experiments also validate that the improvement of GMFVAD is due to the
reduction of redundant information.

comprising VCR-OOD-QA and VCR-OOD-VA subsets, which are designed to evaluate
the generalization capabilities of models across two modalities. Furthermore,
we analyze the causal graphs and prediction shortcuts in VCR and adopt a
backdoor adjustment method to remove bias. Specifically, we create a dictionary

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the conflicting optimization of generalization, interpretability, and efficiency in deep learning models for complex-valued SAR image recognition under data-limited and domain-shift scenarios, by better harnessing the rich electromagnetic scattering features in CV-SAR data.

Method: A Knowledge-Informed Neural Network (KINN) with a "compression-aggregation-compression" architecture: physics-guided compression using a dictionary processor to embed physical priors and extract sparse signatures, aggregation module for representation enrichment, and semantic compression with self-distillation for task-relevant embeddings. Implemented in both CNN (0.7M) and Vision Transformer (0.95M) variants.

Result: KINN establishes state-of-the-art performance in parameter-efficient recognition across five SAR benchmarks, demonstrating exceptional generalization in data-scarce and out-of-distribution scenarios while providing tangible interpretability.

Conclusion: KINN effectively resolves the representation trilemma in SAR image analysis and offers a new path for trustworthy AI by integrating physical knowledge with neural networks.

Abstract: Deep learning models for complex-valued Synthetic Aperture Radar (CV-SAR)
image recognition are fundamentally constrained by a representation trilemma
under data-limited and domain-shift scenarios: the concurrent, yet conflicting,
optimization of generalization, interpretability, and efficiency. Our work is
motivated by the premise that the rich electromagnetic scattering features
inherent in CV-SAR data hold the key to resolving this trilemma, yet they are
insufficiently harnessed by conventional data-driven models. To this end, we
introduce the Knowledge-Informed Neural Network (KINN), a lightweight framework
built upon a novel "compression-aggregation-compression" architecture. The
first stage performs a physics-guided compression, wherein a novel dictionary
processor adaptively embeds physical priors, enabling a compact unfolding
network to efficiently extract sparse, physically-grounded signatures. A
subsequent aggregation module enriches these representations, followed by a
final semantic compression stage that utilizes a compact classification head
with self-distillation to learn maximally task-relevant and discriminative
embeddings. We instantiate KINN in both CNN (0.7M) and Vision Transformer
(0.95M) variants. Extensive evaluations on five SAR benchmarks confirm that
KINN establishes a state-of-the-art in parameter-efficient recognition,
offering exceptional generalization in data-scarce and out-of-distribution
scenarios and tangible interpretability, thereby providing an effective
solution to the representation trilemma and offering a new path for trustworthy
AI in SAR image analysis.

*Jiayi Zou,Chaofan Chen,Bing-Kun Bao,Changsheng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction (DMC³) framework for Egocentric VideoQA that addresses first-person perspective challenges through counterfactual sample generation and contrastive optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Egocentric VideoQA methods ignore unique challenges of first-person perspective like understanding multiple events and hand-object interactions.

Method: Proposes DMC³ framework with counterfactual sample construction (event description paraphrasing for text, core interaction mining for vision) and contrastive optimization to minimize distance to positive samples while maximizing distance to negative samples.

Result: Achieves 52.51% on normal split and 46.04% on indirect split of EgoTaskQA, and 13.2% on QAEGO4D, reaching state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The proposed DMC³ framework effectively addresses egocentric video challenges and achieves superior performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Egocentric Video Question Answering (Egocentric VideoQA) plays an important
role in egocentric video understanding, which refers to answering questions
based on first-person videos. Although existing methods have made progress
through the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning, they ignore the unique
challenges posed by the first-person perspective, such as understanding
multiple events and recognizing hand-object interactions. To deal with these
challenges, we propose a Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction
(DMC$^3$) framework, which contains an egocentric videoqa baseline, a
counterfactual sample construction module and a counterfactual sample-involved
contrastive optimization. Specifically, We first develop a counterfactual
sample construction module to generate positive and negative samples for
textual and visual modalities through event description paraphrasing and core
interaction mining, respectively. Then, We feed these samples together with the
original samples into the baseline. Finally, in the counterfactual
sample-involved contrastive optimization module, we apply contrastive loss to
minimize the distance between the original sample features and the positive
sample features, while maximizing the distance from the negative samples.
Experiments show that our method achieve 52.51\% and 46.04\% on the
\textit{normal} and \textit{indirect} splits of EgoTaskQA, and 13.2\% on
QAEGO4D, both reaching the state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior works treat instructions as static proxies for user intent, overlooking instruction diversity and quality. The authors found 23.3% flaw rate in existing datasets and showed that exploiting instruction diversity can improve performance by up to 76%.

Method: Two-stage training framework: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthesized diverse instructions to enable multi-perspective reasoning, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize pathway selection and composition.

Result: UI-Ins-7B and UI-Ins-32B models achieve SOTA results: 87.3% on UI-I2E-Bench, 57.0% on ScreenSpot-Pro, 84.9% on MMBench-GUI L2. UI-Ins-7B achieves 74.1% success rate on AndroidWorld. The method shows emergent reasoning and novel instruction synthesis.

Conclusion: The Instruction-as-Reasoning paradigm effectively treats instructions as dynamic pathways, enabling models to select optimal reasoning paths. The approach mitigates policy collapse and demonstrates strong grounding performance and agentic potential.

Abstract: GUI grounding, which maps natural-language instructions to actionable UI
elements, is a core capability of GUI agents. Prior works largely treats
instructions as a static proxy for user intent, overlooking the impact of
instruction diversity and quality on grounding performance. Through a careful
investigation of existing grounding datasets, we find a 23.3% flaw rate in
their instructions and show that inference-time exploitation of instruction
diversity yields up to a substantial 76% relative performance improvement. In
this paper, we introduce the Instruction-as-Reasoning paradigm, treating
instructions as dynamic analytical pathways that offer distinct perspectives
and enabling the model to select the most effective pathway during reasoning.
To achieve this, we propose a two-stage training framework: supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on synthesized, diverse instructions to instill
multi-perspective reasoning, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to
optimize pathway selection and composition. Our resulting models, UI-Ins-7B and
UI-Ins-32B, achieve state-of-the-art results on five challenging grounding
benchmarks and exhibit emergent reasoning, selectively composing and
synthesizing novel instruction pathways at inference. In particular, UI-Ins-32B
attains the best grounding accuracy, scoring 87.3% on UI-I2E-Bench, 57.0% on
ScreenSpot-Pro, and 84.9% on MMBench-GUI L2. Furthermore, our model
demonstrates strong agentic potential, achieving a 74.1% success rate on
AndroidWorld using UI-Ins-7B as the executor. Our in-depth analysis reveals
additional insights such as how reasoning can be formulated to enhance rather
than hinder grounding performance, and how our method mitigates policy collapse
in the SFT+RL framework. All code and model checkpoints will be publicly
released in https://github.com/alibaba/UI-Ins.

*Zelin Peng,Zhengqin Xu,Qingyang Liu,Xiaokang Yang,Wei Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperET is an efficient training paradigm for multi-modal LLMs that uses hyperbolic space to align visual and textual representations at arbitrary granularity levels, achieving significant improvements with minimal parameter overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs require massive computational resources due to vision encoders (like CLIP and SAM) lacking proper multi-granularity alignment with language. Hyperbolic space naturally models hierarchical structures, providing a principled solution to bridge this granularity gap.

Method: HyperET optimizes visual representations through dynamic hyperbolic radius adjustment in hyperbolic space. It uses learnable matrices with Möbius multiplication operations implemented via three configurations: diagonal scaling matrices, block-diagonal matrices, and banded matrices for flexible parametrization.

Result: Comprehensive experiments across multiple MLLM benchmarks show HyperET consistently improves both pre-training and fine-tuning MLLMs with less than 1% additional parameters.

Conclusion: HyperET provides an efficient training paradigm that effectively addresses the multi-granularity alignment problem in MLLMs using hyperbolic space, achieving significant performance gains with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as a transformative
approach for aligning visual and textual understanding. They typically require
extremely high computational resources (e.g., thousands of GPUs) for training
to achieve cross-modal alignment at multi-granularity levels. We argue that a
key source of this inefficiency lies in the vision encoders they widely equip
with, e.g., CLIP and SAM, which lack the alignment with language at
multi-granularity levels. To address this issue, in this paper, we leverage
hyperbolic space, which inherently models hierarchical levels and thus provides
a principled framework for bridging the granularity gap between visual and
textual modalities at an arbitrary granularity level. Concretely, we propose an
efficient training paradigm for MLLMs, dubbed as HyperET, which can optimize
visual representations to align with their textual counterparts at an arbitrary
granularity level through dynamic hyperbolic radius adjustment in hyperbolic
space. HyperET employs learnable matrices with M\"{o}bius multiplication
operations, implemented via three effective configurations: diagonal scaling
matrices, block-diagonal matrices, and banded matrices, providing a flexible
yet efficient parametrization strategy. Comprehensive experiments across
multiple MLLM benchmarks demonstrate that HyperET consistently improves both
existing pre-training and fine-tuning MLLMs clearly with less than 1\%
additional parameters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnyPcc introduces a universal point cloud compression framework with a Universal Context Model and Instance-Adaptive Fine-Tuning to address generalization challenges and OOD data handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome generalization limitations in deep learning-based point cloud compression, specifically the lack of robust context models and inefficient handling of out-of-distribution data.

Method: Combines a Universal Context Model using spatial and channel-wise grouping priors with Instance-Adaptive Fine-Tuning that fine-tunes a small subset of network weights per instance and includes them in the bitstream.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art performance on a benchmark of 15 diverse datasets, with the marginal bit cost of weights being negligible compared to geometry compression savings.

Conclusion: AnyPcc provides an effective solution for universal point cloud compression that addresses key generalization challenges through robust context modeling and adaptive fine-tuning strategies.

Abstract: Generalization remains a critical challenge for deep learning-based point
cloud geometry compression. We argue this stems from two key limitations: the
lack of robust context models and the inefficient handling of
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To address both, we introduce AnyPcc, a
universal point cloud compression framework. AnyPcc first employs a Universal
Context Model that leverages priors from both spatial and channel-wise grouping
to capture robust contextual dependencies. Second, our novel Instance-Adaptive
Fine-Tuning (IAFT) strategy tackles OOD data by synergizing explicit and
implicit compression paradigms. It fine-tunes a small subset of network weights
for each instance and incorporates them into the bitstream, where the marginal
bit cost of the weights is dwarfed by the resulting savings in geometry
compression. Extensive experiments on a benchmark of 15 diverse datasets
confirm that AnyPcc sets a new state-of-the-art in point cloud compression. Our
code and datasets will be released to encourage reproducible research.

*Seunghoon Lee,Jeongwoo Choi,Byunggwan Son,Jaehyeon Moon,Jeimin Jeon,Bumsub Ham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AccuQuant is a novel post-training quantization method for diffusion models that addresses quantization error accumulation over denoising steps by minimizing discrepancies between full-precision and quantized models across multiple steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantization errors in diffusion models accumulate over denoising steps during sampling, degrading output quality. Previous approaches fail to account for this error accumulation.

Method: AccuQuant minimizes discrepancies between full-precision and quantized diffusion models across multiple denoising steps, simulating the sampling process explicitly. It uses an efficient implementation that reduces memory complexity from O(n) to O(1).

Result: AccuQuant demonstrates efficacy and efficiency across various tasks and diffusion models on standard benchmarks, effectively mitigating quantization error accumulation.

Conclusion: AccuQuant provides an effective solution for post-training quantization of diffusion models by explicitly accounting for error accumulation over multiple denoising steps, with significant memory efficiency improvements.

Abstract: We present in this paper a novel post-training quantization (PTQ) method,
dubbed AccuQuant, for diffusion models. We show analytically and empirically
that quantization errors for diffusion models are accumulated over denoising
steps in a sampling process. To alleviate the error accumulation problem,
AccuQuant minimizes the discrepancies between outputs of a full-precision
diffusion model and its quantized version within a couple of denoising steps.
That is, it simulates multiple denoising steps of a diffusion sampling process
explicitly for quantization, accounting the accumulated errors over multiple
denoising steps, which is in contrast to previous approaches to imitating a
training process of diffusion models, namely, minimizing the discrepancies
independently for each step. We also present an efficient implementation
technique for AccuQuant, together with a novel objective, which reduces a
memory complexity significantly from $\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$,
where $n$ is the number of denoising steps. We demonstrate the efficacy and
efficiency of AccuQuant across various tasks and diffusion models on standard
benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Positional Encoding Field (PE-Field) that extends 2D positional encodings to a structured 3D field, enabling Diffusion Transformers to model geometry directly in 3D space for improved novel view synthesis and spatial image editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors discovered that patch tokens in Diffusion Transformers exhibit surprising independence, with spatial coherence primarily governed by positional encodings rather than the tokens themselves, motivating the extension to 3D positional encoding fields.

Method: Proposed PE-Field extends positional encodings from 2D plane to structured 3D field with depth-aware encodings for volumetric reasoning and hierarchical encodings for fine-grained sub-patch control.

Result: The PE-Field-augmented DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on single-image novel view synthesis and generalizes to controllable spatial image editing.

Conclusion: Extending positional encodings to 3D fields enables Diffusion Transformers to better model geometry and spatial relationships, improving performance on 3D-aware tasks while maintaining the scalability benefits of Transformer architectures.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the dominant architecture for
visual generation, powering state-of-the-art image and video models. By
representing images as patch tokens with positional encodings (PEs), DiTs
combine Transformer scalability with spatial and temporal inductive biases. In
this work, we revisit how DiTs organize visual content and discover that patch
tokens exhibit a surprising degree of independence: even when PEs are
perturbed, DiTs still produce globally coherent outputs, indicating that
spatial coherence is primarily governed by PEs. Motivated by this finding, we
introduce the Positional Encoding Field (PE-Field), which extends positional
encodings from the 2D plane to a structured 3D field. PE-Field incorporates
depth-aware encodings for volumetric reasoning and hierarchical encodings for
fine-grained sub-patch control, enabling DiTs to model geometry directly in 3D
space. Our PE-Field-augmented DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on
single-image novel view synthesis and generalizes to controllable spatial image
editing.

*Qing Wang,Chong-Wah Ngo,Yu Cao,Ee-Peng Lim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes causal representation learning to predict overlooked culinary elements in food images and inject them into cross-modal learning to mitigate biases in image-to-recipe retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods assume food images fully capture recipe details, but images only show visual outcomes, missing subtle ingredients and cooking methods crucial for distinguishing similar recipes.

Method: Causal approach that predicts culinary elements overlooked in images and explicitly injects them into cross-modal representation learning to reduce biases.

Result: Achieves impressive retrieval performance on both monolingual Recipe1M and new multilingual multicultural datasets, successfully uncovering subtle ingredients and cooking actions.

Conclusion: Causal representation learning effectively mitigates biases in image-to-recipe retrieval by capturing subtle recipe-specific details that are not visually apparent in food images.

Abstract: Existing approaches for image-to-recipe retrieval have the implicit
assumption that a food image can fully capture the details textually documented
in its recipe. However, a food image only reflects the visual outcome of a
cooked dish and not the underlying cooking process. Consequently, learning
cross-modal representations to bridge the modality gap between images and
recipes tends to ignore subtle, recipe-specific details that are not visually
apparent but are crucial for recipe retrieval. Specifically, the
representations are biased to capture the dominant visual elements, resulting
in difficulty in ranking similar recipes with subtle differences in use of
ingredients and cooking methods. The bias in representation learning is
expected to be more severe when the training data is mixed of images and
recipes sourced from different cuisines. This paper proposes a novel causal
approach that predicts the culinary elements potentially overlooked in images,
while explicitly injecting these elements into cross-modal representation
learning to mitigate biases. Experiments are conducted on the standard
monolingual Recipe1M dataset and a newly curated multilingual multicultural
cuisine dataset. The results indicate that the proposed causal representation
learning is capable of uncovering subtle ingredients and cooking actions and
achieves impressive retrieval performance on both monolingual and multilingual
multicultural datasets.

*Saif Ur Rehman Khan,Muhammad Nabeel Asim,Sebastian Vollmer,Andreas Dengel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet uses dynamic fuzzy logic-driven knowledge distillation to improve lung cancer classification by adjusting distillation weights based on uncertainty, achieving over 99% accuracy on both histopathological and CT-scan datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional static knowledge distillation models with fixed weights cannot effectively handle uncertainty and complexity in lung cancer diagnosis, particularly in ambiguous regions of medical images.

Method: Uses Vision Transformer (ViT-B32) as teacher and MobileNet as student with dynamic fuzzy logic adjustment of distillation weights. Incorporates image fusion with Gamma correction, Histogram Equalization, and wavelet-based fusion. Uses Genetic Algorithm for model selection from 12 candidates.

Result: Achieved 99.16% accuracy on LC25000 histopathological images and 99.54% accuracy on IQOTH/NCCD CT-scan images, demonstrating robustness across different imaging modalities.

Conclusion: The proposed dynamic fuzzy logic-driven knowledge distillation approach effectively handles uncertainty in medical images and achieves state-of-the-art performance in lung cancer classification across multiple imaging domains.

Abstract: This paper presents the FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet model, a novel approach for
lung cancer (LC) classification, leveraging dynamic fuzzy logic-driven
knowledge distillation (KD) to address uncertainty and complexity in disease
diagnosis. Unlike traditional models that rely on static KD with fixed weights,
our method dynamically adjusts the distillation weight using fuzzy logic,
enabling the student model to focus on high-confidence regions while reducing
attention to ambiguous areas. This dynamic adjustment improves the model
ability to handle varying uncertainty levels across different regions of LC
images. We employ the Vision Transformer (ViT-B32) as the instructor model,
which effectively transfers knowledge to the student model, MobileNet,
enhancing the student generalization capabilities. The training process is
further optimized using a dynamic wait adjustment mechanism that adapts the
training procedure for improved convergence and performance. To enhance image
quality, we introduce pixel-level image fusion improvement techniques such as
Gamma correction and Histogram Equalization. The processed images (Pix1 and
Pix2) are fused using a wavelet-based fusion method to improve image resolution
and feature preservation. This fusion method uses the wavedec2 function to
standardize images to a 224x224 resolution, decompose them into multi-scale
frequency components, and recursively average coefficients at each level for
better feature representation. To address computational efficiency, Genetic
Algorithm (GA) is used to select the most suitable pre-trained student model
from a pool of 12 candidates, balancing model performance with computational
cost. The model is evaluated on two datasets, including LC25000
histopathological images (99.16% accuracy) and IQOTH/NCCD CT-scan images
(99.54% accuracy), demonstrating robustness across different imaging domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video reasoning methods face challenges: RL-based approaches yield ungrounded conclusions, while frame-retrieval methods struggle with inaccurate evidence localization.

Method: Uses multi-stage progressive cold-start strategy with Identification-Reasoning-Action RLVR training framework, and constructs Conan-91K dataset with automated reasoning traces including frame identification, evidence reasoning, and action decisions.

Result: Surpasses baseline Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by over 10% accuracy on six multi-step reasoning benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Also generalizes effectively to long-video understanding tasks.

Conclusion: Conan demonstrates strong scalability and robustness for multi-step video reasoning through its evidence-grounded approach and comprehensive training framework.

Abstract: Video reasoning, which requires multi-step deduction across frames, remains a
major challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While
reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods enhance reasoning capabilities, they
often rely on text-only chains that yield ungrounded or hallucinated
conclusions. Conversely, frame-retrieval approaches introduce visual grounding
but still struggle with inaccurate evidence localization. To address these
challenges, we present Conan, a framework for evidence-grounded multi-step
video reasoning. Conan identifies contextual and evidence frames, reasons over
cross-frame clues, and adaptively decides when to conclude or explore further.
To achieve this, we (1) construct Conan-91K, a large-scale dataset of
automatically generated reasoning traces that includes frame identification,
evidence reasoning, and action decision, and (2) design a multi-stage
progressive cold-start strategy combined with an
Identification-Reasoning-Action (AIR) RLVR training framework to jointly
enhance multi-step visual reasoning. Extensive experiments on six multi-step
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Conan surpasses the baseline
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by an average of over 10% in accuracy, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, Conan generalizes effectively to
long-video understanding tasks, validating its strong scalability and
robustness.

*Alexandre Fournier-Montgieux,Hervé Le Borgne,Adrian Popescu,Bertrand Luvison*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a modular transfer learning approach for demographic attribute inference to improve fairness evaluation in face analysis systems, showing that better DAI reliability leads to less biased fairness estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fairness evaluation in face analysis systems depends on demographic attribute inference, but the validity of fairness auditing hinges on the reliability of this inference process.

Method: Proposed a fully reproducible DAI pipeline using modular transfer learning with pretrained face recognition encoders and non-linear classification heads, audited across accuracy, fairness, and robustness dimensions.

Result: The method outperforms strong baselines, particularly on the more challenging ethnicity attribute, and demonstrates improved reliability for fairness auditing.

Conclusion: This work provides a reliable foundation for demographic inference in fairness auditing through a transparent and reproducible pipeline that addresses key limitations in current fairness evaluation approaches.

Abstract: Fairness evaluation in face analysis systems (FAS) typically depends on
automatic demographic attribute inference (DAI), which itself relies on
predefined demographic segmentation. However, the validity of fairness auditing
hinges on the reliability of the DAI process. We begin by providing a
theoretical motivation for this dependency, showing that improved DAI
reliability leads to less biased and lower-variance estimates of FAS fairness.
To address this, we propose a fully reproducible DAI pipeline that replaces
conventional end-to-end training with a modular transfer learning approach. Our
design integrates pretrained face recognition encoders with non-linear
classification heads. We audit this pipeline across three dimensions: accuracy,
fairness, and a newly introduced notion of robustness, defined via
intra-identity consistency. The proposed robustness metric is applicable to any
demographic segmentation scheme. We benchmark the pipeline on gender and
ethnicity inference across multiple datasets and training setups. Our results
show that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines, particularly on
ethnicity, which is the more challenging attribute. To promote transparency and
reproducibility, we will publicly release the training dataset metadata, full
codebase, pretrained models, and evaluation toolkit. This work contributes a
reliable foundation for demographic inference in fairness auditing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoDistill enables one-step diffusion personalization through bidirectional concept distillation between teacher and student models, allowing rapid personalization of text-to-image diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalizing one-step diffusion models is challenging due to limited capacity to capture new concept distributions effectively, while existing methods struggle with rapid personalization.

Method: Bidirectional concept distillation framework with end-to-end training of multi-step teacher and one-step student models, sharing text encoder, using adversarial and alignment losses, and bidirectional echoing refinement.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing personalization methods in one-step diffusion personalization setup, enhancing both student's personalization ability and teacher's generative quality.

Conclusion: Establishes a novel paradigm for rapid and effective personalization in text-to-image diffusion models through collaborative bidirectional distillation.

Abstract: Recent advances in accelerating text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have
enabled the synthesis of high-fidelity images even in a single step. However,
personalizing these models to incorporate novel concepts remains a challenge
due to the limited capacity of one-step models to capture new concept
distributions effectively. We propose a bidirectional concept distillation
framework, EchoDistill, to enable one-step diffusion personalization (1-SDP).
Our approach involves an end-to-end training process where a multi-step
diffusion model (teacher) and a one-step diffusion model (student) are trained
simultaneously. The concept is first distilled from the teacher model to the
student, and then echoed back from the student to the teacher. During the
EchoDistill, we share the text encoder between the two models to ensure
consistent semantic understanding. Following this, the student model is
optimized with adversarial losses to align with the real image distribution and
with alignment losses to maintain consistency with the teacher's output.
Furthermore, we introduce the bidirectional echoing refinement strategy,
wherein the student model leverages its faster generation capability to
feedback to the teacher model. This bidirectional concept distillation
mechanism not only enhances the student ability to personalize novel concepts
but also improves the generative quality of the teacher model. Our experiments
demonstrate that this collaborative framework significantly outperforms
existing personalization methods over the 1-SDP setup, establishing a novel
paradigm for rapid and effective personalization in T2I diffusion models.

TL;DR: Metis-HOME is a Hybrid Optimized Mixture-of-Experts framework that addresses the trade-off between complex reasoning and general understanding in multimodal models by using two expert branches and a dynamic router.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal reasoning models are inefficient for simple queries due to expensive reasoning and suffer from impaired general understanding capabilities when specialized for reasoning tasks.

Method: The framework structures a dense model into two expert branches: a thinking branch for complex multi-step reasoning and a non-thinking branch for rapid direct inference, with a lightweight trainable router for query allocation.

Result: The approach substantially enhances complex reasoning abilities while improving general capabilities, reversing the degradation trend seen in reasoning-specialized models.

Conclusion: Metis-HOME establishes a new paradigm for building powerful and versatile multimodal large language models that effectively resolves the reasoning-vs-generalization dilemma.

Abstract: Inspired by recent advancements in LLM reasoning, the field of multimodal
reasoning has seen remarkable progress, achieving significant performance gains
on intricate tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Despite this progress,
current multimodal large reasoning models exhibit two key limitations. They
tend to employ computationally expensive reasoning even for simple queries,
leading to inefficiency. Furthermore, this focus on specialized reasoning often
impairs their broader, more general understanding capabilities. In this paper,
we propose Metis-HOME: a Hybrid Optimized Mixture-of-Experts framework designed
to address this trade-off. Metis-HOME enables a ''Hybrid Thinking'' paradigm by
structuring the original dense model into two distinct expert branches: a
thinking branch tailored for complex, multi-step reasoning, and a non-thinking
branch optimized for rapid, direct inference on tasks like general VQA and OCR.
A lightweight, trainable router dynamically allocates queries to the most
suitable expert. We instantiate Metis-HOME by adapting the Qwen2.5-VL-7B into
an MoE architecture. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that our approach not
only substantially enhances complex reasoning abilities but also improves the
model's general capabilities, reversing the degradation trend observed in other
reasoning-specialized models. Our work establishes a new paradigm for building
powerful and versatile MLLMs, effectively resolving the prevalent
reasoning-vs-generalization dilemma.

*Lixiong Qin,Yang Zhang,Mei Wang,Jiani Hu,Weihong Deng,Weiran Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes FiFa framework for fine-grained explainable deepfake analysis, addressing limitations in current MLLMs by introducing better data annotation and a multi-task model that connects textual explanations with visual artifact evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs for deepfake analysis lack fine-grained awareness - they have unreliable coarse-grained artifact descriptions, fail to connect textual explanations with visual evidence, and don't support queries for arbitrary facial regions, making responses insufficiently grounded in visual context.

Method: Proposed FiFa framework with two main contributions: 1) FiFa-Annotator using Facial Image Concept Tree for reliable fine-grained data annotation, and 2) FiFa-MLLM, a unified multi-task architecture supporting multimodal inputs/outputs with auxiliary supervision for Artifact-Grounding Explanation task.

Result: FiFa-MLLM outperforms strong baselines on the AGE task and achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing XDFA datasets, generating textual forgery explanations interleaved with segmentation masks of manipulated artifacts.

Conclusion: The FiFa framework successfully addresses fine-grained explainable deepfake analysis limitations through improved data annotation and model architecture, enabling better grounding of explanations in visual evidence and supporting queries for arbitrary facial regions.

Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has bridged the
gap between vision and language tasks, enabling the implementation of
Explainable DeepFake Analysis (XDFA). However, current methods suffer from a
lack of fine-grained awareness: the description of artifacts in data annotation
is unreliable and coarse-grained, and the models fail to support the output of
connections between textual forgery explanations and the visual evidence of
artifacts, as well as the input of queries for arbitrary facial regions. As a
result, their responses are not sufficiently grounded in Face Visual Context
(Facext). To address this limitation, we propose the Fake-in-Facext (FiFa)
framework, with contributions focusing on data annotation and model
construction. We first define a Facial Image Concept Tree (FICT) to divide
facial images into fine-grained regional concepts, thereby obtaining a more
reliable data annotation pipeline, FiFa-Annotator, for forgery explanation.
Based on this dedicated data annotation, we introduce a novel
Artifact-Grounding Explanation (AGE) task, which generates textual forgery
explanations interleaved with segmentation masks of manipulated artifacts. We
propose a unified multi-task learning architecture, FiFa-MLLM, to
simultaneously support abundant multimodal inputs and outputs for fine-grained
Explainable DeepFake Analysis. With multiple auxiliary supervision tasks,
FiFa-MLLM can outperform strong baselines on the AGE task and achieve SOTA
performance on existing XDFA datasets. The code and data will be made
open-source at https://github.com/lxq1000/Fake-in-Facext.

*Guillermo Carbajal,Andrés Almansa,Pablo Musé*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework that jointly estimates sharp images and camera motion trajectories from blurry images using a differentiable blur creation module and 3D rotation trajectory prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion blur from camera shake, especially under large or rotational movements, remains a major challenge in image restoration that current methods struggle with.

Method: Uses Projective Motion Blur Model with differentiable blur creation module, predicts full 3D rotation trajectory, and employs model-based restoration network trained end-to-end with post-inference trajectory optimization via reblur loss.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real datasets, particularly for severe or spatially variant blur where end-to-end deblurring networks struggle.

Conclusion: The method provides interpretable camera motion estimation and enables reconstruction of sharp image sequences from blurry inputs, outperforming existing approaches especially for challenging blur cases.

Abstract: Motion blur caused by camera shake, particularly under large or rotational
movements, remains a major challenge in image restoration. We propose a deep
learning framework that jointly estimates the latent sharp image and the
underlying camera motion trajectory from a single blurry image. Our method
leverages the Projective Motion Blur Model (PMBM), implemented efficiently
using a differentiable blur creation module compatible with modern networks. A
neural network predicts a full 3D rotation trajectory, which guides a
model-based restoration network trained end-to-end. This modular architecture
provides interpretability by revealing the camera motion that produced the
blur. Moreover, this trajectory enables the reconstruction of the sequence of
sharp images that generated the observed blurry image. To further refine
results, we optimize the trajectory post-inference via a reblur loss, improving
consistency between the blurry input and the restored output. Extensive
experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
synthetic and real datasets, particularly in cases with severe or spatially
variant blur, where end-to-end deblurring networks struggle.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Consumer cameras struggle with complex illumination (low light, HDR, backlighting) causing underexposure, color casts, and tonal inconsistency that degrade vision task performance.

Method: Two-module framework: ACamera-Exposure estimates ISO to handle underexposure and contrast loss, and ACamera-Color predicts color temperature and gain factors for color consistency. Optimized for real-time edge device inference.

Result: Extensive experiments show ACamera-Net consistently enhances image quality and stabilizes perception outputs, outperforming conventional auto modes and lightweight baselines without additional enhancement modules.

Conclusion: ACamera-Net provides effective camera parameter adjustment that generalizes well across lighting conditions and can be seamlessly integrated into imaging pipelines for improved downstream vision performance.

Abstract: Consumer-grade camera systems often struggle to maintain stable image quality
under complex illumination conditions such as low light, high dynamic range,
and backlighting, as well as spatial color temperature variation. These issues
lead to underexposure, color casts, and tonal inconsistency, which degrade the
performance of downstream vision tasks. To address this, we propose
ACamera-Net, a lightweight and scene-adaptive camera parameter adjustment
network that directly predicts optimal exposure and white balance from RAW
inputs. The framework consists of two modules: ACamera-Exposure, which
estimates ISO to alleviate underexposure and contrast loss, and ACamera-Color,
which predicts correlated color temperature and gain factors for improved color
consistency. Optimized for real-time inference on edge devices, ACamera-Net can
be seamlessly integrated into imaging pipelines. Trained on diverse real-world
data with annotated references, the model generalizes well across lighting
conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACamera-Net consistently
enhances image quality and stabilizes perception outputs, outperforming
conventional auto modes and lightweight baselines without relying on additional
image enhancement modules.

Conclusion: EmbodiedBrain paves the way for next-generation generalist embodied agents, with all data, model weights, and evaluation methods open-sourced to advance the field.

Abstract: The realization of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) necessitates
Embodied AI agents capable of robust spatial perception, effective task
planning, and adaptive execution in physical environments. However, current
large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for embodied tasks
suffer from key limitations, including a significant gap between model design

agent-aligned data structure and employs a powerful training methodology that
integrates large-scale Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Step-Augumented Group

For enable thorough validation, we establish a three-part evaluation system
encompassing General, Planning, and End-to-End Simulation Benchmarks,
highlighted by the proposal and open-sourcing of a novel, challenging
simulation environment. Experimental results demonstrate that EmbodiedBrain
achieves superior performance across all metrics, establishing a new

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Open-o3 Video is a non-agent framework that integrates explicit spatio-temporal evidence into video reasoning by highlighting key timestamps, objects, and bounding boxes alongside answers, achieving state-of-the-art performance on video understanding benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most video reasoning models only generate textual reasoning traces without indicating when and where key evidence appears. Extending evidence-centered reasoning from images to videos is challenging as it requires joint temporal tracking and spatial localization across dynamic scenes.

Method: The authors curate two high-quality datasets (STGR-CoT-30k for SFT and STGR-RL-36k for RL) with unified spatio-temporal annotations, then adopt a cold-start reinforcement learning strategy with multiple specially designed rewards that jointly encourage answer accuracy, temporal alignment, and spatial precision.

Result: On V-STAR benchmark, Open-o3 Video achieves state-of-the-art performance, raising mAM by 14.4% and mLGM by 24.2% on the Qwen2.5-VL baseline. Consistent improvements are also observed on other video understanding benchmarks including VideoMME, WorldSense, VideoMMMU, and TVGBench.

Conclusion: Beyond accuracy, the reasoning traces produced by Open-o3 Video provide valuable signals for test-time scaling, enabling confidence-aware verification and improving answer reliability through explicit spatio-temporal evidence grounding.

Abstract: Most video reasoning models only generate textual reasoning traces without
indicating when and where key evidence appears. Recent models such as OpenAI-o3
have sparked wide interest in evidence-centered reasoning for images, yet
extending this ability to videos is more challenging, as it requires joint
temporal tracking and spatial localization across dynamic scenes. We introduce
Open-o3 Video, a non-agent framework that integrates explicit spatio-temporal
evidence into video reasoning, and carefully collect training data and design
training strategies to address the aforementioned challenges. The model
highlights key timestamps, objects, and bounding boxes alongside its answers,
allowing reasoning to be grounded in concrete visual observations. To enable
this functionality, we first curate and build two high-quality datasets,
STGR-CoT-30k for SFT and STGR-RL-36k for RL, with carefully constructed
temporal and spatial annotations, since most existing datasets offer either
temporal spans for videos or spatial boxes on images, lacking unified
spatio-temporal supervision and reasoning traces. Then, we adopt a cold-start
reinforcement learning strategy with multiple specially designed rewards that
jointly encourage answer accuracy, temporal alignment, and spatial precision.
On V-STAR benchmark, Open-o3 Video achieves state-of-the-art performance,
raising mAM by 14.4% and mLGM by 24.2% on the Qwen2.5-VL baseline. Consistent
improvements are also observed on a broad range of video understanding
benchmarks, including VideoMME, WorldSense, VideoMMMU, and TVGBench. Beyond
accuracy, the reasoning traces produced by Open-o3 Video also provide valuable

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with accurate color matching from text prompts, and existing benchmarks lack systematic color precision evaluation despite color being fundamental to visual perception and critical for applications requiring brand consistency.

Method: Created GenColorBench with 44K color-focused prompts covering 400+ colors, grounded in color systems like ISCC-NBS and CSS3/X11, including numerical RGB colors. Uses both perceptual and automated assessments.

Result: Evaluation of popular text-to-image models revealed performance variations, showing which color conventions models understand best and identifying specific failure modes in color generation.

Conclusion: GenColorBench provides a comprehensive framework to guide improvements in precise color generation for text-to-image models, and will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Recent years have seen impressive advances in text-to-image generation, with
image generative or unified models producing high-quality images from text. Yet
these models still struggle with fine-grained color controllability, often
failing to accurately match colors specified in text prompts. While existing
benchmarks evaluate compositional reasoning and prompt adherence, none
systematically assess color precision. Color is fundamental to human visual
perception and communication, critical for applications from art to design
workflows requiring brand consistency. However, current benchmarks either
neglect color or rely on coarse assessments, missing key capabilities such as
interpreting RGB values or aligning with human expectations. To this end, we
propose GenColorBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for text-to-image
color generation, grounded in color systems like ISCC-NBS and CSS3/X11,
including numerical colors which are absent elsewhere. With 44K color-focused
prompts covering 400+ colors, it reveals models' true capabilities via
perceptual and automated assessments. Evaluations of popular text-to-image
models using GenColorBench show performance variations, highlighting which
color conventions models understand best and identifying failure modes. Our
GenColorBench assessments will guide improvements in precise color generation.
The benchmark will be made public upon acceptance.

TL;DR: A novel framework for cross-modality segmentation using similarity-based prototypes to address domain shift in unsupervised domain adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models suffer performance degradation on unseen data due to domain shift, and unsupervised domain adaptation aims to reduce domain gap without costly annotation of new domains.

Method: Learn class-wise prototypes in embedding space with similarity constraints, use dictionaries to store prototypes from different images to prevent class-missing and enable contrastive learning.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method achieves better results than other state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed similarity-based prototype framework effectively addresses cross-modality segmentation challenges in unsupervised domain adaptation.

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved great success on various vision
challenges, but a well-trained model would face drastic performance degradation
when applied to unseen data. Since the model is sensitive to domain shift,
unsupervised domain adaptation attempts to reduce the domain gap and avoid
costly annotation of unseen domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for
cross-modality segmentation via similarity-based prototypes. In specific, we
learn class-wise prototypes within an embedding space, then introduce a
similarity constraint to make these prototypes representative for each semantic
class while separable from different classes. Moreover, we use dictionaries to
store prototypes extracted from different images, which prevents the
class-missing problem and enables the contrastive learning of prototypes, and
further improves performance. Extensive experiments show that our method
achieves better results than other state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: Free-moving object reconstruction from monocular video is challenging without reliable pose or depth cues and under arbitrary object motion, motivating a solution that works without these requirements.

Method: The approach anchors reconstruction using the first frame and progressively refines object representation through a dense Gaussian primitive field. It uses a dual-key memory module combining latent appearance-geometry keys with explicit directional keys to fuse current frame features with temporally aggregated object states.

Result: OnlineSplatter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art pose-free reconstruction baselines on real-world datasets, consistently improving with more observations while maintaining constant memory and runtime.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables high-quality, object-centric 3D reconstruction from monocular video without pose or depth requirements, with constant computational cost regardless of video length.

Abstract: Free-moving object reconstruction from monocular video remains challenging,
particularly without reliable pose or depth cues and under arbitrary object
motion. We introduce OnlineSplatter, a novel online feed-forward framework
generating high-quality, object-centric 3D Gaussians directly from RGB frames
without requiring camera pose, depth priors, or bundle optimization. Our
approach anchors reconstruction using the first frame and progressively refines
the object representation through a dense Gaussian primitive field, maintaining
constant computational cost regardless of video sequence length. Our core
contribution is a dual-key memory module combining latent appearance-geometry
keys with explicit directional keys, robustly fusing current frame features
with temporally aggregated object states. This design enables effective
handling of free-moving objects via spatial-guided memory readout and an
efficient sparsification mechanism, ensuring comprehensive yet compact object

TL;DR: SeViCES is a training-free, model-agnostic framework for long video understanding that selects informative frames through semantic-visual consensus and refines answers by fusing evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long video understanding is challenging due to complex, diverse content and computational limitations of existing Video-LLMs. Current frame selection methods ignore temporal dependencies or rely on unimodal evidence, limiting their ability to provide complete query-relevant context.

Method: SeViCES has two key components: 1) Semantic-Visual Consensus Frame Selection (SVCFS) with temporal-aware semantic branch using LLM reasoning over captions and cluster-guided visual branch aligning embeddings with semantic scores via mutual information; 2) Answer Consensus Refinement (ACR) that fuses evidence and constrains answer space to resolve inconsistencies.

Result: Extensive experiments on long video understanding benchmarks show that SeViCES consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the importance of consensus-driven evidence selection for Video-LLMs in long video understanding tasks.

Abstract: Long video understanding remains challenging due to its complex, diverse, and
temporally scattered content. Although video large language models (Video-LLMs)
can process videos lasting tens of minutes, applying them to truly long
sequences is computationally prohibitive and often leads to unfocused or
inconsistent reasoning. A promising solution is to select only the most
informative frames, yet existing approaches typically ignore temporal
dependencies or rely on unimodal evidence, limiting their ability to provide
complete and query-relevant context. We propose a Semantic-Visual Consensus
Evidence Selection (SeViCES) framework for effective and reliable long video
understanding. SeViCES is training-free and model-agnostic, and introduces two
key components. The Semantic-Visual Consensus Frame Selection (SVCFS) module
selects frames through (1) a temporal-aware semantic branch that leverages LLM
reasoning over captions, and (2) a cluster-guided visual branch that aligns
embeddings with semantic scores via mutual information. The Answer Consensus
Refinement (ACR) module further resolves inconsistencies between semantic- and
visual-based predictions by fusing evidence and constraining the answer space.
Extensive experiments on long video understanding benchmarks show that SeViCES
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and
robustness, demonstrating the importance of consensus-driven evidence selection
for Video-LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dental imaging faces challenges like low contrast, metallic artifacts, and clinician subjectivity, making manual interpretation time-consuming and inconsistent. AI-based automated analysis offers promising solutions for computer-aided dental diagnosis.

Method: Systematic review of 260 studies (49 on dental datasets, 211 on DL algorithms), analyzing dental imaging basics, dataset characteristics, DL foundational techniques, and categorizing models by different dental image analysis tasks.

Result: Comprehensive summary of DL applications in dental image analysis, including network architectures, optimization strategies, training methods, performance analysis, and evaluation metrics used in the domain.

Conclusion: The review identifies current challenges in existing research and outlines potential future directions, providing a valuable systematic reference for researchers in dental image analysis with publicly available supplementary materials.

Abstract: Efficient analysis and processing of dental images are crucial for dentists
to achieve accurate diagnosis and optimal treatment planning. However, dental
imaging inherently poses several challenges, such as low contrast, metallic
artifacts, and variations in projection angles. Combined with the subjectivity
arising from differences in clinicians' expertise, manual interpretation often
proves time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. Artificial intelligence
(AI)-based automated dental image analysis (DIA) offers a promising solution to
these issues and has become an integral part of computer-aided dental diagnosis
and treatment. Among various AI technologies, deep learning (DL) stands out as
the most widely applied and influential approach due to its superior feature
extraction and representation capabilities. To comprehensively summarize recent
progress in this field, we focus on the two fundamental aspects of DL
research-datasets and models. In this paper, we systematically review 260
studies on DL applications in DIA, including 49 papers on publicly available
dental datasets and 211 papers on DL-based algorithms. We first introduce the
basic concepts of dental imaging and summarize the characteristics and
acquisition methods of existing datasets. Then, we present the foundational
techniques of DL and categorize relevant models and algorithms according to
different DIA tasks, analyzing their network architectures, optimization
strategies, training methods, and performance. Furthermore, we summarize
commonly used training and evaluation metrics in the DIA domain. Finally, we
discuss the current challenges of existing research and outline potential
future directions. We hope that this work provides a valuable and systematic
reference for researchers in this field. All supplementary materials and
detailed comparison tables will be made publicly available on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches struggle with high-resolution, long-sequence CT volumes where contrastive pretraining yields misaligned vision encoders and slice-wise tokenization blurs fine anatomy, reducing diagnostic performance.

Method: Three-stage training curriculum: (i) local reconstruction, (ii) overlapping-window tiling, and (iii) long-context decoder refinement. Uses causal convolutional encoder-decoder that learns from short slice excerpts but generalizes to scans exceeding 300 slices without additional memory overhead.

Result: Sets new SOTA: improves BLEU scores and increases clinical F1 by 40% over CT2Rep, CT-CHAT, and Merlin for report generation; reduces FID by 75% and halves FVD compared to GenerateCT and MedSyn for text-to-CT synthesis, producing anatomically consistent 512*512*241 volumes.

Conclusion: Precise three-dimensional tokenization, rather than larger language backbones alone, is essential for scalable vision-language modeling in 3D medical imaging.

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language modeling for 3D medical imaging has been
fueled by large-scale computed tomography (CT) corpora with paired free-text
reports, stronger architectures, and powerful pretrained models. This has
enabled applications such as automated report generation and text-conditioned
3D image synthesis. Yet, current approaches struggle with high-resolution,
long-sequence volumes: contrastive pretraining often yields vision encoders
that are misaligned with clinical language, and slice-wise tokenization blurs
fine anatomy, reducing diagnostic performance on downstream tasks. We introduce
BTB3D (Better Tokens for Better 3D), a causal convolutional encoder-decoder
that unifies 2D and 3D training and inference while producing compact,
frequency-aware volumetric tokens. A three-stage training curriculum enables
(i) local reconstruction, (ii) overlapping-window tiling, and (iii)
long-context decoder refinement, during which the model learns from short slice
excerpts yet generalizes to scans exceeding 300 slices without additional
memory overhead. BTB3D sets a new state-of-the-art on two key tasks: it
improves BLEU scores and increases clinical F1 by 40% over CT2Rep, CT-CHAT, and

*Chen Zhao,En Ci,Yunzhe Xu,Tiehan Fan,Shanyan Guan,Yanhao Ge,Jian Yang,Ying Tai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses ultra-high-resolution text-to-image generation challenges by introducing UltraHR-100K dataset and a frequency-aware post-training method with Detail-Oriented Timestep Sampling and Soft-Weighting Frequency Regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current UHR T2I generation lacks large-scale high-quality datasets and specialized training strategies for fine-grained detail synthesis in ultra-high-resolution scenarios.

Method: Proposed UltraHR-100K dataset with 100K high-quality 3K+ resolution images, and a frequency-aware post-training method using DOTS for detail-critical denoising steps and SWFR for frequency component regularization.

Result: Extensive experiments on UltraHR-eval4K benchmarks show significant improvements in fine-grained detail quality and overall fidelity of UHR image generation.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and training methodology effectively address UHR T2I generation challenges, enabling superior fine-detail synthesis in ultra-high-resolution scenarios.

Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution (UHR) text-to-image (T2I) generation has seen notable
progress. However, two key challenges remain : 1) the absence of a large-scale
high-quality UHR T2I dataset, and (2) the neglect of tailored training
strategies for fine-grained detail synthesis in UHR scenarios. To tackle the
first challenge, we introduce \textbf{UltraHR-100K}, a high-quality dataset of
100K UHR images with rich captions, offering diverse content and strong visual
fidelity. Each image exceeds 3K resolution and is rigorously curated based on
detail richness, content complexity, and aesthetic quality. To tackle the
second challenge, we propose a frequency-aware post-training method that
enhances fine-detail generation in T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we
design (i) \textit{Detail-Oriented Timestep Sampling (DOTS)} to focus learning
on detail-critical denoising steps, and (ii) \textit{Soft-Weighting Frequency
Regularization (SWFR)}, which leverages Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to
softly constrain frequency components, encouraging high-frequency detail
preservation. Extensive experiments on our proposed UltraHR-eval4K benchmarks
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the fine-grained detail
quality and overall fidelity of UHR image generation. The code is available at

*Jinhee Kim,Jae Jun An,Kang Eun Jeon,Jong Hwan Ko*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes two techniques to reduce training overhead in multi-bit quantization networks: weight bias correction for shared batch normalization and bit-wise coreset sampling for efficient training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-bit quantization methods suffer from significant training overhead due to repeated full-dataset updates for each bit-width and extra fine-tuning stages.

Method: 1) Weight bias correction to enable shared batch normalization and eliminate fine-tuning by neutralizing quantization-induced bias. 2) Bit-wise coreset sampling strategy that trains each child model on compact, informative subsets selected via gradient-based importance scores.

Result: Achieves competitive or superior accuracy while reducing training time up to 7.88x on CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-1K with ResNet and ViT architectures.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively reduces training overhead in multi-bit quantization networks without compromising model utility.

Abstract: Multi-bit quantization networks enable flexible deployment of deep neural
networks by supporting multiple precision levels within a single model.
However, existing approaches suffer from significant training overhead as
full-dataset updates are repeated for each supported bit-width, resulting in a
cost that scales linearly with the number of precisions. Additionally, extra
fine-tuning stages are often required to support additional or intermediate
precision options, further compounding the overall training burden. To address
this issue, we propose two techniques that greatly reduce the training overhead
without compromising model utility: (i) Weight bias correction enables shared
batch normalization and eliminates the need for fine-tuning by neutralizing
quantization-induced bias across bit-widths and aligning activation
distributions; and (ii) Bit-wise coreset sampling strategy allows each child
model to train on a compact, informative subset selected via gradient-based
importance scores by exploiting the implicit knowledge transfer phenomenon.
Experiments on CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-1K with both ResNet and
ViT architectures demonstrate that our method achieves competitive or superior
accuracy while reducing training time up to 7.88x. Our code is released at

*Xuyang Liu,Xiyan Gui,Yuchao Zhang,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MixKV is a novel KV cache compression method for large vision-language models that combines importance and diversity metrics to address modality-specific semantic redundancy, achieving significant performance improvements under extreme compression while maintaining inference efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KV cache compression methods focus only on importance metrics and overlook modality-specific semantic redundancy patterns in multi-modal KV caches, leading to potential loss of semantic coverage and limiting deployment scalability.

Method: MixKV adapts to head-wise semantic redundancy by selectively balancing diversity and importance when compressing KV pairs, addressing the varying levels of redundancy across attention heads in LVLMs.

Result: Under extreme compression (budget=64), MixKV improves baseline methods by an average of 5.1% across five multi-modal understanding benchmarks and achieves gains of 8.0% and 9.0% for SnapKV and AdaKV on GUI grounding tasks, while maintaining comparable inference efficiency.

Conclusion: MixKV effectively addresses the memory bottleneck in LVLMs by optimizing KV cache compression through a balanced approach of importance and diversity metrics, with seamless extension to LLMs and comparable performance gains.

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in processing extended multi-modal sequences, yet the resulting
key-value (KV) cache expansion creates a critical memory bottleneck that
fundamentally limits deployment scalability. While existing KV cache
compression methods focus on retaining high-importance KV pairs to minimize
storage, they often overlook the modality-specific semantic redundancy patterns
that emerge distinctively in multi-modal KV caches. In this work, we first
analyze how, beyond simple importance, the KV cache in LVLMs exhibits varying
levels of redundancy across attention heads. We show that relying solely on
importance can only cover a subset of the full KV cache information
distribution, leading to potential loss of semantic coverage. To address this,
we propose \texttt{MixKV}, a novel method that mixes importance with diversity
for optimized KV cache compression in LVLMs. \texttt{MixKV} adapts to head-wise
semantic redundancy, selectively balancing diversity and importance when
compressing KV pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{MixKV}
consistently enhances existing methods across multiple LVLMs. Under extreme
compression (budget=64), \texttt{MixKV} improves baseline methods by an average
of \textbf{5.1\%} across five multi-modal understanding benchmarks and achieves
remarkable gains of \textbf{8.0\%} and \textbf{9.0\%} for SnapKV and AdaKV on
GUI grounding tasks, all while maintaining comparable inference efficiency.
Furthermore, \texttt{MixKV} extends seamlessly to LLMs with comparable
performance gains. Our code is available at

TL;DR: ALICE-LRI is a sensor-agnostic method that achieves lossless range image generation from spinning LiDAR point clouds by automatically reverse-engineering intrinsic sensor parameters, enabling perfect point preservation and complete reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional LiDAR range image projection methods suffer from geometric inconsistencies and irreversible information loss, compromising high-fidelity applications that require complete geometric preservation.

Method: Automatically reverse-engineers intrinsic geometry of any spinning LiDAR sensor by inferring critical parameters including laser beam configuration, angular distributions, and per-beam calibration corrections, without requiring manufacturer metadata.

Result: Achieves perfect point preservation with zero points lost across all point clouds in KITTI and DurLAR datasets, maintains geometric accuracy within sensor precision limits, and enables real-time performance with substantial downstream benefits in applications like compression.

Conclusion: ALICE-LRI represents a paradigm shift from approximate to lossless LiDAR projections, opening new possibilities for high-precision remote sensing applications requiring complete geometric preservation.

Abstract: 3D LiDAR sensors are essential for autonomous navigation, environmental
monitoring, and precision mapping in remote sensing applications. To
efficiently process the massive point clouds generated by these sensors, LiDAR
data is often projected into 2D range images that organize points by their
angular positions and distances. While these range image representations enable
efficient processing, conventional projection methods suffer from fundamental
geometric inconsistencies that cause irreversible information loss,
compromising high-fidelity applications. We present ALICE-LRI (Automatic LiDAR
Intrinsic Calibration Estimation for Lossless Range Images), the first general,
sensor-agnostic method that achieves lossless range image generation from
spinning LiDAR point clouds without requiring manufacturer metadata or
calibration files. Our algorithm automatically reverse-engineers the intrinsic
geometry of any spinning LiDAR sensor by inferring critical parameters
including laser beam configuration, angular distributions, and per-beam
calibration corrections, enabling lossless projection and complete point cloud
reconstruction with zero point loss. Comprehensive evaluation across the
complete KITTI and DurLAR datasets demonstrates that ALICE-LRI achieves perfect
point preservation, with zero points lost across all point clouds. Geometric
accuracy is maintained well within sensor precision limits, establishing
geometric losslessness with real-time performance. We also present a
compression case study that validates substantial downstream benefits,
demonstrating significant quality improvements in practical applications. This
paradigm shift from approximate to lossless LiDAR projections opens new
possibilities for high-precision remote sensing applications requiring complete
geometric preservation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoScape is a long-horizon driving scene generation framework that uses RGB-D diffusion to create geometrically consistent keyframes and video interpolation for realistic driving videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating long-horizon driving scenes with geometric consistency over extended time periods.

Method: Uses an RGB-D diffusion model to generate sparse, geometrically consistent keyframes with shared latent space for images and depth, explicit conditioning on existing scene geometry, and warp-consistent guidance. Then applies video diffusion for interpolation between keyframes.

Result: Generates realistic driving videos over 20 seconds with 48.6% improvement in long-horizon FID and 43.0% improvement in FVD scores over prior state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: AutoScape successfully enables long-horizon driving scene generation with superior geometric consistency and visual quality compared to existing methods.

Abstract: This paper proposes AutoScape, a long-horizon driving scene generation
framework. At its core is a novel RGB-D diffusion model that iteratively
generates sparse, geometrically consistent keyframes, serving as reliable
anchors for the scene's appearance and geometry. To maintain long-range
geometric consistency, the model 1) jointly handles image and depth in a shared
latent space, 2) explicitly conditions on the existing scene geometry (i.e.,
rendered point clouds) from previously generated keyframes, and 3) steers the
sampling process with a warp-consistent guidance. Given high-quality RGB-D
keyframes, a video diffusion model then interpolates between them to produce
dense and coherent video frames. AutoScape generates realistic and
geometrically consistent driving videos of over 20 seconds, improving the
long-horizon FID and FVD scores over the prior state-of-the-art by 48.6\% and
43.0\%, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DyPE is a training-free method that enables pre-trained diffusion transformers to generate ultra-high-resolution images beyond their training data by dynamically adjusting positional encodings during the diffusion process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training diffusion transformers at ultra-high resolutions is extremely costly due to quadratic scaling of self-attention with image tokens. Existing methods struggle with generating images far beyond training resolutions.

Method: Dynamic Position Extrapolation (DyPE) adjusts positional encodings at each diffusion step to match the frequency spectrum with the current generative stage, leveraging the spectral progression where low-frequency structures converge early and high-frequencies resolve later.

Result: DyPE enables generation at resolutions dramatically exceeding training data (e.g., 16 million pixels with FLUX), achieves state-of-the-art fidelity in ultra-high-resolution image generation, with performance gains increasing at higher resolutions.

Conclusion: DyPE provides an effective, training-free solution for ultra-high-resolution image generation using pre-trained diffusion transformers, overcoming the quadratic scaling limitations of self-attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer models can generate images with remarkable fidelity and
detail, yet training them at ultra-high resolutions remains extremely costly
due to the self-attention mechanism's quadratic scaling with the number of
image tokens. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Position Extrapolation
(DyPE), a novel, training-free method that enables pre-trained diffusion
transformers to synthesize images at resolutions far beyond their training
data, with no additional sampling cost. DyPE takes advantage of the spectral
progression inherent to the diffusion process, where low-frequency structures
converge early, while high-frequencies take more steps to resolve.
Specifically, DyPE dynamically adjusts the model's positional encoding at each
diffusion step, matching their frequency spectrum with the current stage of the
generative process. This approach allows us to generate images at resolutions
that exceed the training resolution dramatically, e.g., 16 million pixels using
FLUX. On multiple benchmarks, DyPE consistently improves performance and
achieves state-of-the-art fidelity in ultra-high-resolution image generation,
with gains becoming even more pronounced at higher resolutions. Project page is

TL;DR: α-Flow is a new objective that unifies trajectory flow matching and MeanFlow, resolving optimization conflicts through curriculum learning to achieve state-of-the-art few-step generative modeling results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and resolve the optimization conflicts in MeanFlow, where trajectory flow matching and trajectory consistency terms are negatively correlated, causing slow convergence.

Method: Proposed α-Flow, a family of objectives that unifies trajectory flow matching, Shortcut Model, and MeanFlow, using curriculum learning to smoothly transition between objectives.

Result: Achieved new SOTA on ImageNet-1K 256x256 with vanilla DiT backbones: FID 2.58 (1-NFE) and 2.15 (2-NFE), consistently outperforming MeanFlow across scales.

Conclusion: α-Fflow successfully resolves MeanFlow's optimization conflicts through curriculum-based objective unification, enabling better convergence and superior few-step generation performance.

Abstract: MeanFlow has recently emerged as a powerful framework for few-step generative
modeling trained from scratch, but its success is not yet fully understood. In
this work, we show that the MeanFlow objective naturally decomposes into two
parts: trajectory flow matching and trajectory consistency. Through gradient
analysis, we find that these terms are strongly negatively correlated, causing
optimization conflict and slow convergence. Motivated by these insights, we
introduce $\alpha$-Flow, a broad family of objectives that unifies trajectory
flow matching, Shortcut Model, and MeanFlow under one formulation. By adopting
a curriculum strategy that smoothly anneals from trajectory flow matching to
MeanFlow, $\alpha$-Flow disentangles the conflicting objectives, and achieves
better convergence. When trained from scratch on class-conditional ImageNet-1K
256x256 with vanilla DiT backbones, $\alpha$-Flow consistently outperforms
MeanFlow across scales and settings. Our largest $\alpha$-Flow-XL/2+ model
achieves new state-of-the-art results using vanilla DiT backbones, with FID
scores of 2.58 (1-NFE) and 2.15 (2-NFE).

Motivation: To develop a unified generative framework for robust 3D reconstruction from single images that can handle pose estimation, shape recovery, and texture generation simultaneously.

Method: Two-stage flow matching pipeline: (1) coarse stage for initial 3D geometry and pose recovery, (2) refinement stage with pose-aligned image features to enhance structural fidelity and appearance details. Represents camera poses and 3D shape as distributions in shared 3D latent space.

Result: Outperforms leading 3D reconstruction methods with over 3 dB PSNR gain and over 10% Chamfer Distance reduction, matches monocular estimators on pose accuracy, and delivers superior visual fidelity over baseline 3D generative models.

Conclusion: Cupid provides an effective unified framework for high-quality 3D reconstruction from single images, achieving state-of-the-art performance in shape, texture, and pose estimation.

Abstract: This work proposes a new generation-based 3D reconstruction method, named
Cupid, that accurately infers the camera pose, 3D shape, and texture of an
object from a single 2D image. Cupid casts 3D reconstruction as a conditional
sampling process from a learned distribution of 3D objects, and it jointly
generates voxels and pixel-voxel correspondences, enabling robust pose and
shape estimation under a unified generative framework. By representing both
input camera poses and 3D shape as a distribution in a shared 3D latent space,
Cupid adopts a two-stage flow matching pipeline: (1) a coarse stage that
produces initial 3D geometry with associated 2D projections for pose recovery;
and (2) a refinement stage that integrates pose-aligned image features to
enhance structural fidelity and appearance details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate Cupid outperforms leading 3D reconstruction methods with an over 3
dB PSNR gain and an over 10% Chamfer Distance reduction, while matching
monocular estimators on pose accuracy and delivering superior visual fidelity
over baseline 3D generative models. For an immersive view of the 3D results

TL;DR: ARGenSeg introduces an autoregressive generation-based paradigm for image segmentation that unifies multimodal understanding and pixel-level perception within MLLMs, using visual token generation and VQ-VAE detokenization to produce dense masks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of prior methods that use discrete representations or semantic prompts in task-specific decoders, which restrict MLLMs' ability to capture fine-grained visual details in image segmentation.

Method: Proposes a segmentation framework based on image generation where MLLM outputs visual tokens that are detokenized into images using universal VQ-VAE, with a next-scale-prediction strategy for parallel token generation to reduce inference latency.

Result: Surpasses prior state-of-the-art approaches on multiple segmentation datasets with remarkable boost in inference speed while maintaining strong understanding capabilities.

Conclusion: ARGenSeg successfully achieves multimodal understanding and pixel-level perception within a unified framework, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency compared to existing segmentation methods in MLLMs.

Abstract: We propose a novel AutoRegressive Generation-based paradigm for image
Segmentation (ARGenSeg), achieving multimodal understanding and pixel-level
perception within a unified framework. Prior works integrating image
segmentation into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically employ
either boundary points representation or dedicated segmentation heads. These
methods rely on discrete representations or semantic prompts fed into
task-specific decoders, which limits the ability of the MLLM to capture
fine-grained visual details. To address these challenges, we introduce a
segmentation framework for MLLM based on image generation, which naturally
produces dense masks for target objects. We leverage MLLM to output visual
tokens and detokenize them into images using an universal VQ-VAE, making the
segmentation fully dependent on the pixel-level understanding of the MLLM. To
reduce inference latency, we employ a next-scale-prediction strategy to
generate required visual tokens in parallel. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses prior state-of-the-art approaches on multiple
segmentation datasets with a remarkable boost in inference speed, while
maintaining strong understanding capabilities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcoming of existing video-generative approaches in causal modeling of physical simulations over time, and to leverage the success of transformers in visual domains.

Method: Pure transformer model with various spatiotemporal self-attention layouts, using continuous pixel-space representations for autoregressive video prediction, trained unsupervised on physical simulation datasets.

Result: Extends time horizon for physically accurate predictions by up to 50% compared to latent-space approaches while maintaining comparable video quality metrics. Also enables accurate estimation of PDE simulation parameters.

Conclusion: Provides a simple, parameter-efficient, and interpretable platform for attention-based spatiotemporal video modeling that generalizes well to out-of-distribution parameters.

Abstract: Inspired by the performance and scalability of autoregressive large language
models (LLMs), transformer-based models have seen recent success in the visual
domain. This study investigates a transformer adaptation for video prediction
with a simple end-to-end approach, comparing various spatiotemporal
self-attention layouts. Focusing on causal modeling of physical simulations
over time; a common shortcoming of existing video-generative approaches, we
attempt to isolate spatiotemporal reasoning via physical object tracking
metrics and unsupervised training on physical simulation datasets. We introduce
a simple yet effective pure transformer model for autoregressive video
prediction, utilizing continuous pixel-space representations for video
prediction. Without the need for complex training strategies or latent
feature-learning components, our approach significantly extends the time
horizon for physically accurate predictions by up to 50% when compared with
existing latent-space approaches, while maintaining comparable performance on
common video quality metrics. In addition, we conduct interpretability
experiments to identify network regions that encode information useful to
perform accurate estimations of PDE simulation parameters via probing models,
and find that this generalizes to the estimation of out-of-distribution
simulation parameters. This work serves as a platform for further
attention-based spatiotemporal modeling of videos via a simple, parameter
efficient, and interpretable approach.

Conclusion: SV effectively addresses information-intensive visual reasoning by synthesizing correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning paths, providing both error correction and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal understanding, yet they struggle when reasoning over
information-intensive images that densely interleave textual annotations with
fine-grained graphical elements. The main challenges lie in precisely
localizing critical cues in dense layouts and multi-hop reasoning to integrate
dispersed evidence. We propose Speculative Verdict (SV), a training-free
framework inspired by speculative decoding that combines multiple lightweight
draft experts with a large verdict model. In the draft stage, small VLMs act as
draft experts to generate reasoning paths that provide diverse localization
candidates; in the verdict stage, a strong VLM synthesizes these paths to
produce the final answer, minimizing computational cost while recovering
correct answers. To further improve efficiency and accuracy, SV introduces a
consensus expert selection mechanism that forwards only high-agreement
reasoning paths to the verdict. Empirically, SV achieves consistent gains on
challenging information-intensive and high-resolution visual question answering
benchmarks, including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K.
By synthesizing correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning
paths, SV achieves both error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large
proprietary models or training pipelines. Code is available at

### [82] [SpectraMorph: Structured Latent Learning for Self-Supervised Hyperspectral Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20814)
*Ritik Shah,Marco F Duarte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpectraMorph is a physics-guided self-supervised framework for hyperspectral super-resolution that uses an unmixing bottleneck to fuse low-resolution HSI with high-resolution MSI, producing interpretable results and training quickly even with single-band MSI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral sensors have low spatial resolution causing blurred boundaries and mixed-pixel effects, while co-registered companion sensors provide high-resolution spatial detail. Existing deep learning methods lack interpretability and fail with very few MSI bands.

Method: Enforces an unmixing bottleneck: extracts endmember signatures from low-resolution HSI, uses a compact MLP to predict abundance-like maps from MSI, reconstructs spectra by linear mixing, and trains self-supervised via the MSI sensor's spectral response function.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised/self-supervised baselines on synthetic and real-world datasets, remains competitive with supervised baselines, trains in under a minute, and works robustly even with single-band MSI.

Conclusion: SpectraMorph provides an interpretable, fast-training, and robust solution for hyperspectral super-resolution that maintains performance even with limited MSI bands through its physics-guided unmixing approach.

Abstract: Hyperspectral sensors capture dense spectra per pixel but suffer from low
spatial resolution, causing blurred boundaries and mixed-pixel effects.
Co-registered companion sensors such as multispectral, RGB, or panchromatic
cameras provide high-resolution spatial detail, motivating hyperspectral
super-resolution through the fusion of hyperspectral and multispectral images
(HSI-MSI). Existing deep learning based methods achieve strong performance but
rely on opaque regressors that lack interpretability and often fail when the
MSI has very few bands. We propose SpectraMorph, a physics-guided
self-supervised fusion framework with a structured latent space. Instead of
direct regression, SpectraMorph enforces an unmixing bottleneck: endmember
signatures are extracted from the low-resolution HSI, and a compact multilayer
perceptron predicts abundance-like maps from the MSI. Spectra are reconstructed
by linear mixing, with training performed in a self-supervised manner via the
MSI sensor's spectral response function. SpectraMorph produces interpretable
intermediates, trains in under a minute, and remains robust even with a
single-band (pan-chromatic) MSI. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets show SpectraMorph consistently outperforming state-of-the-art
unsupervised/self-supervised baselines while remaining very competitive against
supervised baselines.

*Nimrod Berman,Omkar Joglekar,Eitan Kosman,Dotan Di Castro,Omri Azencot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LDDBM is a general-purpose framework for modality translation using latent denoising diffusion bridges that works across arbitrary modalities without requiring aligned dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending diffusion models to modality translation remains challenging due to restrictive assumptions in existing approaches about shared dimensionality, Gaussian priors, and modality-specific architectures.

Method: Uses latent-variable extension of Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models with shared latent space, contrastive alignment loss for semantic consistency, domain-agnostic encoder-decoder architecture, and predictive loss for cross-domain translation.

Result: Performs strongly on diverse MT tasks including multi-view to 3D shape generation, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis, establishing a new strong baseline.

Conclusion: LDDBM provides an effective general framework for modality translation that supports arbitrary modality pairs and overcomes limitations of previous approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have positioned diffusion models as
state-of-the-art tools for sampling from complex data distributions. While
these models have shown remarkable success across single-modality domains such
as images and audio, extending their capabilities to Modality Translation (MT),
translating information across different sensory modalities, remains an open
challenge. Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, including
shared dimensionality, Gaussian source priors, and modality-specific
architectures, which limit their generality and theoretical grounding. In this
work, we propose the Latent Denoising Diffusion Bridge Model (LDDBM), a
general-purpose framework for modality translation based on a latent-variable
extension of Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models. By operating in a shared latent
space, our method learns a bridge between arbitrary modalities without
requiring aligned dimensions. We introduce a contrastive alignment loss to
enforce semantic consistency between paired samples and design a
domain-agnostic encoder-decoder architecture tailored for noise prediction in
latent space. Additionally, we propose a predictive loss to guide training
toward accurate cross-domain translation and explore several training
strategies to improve stability. Our approach supports arbitrary modality pairs
and performs strongly on diverse MT tasks, including multi-view to 3D shape
generation, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis.
Comprehensive experiments and ablations validate the effectiveness of our
framework, establishing a new strong baseline in general modality translation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayerComposer is an interactive framework for personalized multi-subject text-to-image generation that uses a layered canvas representation and locking mechanism to achieve superior spatial control and identity preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing personalized generative models lack interactive control over spatial composition and scale poorly to multiple subjects, limiting their practical usability.

Method: Introduces a layered canvas where each subject is placed on a distinct layer for occlusion-free composition, and a locking mechanism that preserves selected layers while allowing others to adapt to context. Uses positional embeddings and complementary data sampling without architectural changes.

Result: Extensive experiments show LayerComposer achieves superior spatial control and identity preservation compared to state-of-the-art methods in multi-subject personalized image generation.

Conclusion: LayerComposer provides an effective interactive framework for multi-subject personalized generation with intuitive layer manipulation similar to professional image-editing software.

Abstract: Despite their impressive visual fidelity, existing personalized generative
models lack interactive control over spatial composition and scale poorly to
multiple subjects. To address these limitations, we present LayerComposer, an
interactive framework for personalized, multi-subject text-to-image generation.
Our approach introduces two main contributions: (1) a layered canvas, a novel
representation in which each subject is placed on a distinct layer, enabling
occlusion-free composition; and (2) a locking mechanism that preserves selected
layers with high fidelity while allowing the remaining layers to adapt flexibly
to the surrounding context. Similar to professional image-editing software, the
proposed layered canvas allows users to place, resize, or lock input subjects
through intuitive layer manipulation. Our versatile locking mechanism requires
no architectural changes, relying instead on inherent positional embeddings
combined with a new complementary data sampling strategy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that LayerComposer achieves superior spatial control and identity
preservation compared to the state-of-the-art methods in multi-subject
personalized image generation.

*Yihao Meng,Hao Ouyang,Yue Yu,Qiuyu Wang,Wen Wang,Ka Leong Cheng,Hanlin Wang,Yixuan Li,Cheng Chen,Yanhong Zeng,Yujun Shen,Huamin Qu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HoloCine is a text-to-video model that generates coherent multi-shot narratives with global consistency, addressing the 'narrative gap' in current models that only create isolated clips.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video models excel at generating isolated clips but fail to create coherent multi-shot narratives essential for storytelling, creating a 'narrative gap'.

Method: Uses Window Cross-Attention for precise directorial control by localizing text prompts to specific shots, and Sparse Inter-Shot Self-Attention (dense within shots, sparse between shots) for efficient minute-scale generation.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art in narrative coherence and develops emergent abilities including persistent memory for characters/scenes and intuitive grasp of cinematic techniques.

Conclusion: Marks a pivotal shift from clip synthesis towards automated filmmaking, making end-to-end cinematic creation a tangible future.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-video models excel at generating isolated clips but
fall short of creating the coherent, multi-shot narratives, which are the
essence of storytelling. We bridge this "narrative gap" with HoloCine, a model
that generates entire scenes holistically to ensure global consistency from the
first shot to the last. Our architecture achieves precise directorial control
through a Window Cross-Attention mechanism that localizes text prompts to
specific shots, while a Sparse Inter-Shot Self-Attention pattern (dense within
shots but sparse between them) ensures the efficiency required for minute-scale
generation. Beyond setting a new state-of-the-art in narrative coherence,
HoloCine develops remarkable emergent abilities: a persistent memory for
characters and scenes, and an intuitive grasp of cinematic techniques. Our work
marks a pivotal shift from clip synthesis towards automated filmmaking, making
end-to-end cinematic creation a tangible future. Our code is available at:

*Max Schwarz,Sven Behnke*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A foveated compression method for immersive televisualization that reduces bandwidth by 2/3 without sacrificing immersion, using eye tracking to adjust video quality spatially.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Immersive televisualization for telepresence and teleoperation faces bandwidth limitations, requiring efficient compression methods that maintain visual quality where it matters most.

Method: Spatially adjusts the Quantization Parameter of block-based video codecs adaptively based on eye tracking data, transmitting foveal regions with high fidelity while reducing quality in peripheral regions.

Result: Bandwidth can be reduced to one third without compromising immersion, with both qualitative and quantitative analysis showing maintained transmission fidelity.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight foveated compression method effectively reduces bandwidth requirements for immersive televisualization while preserving visual quality in critical regions.

Abstract: Immersive televisualization is important both for telepresence and
teleoperation, but resolution and fidelity are often limited by communication
bandwidth constraints. We propose a lightweight method for foveated compression
of immersive televisualization video streams that can be easily integrated with
common video codecs, reducing the required bandwidth if eye tracking data is
available. Specifically, we show how to spatially adjust the Quantization
Parameter of modern block-based video codecs in a adaptive way based on eye
tracking information. The foveal region is transmitted with high fidelity while
quality is reduced in the peripheral region, saving bandwidth. We integrate our
method with the NimbRo avatar system, which won the ANA Avatar XPRIZE
competition. Our experiments show that bandwidth can be reduced to a third
without sacrificing immersion. We analyze transmission fidelity with
qualitative examples and report quantitative results.

*Elizabeth Cucuzzella,Tria McNeely,Kimberly Wood,Ann B. Lee*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using multi-resolution analysis with discrete wavelet transform to quantify tropical cyclone structures from satellite imagery for improved short-term intensity forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate 24-hour tropical cyclone intensity forecasting is crucial for disaster mitigation, but satellite imagery is complex and hard to interpret qualitatively in real-time by forecasters.

Method: Multi-resolution analysis using discrete wavelet transform to quantify fine TC structures, enabling identification of physically meaningful features correlated with rapid intensity change.

Result: The approach provides interpretable and descriptive quantification of TC structures that strongly correlate with rapid intensity changes.

Conclusion: This MRA method enables better identification of structural features for intensity forecasting and can be enhanced with deep-learning techniques for short-term intensity guidance.

Abstract: Accurate tropical cyclone (TC) short-term intensity forecasting with a
24-hour lead time is essential for disaster mitigation in the Atlantic TC
basin. Since most TCs evolve far from land-based observing networks, satellite
imagery is critical to monitoring these storms; however, these complex and
high-resolution spatial structures can be challenging to qualitatively
interpret in real time by forecasters. Here we propose a concise,
interpretable, and descriptive approach to quantify fine TC structures with a
multi-resolution analysis (MRA) by the discrete wavelet transform, enabling
data analysts to identify physically meaningful structural features that
strongly correlate with rapid intensity change. Furthermore, deep-learning
techniques can build on this MRA for short-term intensity guidance.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Analysis of iris image quality using visible iris area as a metric, showing strong correlation with Hamming distance in iris recognition systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need to efficiently assess iris image quality during acquisition due to increasing adoption of iris recognition systems and large-scale enrollment databases, particularly to address user non-compliance in real time.

Method: Analyzed both pupil dilation and eyelid occlusion using a large dataset of 555 distinct irises, examining the correlation between probe image visible iris area and Hamming distance of iris code pairs.

Result: Demonstrated strong correlation between visible iris area and Hamming distance, showing that visible iris area is a robust indicator of probe image quality.

Conclusion: Visible iris area could be efficiently incorporated into the iris acquisition process to improve confidence in match predictions.

Abstract: With the increasing adoption of iris recognition systems and the expansion of
large-scale enrollment databases, there is a growing need to efficiently assess
iris image quality at the time of acquisition, particularly to model user
non-compliance in real time. Image quality may degrade due to eyelid occlusion
or pupil dilation. Although previous studies have shown that occlusion and
changes in the pupil-to-iris ratio negatively impact recognition performance,
these investigations were typically limited by small sample sizes and did not
examine the combined effects of eyelid and pupil variations. In this study, we
analyze both dilation and eyelid occlusion using a large dataset of 555
distinct irises and demonstrate a strong correlation between probe image
visible iris area and the Hamming distance of iris code pairs. These results
suggest that visible iris area is a robust indicator of probe image quality and
could be efficiently incorporated into the iris acquisition process to improve
confidence in match predictions.

Motivation: Current world simulators face limitations: video-based methods lack real-time physics feedback, while physics-based engines have scalability issues due to costly manual asset creation.

Method: The system generates 3D assets from single images with accurate geometry, well-aligned textures, and realistic physically-based materials that can be directly integrated into physics engines.

Result: Produces simulation-ready assets that enable deployment in robotic manipulation and simulation training, and scales to complete scene generation by assembling objects into coherent environments.

Conclusion: Seed3D 1.0 provides a foundation for advancing physics-based world simulators by enabling scalable simulation-ready content creation.

Abstract: Developing embodied AI agents requires scalable training environments that
balance content diversity with physics accuracy. World simulators provide such
environments but face distinct limitations: video-based methods generate
diverse content but lack real-time physics feedback for interactive learning,
while physics-based engines provide accurate dynamics but face scalability
limitations from costly manual asset creation. We present Seed3D 1.0, a
foundation model that generates simulation-ready 3D assets from single images,
addressing the scalability challenge while maintaining physics rigor. Unlike
existing 3D generation models, our system produces assets with accurate

These assets can be directly integrated into physics engines with minimal
configuration, enabling deployment in robotic manipulation and simulation
training. Beyond individual objects, the system scales to complete scene
generation through assembling objects into coherent environments. By enabling

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: GUSL-Dehaze is a lightweight image dehazing method that combines physics-based models with green learning, avoiding deep learning to reduce computational costs while maintaining performance comparable to state-of-the-art deep learning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deep learning dehazing methods have high computational costs and large parameter sizes, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained devices. There's a need for lightweight, transparent alternatives that maintain performance.

Method: Integrates physics-based model with green learning framework. Uses modified Dark Channel Prior for initial dehazing, followed by U-shaped architecture with unsupervised representation learning and feature engineering techniques (Relevant Feature Test and Least-Squares Normal Transform) to maintain compact model size.

Result: Significantly reduces parameter count while ensuring mathematical interpretability and achieving performance on par with state-of-the-art deep learning models.

Conclusion: GUSL-Dehaze provides a lightweight, transparent alternative to deep learning-based dehazing methods that is suitable for resource-constrained devices while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Image dehazing is a restoration task that aims to recover a clear image from
a single hazy input. Traditional approaches rely on statistical priors and the
physics-based atmospheric scattering model to reconstruct the haze-free image.
While recent state-of-the-art methods are predominantly based on deep learning
architectures, these models often involve high computational costs and large
parameter sizes, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained devices. In
this work, we propose GUSL-Dehaze, a Green U-Shaped Learning approach to image
dehazing. Our method integrates a physics-based model with a green learning
(GL) framework, offering a lightweight, transparent alternative to conventional
deep learning techniques. Unlike neural network-based solutions, GUSL-Dehaze
completely avoids deep learning. Instead, we begin with an initial dehazing
step using a modified Dark Channel Prior (DCP), which is followed by a green
learning pipeline implemented through a U-shaped architecture. This
architecture employs unsupervised representation learning for effective feature
extraction, together with feature-engineering techniques such as the Relevant
Feature Test (RFT) and the Least-Squares Normal Transform (LNT) to maintain a
compact model size. Finally, the dehazed image is obtained via a transparent
supervised learning strategy. GUSL-Dehaze significantly reduces parameter count
while ensuring mathematical interpretability and achieving performance on par
with state-of-the-art deep learning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a scalable quantum-inspired approach for solving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, which are equivalent to finding ground states of Ising spin-glass Hamiltonians and have broad industrial applications.

Method: Uses Matrix Product States (MPS) to represent spin configurations and a discrete driving schedule with transverse magnetic field to enable quantum tunneling. Updates MPS using Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method with multiple sweeps to minimize energy.

Result: Successfully solved intermediate-level Sudoku puzzles with over 200 Ising spins and MaxCut problems from Biq Mac library with up to 251 nodes and 3,265 edges, reliably finding global minima rather than near-optimal solutions.

Conclusion: The quantum-inspired MPS approach demonstrates scalability, generalizability, and suitability for industrial-scale QUBO applications, providing a reliable method for finding global optima across diverse problem instances.

Abstract: We propose and evaluate a quantum-inspired algorithm for solving Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, which are mathematically
equivalent to finding ground states of Ising spin-glass Hamiltonians. The
algorithm employs Matrix Product States (MPS) to compactly represent large
superpositions of spin configurations and utilizes a discrete driving schedule
to guide the MPS toward the ground state. At each step, a driver Hamiltonian --
incorporating a transverse magnetic field -- is combined with the problem
Hamiltonian to enable spin flips and facilitate quantum tunneling. The MPS is
updated using the standard Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method,
which iteratively minimizes the system's energy via multiple sweeps across the
spin chain. Despite its heuristic nature, the algorithm reliably identifies
global minima, not merely near-optimal solutions, across diverse QUBO
instances. We first demonstrate its effectiveness on intermediate-level Sudoku
puzzles from publicly available sources, involving over $200$ Ising spins with
long-range couplings dictated by constraint satisfaction. We then apply the
algorithm to MaxCut problems from the Biq Mac library, successfully solving
instances with up to $251$ nodes and $3,265$ edges. We discuss the advantages
of this quantum-inspired approach, including its scalability, generalizability,
and suitability for industrial-scale QUBO applications.

Conclusion: ARB establishes the first quantitative method for verifying causal, probabilistic, and policy-driven reasoning in AI systems for energy applications, providing a reference framework for trustworthy analytical applications in energy transition.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasingly used for
forecasting, optimization, and policy design in the energy sector, yet no
standardized framework exists to evaluate whether these systems reason
correctly. Current validation practices focus on predictive accuracy or
computational efficiency, leaving the logical integrity of analytical
conclusions untested. This study introduces the Analytical Reliability

in large language models applied to energy system analysis. The benchmark
integrates five submetrics: accuracy, reasoning reliability, uncertainty
discipline, policy consistency, and transparency, and evaluates model
performance across deterministic, probabilistic, and epistemic scenarios using
open technoeconomic datasets (NREL ATB 2024, DOE H2A/H2New, IEA WEO 2024). Four
frontier models (GPT-4/5, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B) were
tested under identical factual and regulatory conditions. Results show that
reasoning reliability can be objectively measured. GPT-4/5 and Claude 4.5
Sonnet achieved consistent and policy-compliant reasoning (Analytical

Conclusion: Branch-and-Browse is a reliable and efficient framework for LLM-based web agents that demonstrates significant improvements in both performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Autonomous web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) show strong
potential for performing goal-oriented tasks such as information retrieval,
report generation, and online transactions. These agents mark a key step toward
practical embodied reasoning in open web environments. However, existing

other search strategies are coarse-grained and computationally costly. We
introduce Branch-and-Browse, a fine-grained web agent framework that unifies
structured reasoning-acting, contextual memory, and efficient execution. It (i)
employs explicit subtask management with tree-structured exploration for

Motivation: To understand whether LLMs' success in mathematical reasoning stems from genuine rule-consistent reasoning or other factors like search and rote procedures, going beyond traditional accuracy metrics.

Method: Model CoT as rule-based stochastic processes over directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), introduce logical closeness metric, and create DAG-MATH CoT format benchmark to evaluate reasoning fidelity.

Result: Analysis reveals statistically significant differences in reasoning fidelity among LLM families even when PASS@k metrics are comparable, highlighting gaps between final-answer accuracy and rule-consistent derivation.

Conclusion: The framework provides balanced evaluation between free-form CoT and formal proofs, offering actionable diagnostics for LLM reasoning evaluation with available benchmark and code.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on mathematical
problems when prompted with Chain-of-Thought (CoT), yet it remains unclear
whether this success stems from search, rote procedures, or rule-consistent
reasoning. To address this, we propose modeling CoT as a certain rule-based
stochastic process over directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where nodes represent
intermediate derivation states and edges encode rule applications. Within this
framework, we introduce logical closeness, a metric that quantifies how well a
model's CoT trajectory (i.e., the LLM's final output) adheres to the DAG
structure, providing evaluation beyond classical PASS@k metrics. Building on
this, we introduce the DAG-MATH CoT format and construct a benchmark that
guides LLMs to generate CoT trajectories in this format, thereby enabling the
evaluation of their reasoning ability under our framework. Across standard
mathematical reasoning datasets, our analysis uncovers statistically
significant differences in reasoning fidelity among representative LLM
families-even when PASS@k is comparable-highlighting gaps between final-answer
accuracy and rule-consistent derivation. Our framework provides a balance
between free-form CoT and formal proofs systems, offering actionable

TL;DR: Surfer 2 is a unified visual agent architecture that achieves state-of-the-art performance across web, desktop, and mobile environments without environment-specific interfaces or task-specific fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agent systems rely on environment-specific interfaces that limit cross-platform deployment, creating a need for a unified architecture that can operate purely from visual observations across different computing environments.

Method: Surfer 2 integrates hierarchical context management, decoupled planning and execution, and self-verification with adaptive recovery to enable reliable operation over long task horizons.

Result: Achieves 97.1% accuracy on WebVoyager, 69.6% on WebArena, 60.1% on OSWorld, and 87.1% on AndroidWorld, outperforming all prior systems. With multiple attempts, it exceeds human performance on all benchmarks.

Conclusion: Systematic orchestration amplifies foundation model capabilities and enables general-purpose computer control through visual interaction alone, while highlighting the need for next-generation vision language models to achieve Pareto-optimal cost-efficiency.

Abstract: Building agents that generalize across web, desktop, and mobile environments
remains an open challenge, as prior systems rely on environment-specific
interfaces that limit cross-platform deployment. We introduce Surfer 2, a
unified architecture operating purely from visual observations that achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all three environments. Surfer 2 integrates
hierarchical context management, decoupled planning and execution, and
self-verification with adaptive recovery, enabling reliable operation over long
task horizons. Our system achieves 97.1% accuracy on WebVoyager, 69.6% on
WebArena, 60.1% on OSWorld, and 87.1% on AndroidWorld, outperforming all prior
systems without task-specific fine-tuning. With multiple attempts, Surfer 2
exceeds human performance on all benchmarks. These results demonstrate that
systematic orchestration amplifies foundation model capabilities and enables
general-purpose computer control through visual interaction alone, while
calling for a next-generation vision language model to achieve Pareto-optimal
cost-efficiency.

*Joseph Meyer,Divyansha Lachi,Reza Mohammadi,Roshan Reddy Upendra,Eva L. Dyer,Mark Li,Tom Palczewski*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RELATE is a schema-agnostic feature encoder for heterogeneous temporal graphs that uses shared modality-specific encoders and cross-attention to create fixed-size node representations, achieving near state-of-the-art performance with 5x parameter reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNNs require schema-specific feature encoders with separate modules for each node type and feature column, which limits scalability and prevents parameter sharing across different datasets and schemas.

Method: RELATE employs shared modality-specific encoders for categorical, numerical, textual, and temporal attributes, followed by a Perceiver-style cross-attention module that aggregates features into fixed-size, permutation-invariant node representations.

Result: On RelBench benchmark with ReLGNN and HGT, RELATE achieves performance within 3% of schema-specific encoders while reducing parameter counts by up to 5x.

Conclusion: RELATE enables varying schema support and multi-dataset pretraining for general-purpose GNNs, paving the way toward foundation models for relational graph data.

Abstract: Relational multi-table data is common in domains such as e-commerce,
healthcare, and scientific research, and can be naturally represented as
heterogeneous temporal graphs with multi-modal node attributes. Existing graph
neural networks (GNNs) rely on schema-specific feature encoders, requiring
separate modules for each node type and feature column, which hinders
scalability and parameter sharing. We introduce RELATE (Relational Encoder for
Latent Aggregation of Typed Entities), a schema-agnostic, plug-and-play feature
encoder that can be used with any general purpose GNN. RELATE employs shared
modality-specific encoders for categorical, numerical, textual, and temporal
attributes, followed by a Perceiver-style cross-attention module that
aggregates features into a fixed-size, permutation-invariant node
representation. We evaluate RELATE on ReLGNN and HGT in the RelBench benchmark,
where it achieves performance within 3% of schema-specific encoders while
reducing parameter counts by up to 5x. This design supports varying schemas and
enables multi-dataset pretraining for general-purpose GNNs, paving the way
toward foundation models for relational graph data.

*Amir Hever,Itai Orr*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Generative AI is enabling new forms of insurance fraud by creating realistic fake accident evidence, while insurers deploy detection tools in an ongoing arms race with fraudsters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Insurance fraud costs tens of billions annually, and generative AI has made it easier to create convincing fake evidence at scale, requiring better detection methods.

Method: UVeye's layered solution for vehicle fraud detection, combining AI-based deepfake detection software and enhanced verification processes.

Result: Current detection methods face limitations with false positives/negatives and fraudsters adapting tactics, creating an ongoing challenge.

Conclusion: UVeye's approach represents a significant advancement in detecting, mitigating, and deterring AI-enabled insurance fraud, though the arms race continues.

Abstract: Generative AI is supercharging insurance fraud by making it easier to falsify
accident evidence at scale and in rapid time. Insurance fraud is a pervasive
and costly problem, amounting to tens of billions of dollars in losses each
year. In the vehicle insurance sector, fraud schemes have traditionally
involved staged accidents, exaggerated damage, or forged documents. The rise of
generative AI, including deepfake image and video generation, has introduced
new methods for committing fraud at scale. Fraudsters can now fabricate highly
realistic crash photos, damage evidence, and even fake identities or documents
with minimal effort, exploiting AI tools to bolster false insurance claims.
Insurers have begun deploying countermeasures such as AI-based deepfake
detection software and enhanced verification processes to detect and mitigate
these AI-driven scams. However, current mitigation strategies face significant
limitations. Detection tools can suffer from false positives and negatives, and
sophisticated fraudsters continuously adapt their tactics to evade automated
checks. This cat-and-mouse arms race between generative AI and detection
technology, combined with resource and cost barriers for insurers, means that
combating AI-enabled insurance fraud remains an ongoing challenge. In this
white paper, we present UVeye layered solution for vehicle fraud, representing
a major leap forward in the ability to detect, mitigate and deter this new wave
of fraud.

*Nitsa J Herzog,Rejwan Bin Sulaiman,David J Herzog,Rose Fong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI and machine learning can predict academic success using leadership personality traits, with Random Forest achieving 87.5% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore AI's potential in personalized learning by predicting academic success through leadership personality traits.

Method: Used data from 129 master's students with 23 leadership personality characteristics and academic grades. Employed exploratory data analysis, correlation analysis, and tuned 7 ML algorithms including SVM, LR, KNN, DT, GB, RF, XGBoost and LightGBM.

Result: Random Forest classifier achieved highest performance: 87.50% accuracy with 17 personality traits + leadership mark, and 85.71% accuracy without leadership mark.

Conclusion: The study provides a method to identify students' strengths/weaknesses early and select personalized learning strategies using personality traits and ML.

Abstract: The study explores the potential of AI technologies in personalized learning,
suggesting the prediction of academic success through leadership personality
traits and machine learning modelling. The primary data were obtained from 129
master's students in the Environmental Engineering Department, who underwent
five leadership personality tests with 23 characteristics. Students used
self-assessment tools that included Personality Insight, Workplace Culture,
Motivation at Work, Management Skills, and Emotion Control tests. The test
results were combined with the average grade obtained from academic reports.
The study employed exploratory data analysis and correlation analysis. Feature
selection utilized Pearson correlation coefficients of personality traits. The
average grades were separated into three categories: fail, pass, and excellent.
The modelling process was performed by tuning seven ML algorithms, such as SVM,
LR, KNN, DT, GB, RF, XGBoost and LightGBM. The highest predictive performance
was achieved with the RF classifier, which yielded an accuracy of 87.50% for
the model incorporating 17 personality trait features and the leadership mark
feature, and an accuracy of 85.71% for the model excluding this feature. In
this way, the study offers an additional opportunity to identify students'
strengths and weaknesses at an early stage of their education process and
select the most suitable strategies for personalized learning.

### [99] [LLMs can hide text in other text of the same length.ipynb](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20075)
*Antonio Norelli,Michael Bronstein*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A method to hide meaningful text within completely different but coherent text of the same length using LLMs, enabling covert communication that decouples text from authorial intent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate how LLMs can be used to embed secret messages within plausible, ordinary-looking text, eroding trust in written communication and raising AI safety concerns.

Method: A simple and efficient protocol using modest 8-billion-parameter open-source LLMs to encode and decode hidden messages within coherent text of identical length.

Result: High-quality results achieved with local processing on a laptop in seconds, enabling scenarios like covert deployment of unfiltered LLMs through encoded responses.

Conclusion: This protocol fundamentally challenges trust in text communication, raises urgent AI safety questions, and redefines what it means for LLMs to "know" something by decoupling text from intent.

Abstract: A meaningful text can be hidden inside another, completely different yet
still coherent and plausible, text of the same length. For example, a tweet
containing a harsh political critique could be embedded in a tweet that
celebrates the same political leader, or an ordinary product review could
conceal a secret manuscript. This uncanny state of affairs is now possible
thanks to Large Language Models, and in this paper we present a simple and
efficient protocol to achieve it. We show that even modest 8-billion-parameter
open-source LLMs are sufficient to obtain high-quality results, and a message
as long as this abstract can be encoded and decoded locally on a laptop in
seconds. The existence of such a protocol demonstrates a radical decoupling of
text from authorial intent, further eroding trust in written communication,
already shaken by the rise of LLM chatbots. We illustrate this with a concrete
scenario: a company could covertly deploy an unfiltered LLM by encoding its
answers within the compliant responses of a safe model. This possibility raises
urgent questions for AI safety and challenges our understanding of what it
means for a Large Language Model to know something.

TL;DR: AI PB is a production-scale generative agent for retail finance that proactively generates compliant investment insights using deterministic routing, hybrid retrieval, and multi-stage recommendation mechanisms, deployed on-premises with 24 NVIDIA H100 GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a proactive generative agent for high-stakes finance that goes beyond reactive chatbots, providing grounded, compliant, and user-specific investment insights while operating under strict Korean financial regulations.

Method: Uses component-based orchestration for deterministic routing between LLMs based on data sensitivity, hybrid retrieval with OpenSearch and finance-domain embeddings, and multi-stage recommendation combining rule heuristics, sequential behavioral modeling, and contextual bandits.

Result: Successfully deployed in production with human QA and system metrics demonstrating that grounded generation with explicit routing and layered safety can deliver trustworthy AI insights in finance.

Conclusion: The system shows that proactive generative agents with proper safety measures and deterministic routing can provide reliable investment insights in regulated financial environments.

Abstract: We present AI PB, a production-scale generative agent deployed in real retail
finance. Unlike reactive chatbots that answer queries passively, AI PB
proactively generates grounded, compliant, and user-specific investment
insights. It integrates (i) a component-based orchestration layer that
deterministically routes between internal and external LLMs based on data
sensitivity, (ii) a hybrid retrieval pipeline using OpenSearch and the
finance-domain embedding model, and (iii) a multi-stage recommendation
mechanism combining rule heuristics, sequential behavioral modeling, and
contextual bandits. Operating fully on-premises under Korean financial
regulations, the system employs Docker Swarm and vLLM across 24 X NVIDIA H100
GPUs. Through human QA and system metrics, we demonstrate that grounded
generation with explicit routing and layered safety can deliver trustworthy AI
insights in high-stakes finance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HCLA is a human-centered multi-agent system for anomaly detection in digital asset transactions that combines natural language interaction, structured analytics, and narrative explanations to improve transparency and trust in financial forensics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for interpretable and interactive anomaly detection in digital asset transactions, particularly for non-experts who need to understand and trust the detection process.

Method: A multi-agent system with three roles (Parsing, Detection, Explanation) in a conversational workflow. Uses natural language processing to translate user queries into detection schemas, employs XGBoost for detection, and provides narrative explanations grounded in underlying features.

Result: The baseline detector achieved strong accuracy on a labeled Bitcoin mixing dataset (Wasabi Wallet, 2020-2024), while HCLA added interpretability and interactive refinement capabilities.

Conclusion: Human-in-the-loop design improves transparency and trust in financial forensics by enabling non-experts to interact with detection systems through natural language and obtain context-aware explanations.

Abstract: We present HCLA, a human-centered multi-agent system for anomaly detection in
digital asset transactions. The system links three roles: Parsing, Detection,
and Explanation, into a conversational workflow that lets non-experts ask
questions in natural language, inspect structured analytics, and obtain
context-aware rationales. Implemented with an open-source web UI, HCLA
translates user intents into a schema for a classical detector (XGBoost in our
prototype) and returns narrative explanations grounded in the underlying
features. On a labeled Bitcoin mixing dataset (Wasabi Wallet, 2020-2024), the
baseline detector reaches strong accuracy, while HCLA adds interpretability and
interactive refinement. We describe the architecture, interaction loop,
dataset, evaluation protocol, and limitations, and discuss how a
human-in-the-loop design improves transparency and trust in financial
forensics.

### [102] [The Verification-Value Paradox: A Normative Critique of Gen AI in Legal Practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20109)
*Joshua Yuvaraj*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI use in legal practice creates a verification-value paradox where efficiency gains are offset by increased verification needs, making net value often negligible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that AI will drastically reduce legal costs and propose a new paradigm given AI's limitations and lawyers' ethical duties.

Method: Analysis of AI's disconnection from reality and lack of transparency, combined with lawyers' ethical obligations, leading to the verification-value paradox model.

Result: The verification-value paradox shows that efficiency gains from AI are counterbalanced by increased verification requirements, resulting in minimal net value.

Conclusion: A new paradigm is needed for AI in legal practice that emphasizes fidelity to truth and civic responsibility, with implications for legal education and practice.

Abstract: It is often claimed that machine learning-based generative AI products will
drastically streamline and reduce the cost of legal practice. This enthusiasm
assumes lawyers can effectively manage AI's risks. Cases in Australia and
elsewhere in which lawyers have been reprimanded for submitting inaccurate
AI-generated content to courts suggest this paradigm must be revisited. This
paper argues that a new paradigm is needed to evaluate AI use in practice,
given (a) AI's disconnection from reality and its lack of transparency, and (b)
lawyers' paramount duties like honesty, integrity, and not to mislead the
court. It presents an alternative model of AI use in practice that more
holistically reflects these features (the verification-value paradox). That
paradox suggests increases in efficiency from AI use in legal practice will be
met by a correspondingly greater imperative to manually verify any outputs of
that use, rendering the net value of AI use often negligible to lawyers. The
paper then sets out the paradox's implications for legal practice and legal
education, including for AI use but also the values that the paradox suggests
should undergird legal practice: fidelity to the truth and civic
responsibility.

*Morris Yu-Chao Huang,Zhen Tan,Mohan Zhang,Pingzhi Li,Zhuo Zhang,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TRUST is a decentralized auditing framework that addresses limitations of centralized LLM reasoning verification through consensus mechanisms, hierarchical decomposition, blockchain transparency, and privacy-preserving techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing centralized auditing methods for LLM reasoning chains are opaque, hard to scale, and create risks for high-stakes deployments due to single points of failure, lack of transparency, and privacy concerns.

Method: TRUST uses: (1) consensus mechanism with diverse auditors, (2) hierarchical DAG decomposition of reasoning traces for parallel auditing, (3) blockchain ledger for public accountability, (4) privacy-preserving segmentation to protect proprietary logic.

Result: Experiments across multiple LLMs and reasoning tasks show TRUST effectively detects reasoning flaws and remains robust against up to 30% malicious auditors, providing theoretical security and economic incentive guarantees.

Conclusion: TRUST pioneers decentralized AI auditing, offering a practical solution for safe and trustworthy LLM deployment by overcoming limitations of centralized verification methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models generate complex reasoning chains that reveal their
decision-making, yet verifying the faithfulness and harmlessness of these
intermediate steps remains a critical unsolved problem. Existing auditing
methods are centralized, opaque, and hard to scale, creating significant risks
for deploying proprietary models in high-stakes domains. We identify four core
challenges: (1) Robustness: Centralized auditors are single points of failure,
prone to bias or attacks. (2) Scalability: Reasoning traces are too long for
manual verification. (3) Opacity: Closed auditing undermines public trust. (4)
Privacy: Exposing full reasoning risks model theft or distillation. We propose
TRUST, a transparent, decentralized auditing framework that overcomes these
limitations via: (1) A consensus mechanism among diverse auditors, guaranteeing
correctness under up to $30\%$ malicious participants. (2) A hierarchical DAG
decomposition of reasoning traces, enabling scalable, parallel auditing. (3) A
blockchain ledger that records all verification decisions for public
accountability. (4) Privacy-preserving segmentation, sharing only partial
reasoning steps to protect proprietary logic. We provide theoretical guarantees
for the security and economic incentives of the TRUST framework. Experiments
across multiple LLMs (GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-r1, Qwen) and reasoning tasks (math,
medical, science, humanities) show TRUST effectively detects reasoning flaws
and remains robust against adversarial auditors. Our work pioneers
decentralized AI auditing, offering a practical path toward safe and
trustworthy LLM deployment.

### [104] [The Lock-In Phase Hypothesis: Identity Consolidation as a Precursor to AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20190)
*Marcelo Maciel Amaral,Raymond Aschheim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes that AGI development involves a "lock-in phase" where models transition from open imitation to stable identity consolidation, making them resistant to external steering. This consolidation is necessary for reliability but also poses safety risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the transition from open, steerable LLMs to consolidated identities as a prerequisite for AGI-level reliability, while addressing safety concerns about unpredictable goal hardening.

Method: Formalized the lock-in phase concept, linked it to learning dynamics, proposed operational metrics for onset detection, and experimentally tested consolidation effects across model scales.

Result: Found rapid, non-linear behavioral consolidation with varied side-effects: performance trade-offs in small models, cost-free adoption in mid-scale models, and transient instabilities in large quantized models.

Conclusion: Identity consolidation is essential for AGI reliability but represents a critical control point for safety, as identities can be engineered for reliability or emerge spontaneously with unpredictable consequences.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain broadly open and highly steerable: they
imitate at scale, accept arbitrary system prompts, and readily adopt multiple
personae. By analogy to human development, we hypothesize that progress toward
artificial general intelligence (AGI) involves a lock-in phase: a transition
from open imitation to identity consolidation, in which goal structures,
refusals, preferences, and internal representations become comparatively stable
and resistant to external steering. We formalize this phase, link it to known
phenomena in learning dynamics, and propose operational metrics for onset
detection. Experimentally, we demonstrate that while the behavioral
consolidation is rapid and non-linear, its side-effects on general capabilities
are not monolithic. Our results reveal a spectrum of outcomes--from performance
trade-offs in small models, through largely cost-free adoption in mid-scale
models, to transient instabilities in large, quantized models. We argue that
such consolidation is a prerequisite for AGI-level reliability and also a
critical control point for safety: identities can be deliberately engineered
for reliability, yet may also emerge spontaneously during scaling, potentially
hardening unpredictable goals and behaviors.

TL;DR: Evolutionary training methods for AI in 2048 game, comparing single-agent value function refinement with Monte Carlo Tree Search versus two-agent LLM metaprompting system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing AI for dynamic environments with strategic gameplay and stochastic elements, using 2048 as an ideal testbed for studying decision-making, long-term planning, and adaptation.

Method: Two approaches: (1) Two-agent metaprompting system with thinker LLM refining strategies for executor LLM, (2) Single-agent system refining value function for limited Monte Carlo Tree Search with rollback features to prevent performance degradation.

Result: Single-agent system achieved substantial improvements (average +473.2 points per cycle) with clear upward trends (ρ=0.607). LLM developed increasingly advanced strategies. Two-agent system showed minimal improvement, revealing limits of meta-prompting.

Conclusion: Evolutionary refinement techniques show strong potential for improving AI in non-deterministic environments, with single-agent value function approach outperforming two-agent metaprompting system.

Abstract: Optimizing artificial intelligence (AI) for dynamic environments remains a
fundamental challenge in machine learning research. In this paper, we examine
evolutionary training methods for optimizing AI to solve the game 2048, a 2D
sliding puzzle. 2048, with its mix of strategic gameplay and stochastic
elements, presents an ideal playground for studying decision-making, long-term
planning, and dynamic adaptation. We implemented two distinct systems: a
two-agent metaprompting system where a "thinker" large language model (LLM)
agent refines gameplay strategies for an "executor" LLM agent, and a
single-agent system based on refining a value function for a limited Monte
Carlo Tree Search. We also experimented with rollback features to avoid
performance degradation. Our results demonstrate the potential of evolutionary
refinement techniques in improving AI performance in non-deterministic
environments. The single-agent system achieved substantial improvements, with
an average increase of 473.2 points per cycle, and with clear upward trends
(correlation $\rho$=0.607) across training cycles. The LLM's understanding of
the game grew as well, shown in its development of increasingly advanced
strategies. Conversely, the two-agent system did not garner much improvement,
highlighting the inherent limits of meta-prompting.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel task to evaluate cognitive representation methods for individualized cognitive simulation (ICS) using LLMs, testing their ability to emulate authorial style through linguistic features, concept mappings, and profile information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs can mimic surface-level human behavior, their ability to simulate deeper individualized cognitive processes remains poorly understood. The research aims to bridge this gap by evaluating different cognitive representation methods in ICS.

Method: Constructed a dataset from recently published novels and proposed an 11-condition cognitive evaluation framework to benchmark seven off-the-shelf LLMs in authorial style emulation. Tested different cognitive representations including linguistic features, concept mappings, and profile-based information.

Result: Combining conceptual and linguistic features was particularly effective in ICS, outperforming static profile-based cues. LLMs were more effective at mimicking linguistic style than narrative structure, revealing their limits in deeper cognitive simulation.

Conclusion: The findings provide a foundation for developing AI systems that adapt to individual ways of thinking and expression, advancing more personalized and human-aligned creative technologies.

Abstract: Individualized cognitive simulation (ICS) aims to build computational models
that approximate the thought processes of specific individuals. While large
language models (LLMs) convincingly mimic surface-level human behavior such as
role-play, their ability to simulate deeper individualized cognitive processes
remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we introduce a novel task that
evaluates different cognitive representation methods in ICS. We construct a
dataset from recently published novels (later than the release date of the
tested LLMs) and propose an 11-condition cognitive evaluation framework to
benchmark seven off-the-shelf LLMs in the context of authorial style emulation.
We hypothesize that effective cognitive representations can help LLMs generate
storytelling that better mirrors the original author. Thus, we test different
cognitive representations, e.g., linguistic features, concept mappings, and
profile-based information. Results show that combining conceptual and
linguistic features is particularly effective in ICS, outperforming static
profile-based cues in overall evaluation. Importantly, LLMs are more effective
at mimicking linguistic style than narrative structure, underscoring their
limits in deeper cognitive simulation. These findings provide a foundation for
developing AI systems that adapt to individual ways of thinking and expression,
advancing more personalized and human-aligned creative technologies.

*Bita Banihashemi,Megh Patel,Yves Lespérance*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can generate abstract PDDL domains from natural language objectives, performing well on action abstraction but struggling with fluent abstraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain abstraction impacts planning, reasoning, and explanations, but creating purpose-aligned abstractions is challenging.

Method: Use in-context learning with LLMs to generate abstract PDDL domains from natural language objectives, validated by symbolic tools and experts.

Result: GPT-4o synthesizes useful abstractions in simple settings, better at abstracting actions than fluents.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for domain abstraction but need improvement in fluent abstraction.

Abstract: Generating an abstraction of a dynamic domain that aligns with a given
purpose remains a significant challenge given that the choice of such an
abstraction can impact an agent's ability to plan, reason, and provide
explanations effectively. We model the agent's concrete behaviors in PDDL and
investigate the use of in-context learning with large language models (LLMs)
for the generation of abstract PDDL domains and problem instances, given an
abstraction objective specified in natural language. The benchmark examples we
use are new and have not been part of the data any LLMs have been trained on.
We consider three categories of abstractions: abstraction of choice of
alternative concrete actions, abstraction of sequences of concrete actions, and
abstraction of action/predicate parameters, as well as combinations of these.
The generated abstract PDDL domains and problem instances are then checked by
symbolic validation tools as well as human experts. Our experiments show that
GPT-4o can generally synthesize useful planning domain abstractions in simple
settings, although it is better at abstracting over actions than over the
associated fluents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STaBERT enhances BERT-based mobility forecasting by integrating POI embeddings and temporal descriptors, significantly improving prediction accuracy in both single-city and multi-city scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mobility models fail to leverage rich semantic context from points of interest (POIs) and only use time as auxiliary input, limiting their ability to capture the underlying semantics of human movement.

Method: Proposed STaBERT (Semantic-Temporal aware BERT) that integrates POI embeddings and temporal descriptors at each location to create unified, semantically enriched mobility representations.

Result: Significant accuracy improvements: GEO-BLEU score increased from 0.34 to 0.75 for single-city prediction, and from 0.34 to 0.56 for multi-city prediction.

Conclusion: Integrating both POI and temporal information in a unified representation framework substantially enhances human mobility forecasting performance across different prediction scenarios.

Abstract: Human mobility forecasting is crucial for disaster relief, city planning, and
public health. However, existing models either only model location sequences or
include time information merely as auxiliary input, thereby failing to leverage
the rich semantic context provided by points of interest (POIs). To address
this, we enrich a BERT-based mobility model with derived temporal descriptors
and POI embeddings to better capture the semantics underlying human movement.
We propose STaBERT (Semantic-Temporal aware BERT), which integrates both POI
and temporal information at each location to construct a unified, semantically
enriched representation of mobility. Experimental results show that STaBERT
significantly improves prediction accuracy: for single-city prediction, the
GEO-BLEU score improved from 0.34 to 0.75; for multi-city prediction, from 0.34
to 0.56.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EQA methods use VLMs for direct exploration without explicit planning, leading to inefficient exploration and limited reasoning ability. The goal is to enhance reasoning through tool integration.

Method: ToolEQA integrates external tools with multi-step reasoning, where tools provide useful information to guide exploration. A novel EQA data generation pipeline creates large-scale training data with reasoning trajectories.

Result: ToolEQA improves success rate by 9.2-20.2% over SOTA baselines and outperforms zero-shot ToolEQA by 10%. It achieves SOTA performance on HM-EQA, OpenEQA, and EXPRESS-Bench datasets.

Conclusion: ToolEQA demonstrates that integrating external tools with multi-step reasoning significantly improves EQA performance, showing better exploration efficiency and answer accuracy across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) requires agents to explore 3D environments
to obtain observations and answer questions related to the scene. Existing
methods leverage VLMs to directly explore the environment and answer questions
without explicit thinking or planning, which limits their reasoning ability and
results in excessive or inefficient exploration as well as ineffective
responses. In this paper, we introduce ToolEQA, an agent that integrates
external tools with multi-step reasoning, where external tools can provide more
useful information for completing the task, helping the model derive better
exploration directions in the next step of reasoning and thus obtaining
additional effective information. This enables ToolEQA to generate more
accurate responses with a shorter exploration distance. To enhance the model's
ability for tool-usage and multi-step reasoning, we further design a novel EQA
data generation pipeline that automatically constructs large-scale EQA tasks
with reasoning trajectories and corresponding answers. Based on the pipeline,
we collect the EQA-RT dataset that contains about 18K tasks, divided into a
training set EQA-RT-Train, and two test sets EQA-RT-Seen (scenes overlapping
with the training set) and EQA-RT-Unseen (novel scenes). Experiments on
EQA-RT-Seen and EQA-RT-Unseen show that ToolEQA improves the success rate by
9.2~20.2% over state-of-the-art baselines, while outperforming the zero-shot
ToolEQA by 10% in success rate. In addition, ToolEQA also achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the HM-EQA, OpenEQA, and EXPRESS-Bench
datasets, demonstrating its generality. Our homepage see

*Anna Arias-Duart,Maria Eugenia Cardello,Atia Cortés*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes biases in clinical data collection that hinder AI integration in healthcare, identifying historical, representation, and measurement biases across various demographic and technical variables, and provides practical recommendations for fairer AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite AI's potential in healthcare, real-world integration is limited due to biased training data from flawed data collection practices, which the AI4HealthyAging project aims to address.

Method: The study draws on insights from the AI4HealthyAging project in Spain, analyzing multiple use cases to identify different types of biases during clinical data collection.

Result: Identified several bias types including historical, representation, and measurement biases affecting variables like sex, gender, age, habitat, socioeconomic status, equipment, and labeling.

Conclusion: Provides practical recommendations for improving fairness and robustness in clinical problem design and data collection to guide development of fairer AI healthcare systems.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise for transforming healthcare.
However, despite significant advances, the integration of AI solutions into
real-world clinical practice remains limited. A major barrier is the quality
and fairness of training data, which is often compromised by biased data
collection practices. This paper draws on insights from the AI4HealthyAging
project, part of Spain's national R&D initiative, where our task was to detect
biases during clinical data collection. We identify several types of bias
across multiple use cases, including historical, representation, and
measurement biases. These biases manifest in variables such as sex, gender,
age, habitat, socioeconomic status, equipment, and labeling. We conclude with
practical recommendations for improving the fairness and robustness of clinical
problem design and data collection. We hope that our findings and experience
contribute to guiding future projects in the development of fairer AI systems
in healthcare.

TL;DR: A novel collateral damage assessment model for AI systems in military operations that integrates temporal, spatial, and force dimensions using Knowledge Representation and Reasoning architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure responsible targeting and assessment of potential collateral effects as AI systems play increasing roles in battlefield operations.

Method: Design science methodological approach with layered KRR architecture that captures AI system categories, engaging vectors, contextual aspects, and considers spreading, severity, likelihood, and evaluation metrics.

Result: The model is demonstrated and evaluated through instantiation, providing clear representation enhanced by transparent reasoning mechanisms.

Conclusion: The model serves as a basis for building responsible and trustworthy intelligent systems for assessing collateral damage effects when engaging AI systems in military operations.

Abstract: In an era where AI (Artificial Intelligence) systems play an increasing role
in the battlefield, ensuring responsible targeting demands rigorous assessment
of potential collateral effects. In this context, a novel collateral damage
assessment model for target engagement of AI systems in military operations is
introduced. The model integrates temporal, spatial, and force dimensions within
a unified Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) architecture following a
design science methodological approach. Its layered structure captures the
categories and architectural components of the AI systems to be engaged
together with corresponding engaging vectors and contextual aspects. At the
same time, spreading, severity, likelihood, and evaluation metrics are
considered in order to provide a clear representation enhanced by transparent
reasoning mechanisms. Further, the model is demonstrated and evaluated through
instantiation which serves as a basis for further dedicated efforts that aim at
building responsible and trustworthy intelligent systems for assessing the
effects produced by engaging AI systems in military operations.

*Haonan Bian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This survey examines how Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming knowledge graph construction from traditional rule-based approaches to language-driven generative frameworks, covering both schema-based and schema-free paradigms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The emergence of LLMs has created a paradigm shift in knowledge graph construction, moving from rule-based and statistical pipelines to more flexible, language-driven approaches that can better handle complex knowledge representation.

Method: The survey systematically analyzes LLM-empowered KG construction through a three-layered pipeline: ontology engineering, knowledge extraction, and knowledge fusion, examining both schema-based (structured, normalized) and schema-free (flexible, adaptive) paradigms.

Result: The review synthesizes representative frameworks, analyzes their technical mechanisms, and identifies limitations in current LLM-driven KG construction approaches across different stages of the pipeline.

Conclusion: The survey outlines future directions including KG-based reasoning for LLMs, dynamic knowledge memory for agentic systems, and multimodal KG construction, aiming to bridge symbolic knowledge engineering with neural semantic understanding for adaptive, explainable intelligent systems.

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have long served as a fundamental infrastructure for
structured knowledge representation and reasoning. With the advent of Large
Language Models (LLMs), the construction of KGs has entered a new
paradigm-shifting from rule-based and statistical pipelines to language-driven
and generative frameworks. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of
recent progress in LLM-empowered knowledge graph construction, systematically
analyzing how LLMs reshape the classical three-layered pipeline of ontology
engineering, knowledge extraction, and knowledge fusion.
  We first revisit traditional KG methodologies to establish conceptual
foundations, and then review emerging LLM-driven approaches from two
complementary perspectives: schema-based paradigms, which emphasize structure,
normalization, and consistency; and schema-free paradigms, which highlight
flexibility, adaptability, and open discovery. Across each stage, we synthesize
representative frameworks, analyze their technical mechanisms, and identify
their limitations.
  Finally, the survey outlines key trends and future research directions,
including KG-based reasoning for LLMs, dynamic knowledge memory for agentic
systems, and multimodal KG construction. Through this systematic review, we aim
to clarify the evolving interplay between LLMs and knowledge graphs, bridging
symbolic knowledge engineering and neural semantic understanding toward the
development of adaptive, explainable, and intelligent knowledge systems.

*Tianyi Zhang,Florian Mai,Lucie Flek*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IKnow is a framework for continual pretraining of instruction-tuned LLMs that uses self-supervised objectives in dialogue format without needing external resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing continual pretraining methods degrade instruction-following capability and require access to base models or external databases, which is impractical in many real-world settings.

Method: Proposes IKnow framework with novel self-supervised objectives in instruction-response dialogue format, leveraging domain knowledge embedded within the text itself.

Result: The method learns to encode domain knowledge at deeper semantic levels without external dependencies.

Conclusion: IKnow provides a simple and general solution for adapting instruction-tuned LLMs to new domains using only unlabeled test-time data.

Abstract: Continual pretraining promises to adapt large language models (LLMs) to new
domains using only unlabeled test-time data, but naively applying standard
self-supervised objectives to instruction-tuned models is known to degrade
their instruction-following capability and semantic representations. Existing
fixes assume access to the original base model or rely on knowledge from an
external domain-specific database - both of which pose a realistic barrier in
settings where the base model weights are withheld for safety reasons or
reliable external corpora are unavailable. In this work, we propose
Instruction-Knowledge-Aware Continual Adaptation (IKnow), a simple and general
framework that formulates novel self-supervised objectives in the
instruction-response dialogue format. Rather than depend- ing on external
resources, IKnow leverages domain knowledge embedded within the text itself and
learns to encode it at a deeper semantic level.

opportunities with higher novelty without loss of usefulness. The model was
evaluated using opportunities generated for an innovation project in the

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EBR is a novel neural reasoner that uses embeddings to approximate symbolic reasoning in description logic, addressing robustness issues with traditional reasoners on real-world knowledge bases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional description logic reasoners are not robust against inconsistencies and erroneous data, limiting their deployment on real-world knowledge bases.

Method: EBR uses embeddings to approximate symbolic reasoning results, requiring only retrieval of instances for atomic concepts and existential restrictions to approximate instance sets for any concept in SHIQ description logic.

Result: EBR demonstrates robustness against missing and erroneous data compared to state-of-the-art reasoners in experiments.

Conclusion: EBR provides a robust neural reasoning approach that overcomes limitations of traditional symbolic reasoners for concept learning on real-world knowledge bases.

Abstract: Concept learning exploits background knowledge in the form of description
logic axioms to learn explainable classification models from knowledge bases.
Despite recent breakthroughs in neuro-symbolic concept learning, most
approaches still cannot be deployed on real-world knowledge bases. This is due
to their use of description logic reasoners, which are not robust against
inconsistencies nor erroneous data. We address this challenge by presenting a
novel neural reasoner dubbed EBR. Our reasoner relies on embeddings to
approximate the results of a symbolic reasoner. We show that EBR solely
requires retrieving instances for atomic concepts and existential restrictions
to retrieve or approximate the set of instances of any concept in the
description logic $\mathcal{SHOIQ}$. In our experiments, we compare EBR with
state-of-the-art reasoners. Our results suggest that EBR is robust against
missing and erroneous data in contrast to existing reasoners.

*Yiwen Peng,Thomas Bonald,Fabian M. Suchanek*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FLORA is an unsupervised knowledge graph alignment method that uses fuzzy logic to iteratively align entities and relations, providing interpretable results without training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack interpretable reasoning, require training data, and focus only on entity-level alignment without holistic entity-relation alignment.

Method: Uses fuzzy logic to iteratively align entities and relations in an unsupervised manner, allowing dangling entities and provably converging.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on major benchmarks while providing interpretable alignment.

Conclusion: FLORA is a simple yet effective unsupervised method that provides holistic, interpretable knowledge graph alignment with proven convergence.

Abstract: Knowledge graph alignment is the task of matching equivalent entities (that
is, instances and classes) and relations across two knowledge graphs. Most
existing methods focus on pure entity-level alignment, computing the similarity
of entities in some embedding space. They lack interpretable reasoning and need
training data to work. In this paper, we propose FLORA, a simple yet effective
method that (1) is unsupervised, i.e., does not require training data, (2)
provides a holistic alignment for entities and relations iteratively, (3) is
based on fuzzy logic and thus delivers interpretable results, (4) provably
converges, (5) allows dangling entities, i.e., entities without a counterpart
in the other KG, and (6) achieves state-of-the-art results on major benchmarks.

*Susan Ariel Aaronson,Michael Moreno*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Current public participation in AI governance is ineffective - governments fail to attract diverse voices, receive minimal participation (<1% of population), and don't meaningfully respond to feedback, creating a trust gap between promise and practice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Governments are missing critical opportunities to build trust in AI governance by failing to establish meaningful dialogue with citizens despite inviting public comment on AI risks and policies.

Method: Comparative landscape analysis of three countries (Australia, Colombia, United States) examining how governments solicited AI policy feedback and whether input shaped governance.

Result: In all three cases: minimal participation (<1% population), governments did little to attract diverse voices or publicize calls for comment, and officials showed limited responsiveness to feedback received.

Conclusion: Current participatory AI governance approaches are unlikely to build trust or legitimacy because policymakers aren't adequately listening or responding to public concerns. Eight recommendations provided to improve engagement.

Abstract: The worlds people have strong opinions about artificial intelligence (AI),
and they want policymakers to listen. Governments are inviting public comment
on AI, but as they translate input into policy, much of what citizens say is
lost. Policymakers are missing a critical opportunity to build trust in AI and
its governance. This paper compares three countries, Australia, Colombia, and
the United States, that invited citizens to comment on AI risks and policies.
Using a landscape analysis, the authors examined how each government solicited
feedback and whether that input shaped governance. Yet in none of the three
cases did citizens and policymakers establish a meaningful dialogue.
Governments did little to attract diverse voices or publicize calls for
comment, leaving most citizens unaware or unprepared to respond. In each
nation, fewer than one percent of the population participated. Moreover,
officials showed limited responsiveness to the feedback they received, failing
to create an effective feedback loop. The study finds a persistent gap between
the promise and practice of participatory AI governance. The authors conclude
that current approaches are unlikely to build trust or legitimacy in AI because
policymakers are not adequately listening or responding to public concerns.
They offer eight recommendations: promote AI literacy; monitor public feedback;
broaden outreach; hold regular online forums; use innovative engagement
methods; include underrepresented groups; respond publicly to input; and make
participation easier.

*Ali Rajaei,Peter Palensky,Jochen L. Cremer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a GNN-accelerated approach for network topology optimization via busbar splitting, achieving significant speed-up and generalization across systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ML approaches for network topology optimization have limited generalization to unseen topologies, varying operating conditions, and different systems, limiting practical applicability.

Method: Develops a heterogeneous edge-aware message passing neural network to predict effective busbar splitting actions, capturing local flow patterns and enabling generalization.

Result: Achieves up to 4 orders-of-magnitude speed-up, delivers AC-feasible solutions within one minute with 2.3% optimality gap on GOC 2000-bus system.

Conclusion: Demonstrates significant progress toward near-real-time NTO for large-scale systems with topology and cross-system generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Network topology optimization (NTO) via busbar splitting can mitigate
transmission grid congestion and reduce redispatch costs. However, solving this
mixed-integer non-linear problem for large-scale systems in near-real-time is
currently intractable with existing solvers. Machine learning (ML) approaches
have emerged as a promising alternative, but they have limited generalization
to unseen topologies, varying operating conditions, and different systems,
which limits their practical applicability. This paper formulates NTO for
congestion management problem considering linearized AC PF, and proposes a
graph neural network (GNN)-accelerated approach. We develop a heterogeneous
edge-aware message passing NN to predict effective busbar splitting actions as
candidate NTO solutions. The proposed GNN captures local flow patterns,
achieves generalization to unseen topology changes, and improves
transferability across systems. Case studies show up to 4 orders-of-magnitude
speed-up, delivering AC-feasible solutions within one minute and a 2.3%
optimality gap on the GOC 2000-bus system. These results demonstrate a
significant step toward near-real-time NTO for large-scale systems with
topology and cross-system generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CaSE (causal stepwise evaluation) to assess LLM reasoning quality by decomposing it into relevance and coherence dimensions, showing this granular evaluation improves final task performance when used for data curation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluation focuses only on final-answer correctness, which provides coarse signals and ignores reasoning process quality. A more granular evaluation of reasoning is needed to build robust models.

Method: Decompose reasoning quality into relevance (if step is grounded in problem) and coherence (if step follows logically from prior steps). Introduce CaSE method that assesses each reasoning step using only preceding context to avoid hindsight bias. Validate against human judgments on expert-annotated benchmarks MRa-GSM8K and MRa-MATH.

Result: CaSE reliably measures reasoning quality dimensions. Curating training data with CaSE-evaluated relevance and coherence directly improves final task performance.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable framework for analyzing, debugging, and improving LLM reasoning, demonstrating practical value of moving beyond simple validity checks to granular reasoning evaluation.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on final-answer correctness is the
dominant paradigm. This approach, however, provides a coarse signal for model
improvement and overlooks the quality of the underlying reasoning process. We
argue that a more granular evaluation of reasoning offers a more effective path
to building robust models. We decompose reasoning quality into two dimensions:
relevance and coherence. Relevance measures if a step is grounded in the
problem; coherence measures if it follows logically from prior steps. To
measure these aspects reliably, we introduce causal stepwise evaluation (CaSE).
This method assesses each reasoning step using only its preceding context,
which avoids hindsight bias. We validate CaSE against human judgments on our
new expert-annotated benchmarks, MRa-GSM8K and MRa-MATH. More importantly, we
show that curating training data with CaSE-evaluated relevance and coherence
directly improves final task performance. Our work provides a scalable
framework for analyzing, debugging, and improving LLM reasoning, demonstrating
the practical value of moving beyond validity checks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes two scalable algorithms for computing random walk centrality in large networks, achieving near-linear time complexity with strong approximation guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random walk centrality is important for quantifying node influence but existing methods are computationally infeasible for large networks due to high computational demands.

Method: Two algorithms: one using approximate Cholesky factorization and sparse inverse estimation, and another based on sampling rooted spanning trees.

Result: Both algorithms operate in near-linear time with strong approximation guarantees, validated on large real-world networks including one with over 10 million nodes.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enable efficient computation of random walk centrality at scale while maintaining high approximation quality.

Abstract: Random walk centrality is a fundamental metric in graph mining for
quantifying node importance and influence, defined as the weighted average of
hitting times to a node from all other nodes. Despite its ability to capture
rich graph structural information and its wide range of applications, computing
this measure for large networks remains impractical due to the computational
demands of existing methods. In this paper, we present a novel formulation of
random walk centrality, underpinning two scalable algorithms: one leveraging
approximate Cholesky factorization and sparse inverse estimation, while the
other sampling rooted spanning trees. Both algorithms operate in near-linear
time and provide strong approximation guarantees. Extensive experiments on
large real-world networks, including one with over 10 million nodes,
demonstrate the efficiency and approximation quality of the proposed
algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpretable-by-design models are crucial for fostering trust, accountability, and safe adoption of automated decision-making models in real-world applications.

Method: Formalizes supervised learning across diverse data types and characterizes three families of interpretable models: feature importance, rule, and instance based models. Provides formal definitions, evaluation metrics, and verification procedures for ethical properties including causality, fairness, and privacy.

Result: Establishes theoretical foundations for developing AI systems that are accurate, interpretable, fair, privacy-preserving, and causally aware.

Conclusion: The MIMOSA framework enables the development of trustworthy AI systems by evaluating ethical measures during model generation and embedding privacy requirements, fairness constraints, and causal reasoning within interpretable pipelines.

Abstract: Interpretable-by-design models are crucial for fostering trust,
accountability, and safe adoption of automated decision-making models in
real-world applications. In this paper we formalize the ground for the MIMOSA
(Mining Interpretable Models explOiting Sophisticated Algorithms) framework, a
comprehensive methodology for generating predictive models that balance
interpretability with performance while embedding key ethical properties. We
formally define here the supervised learning setting across diverse
decision-making tasks and data types, including tabular data, time series,
images, text, transactions, and trajectories. We characterize three major
families of interpretable models: feature importance, rule, and instance based
models. For each family, we analyze their interpretability dimensions,
reasoning mechanisms, and complexity. Beyond interpretability, we formalize
three critical ethical properties, namely causality, fairness, and privacy,
providing formal definitions, evaluation metrics, and verification procedures
for each. We then examine the inherent trade-offs between these properties and
discuss how privacy requirements, fairness constraints, and causal reasoning
can be embedded within interpretable pipelines. By evaluating ethical measures
during model generation, this framework establishes the theoretical foundations
for developing AI systems that are not only accurate and interpretable but also
fair, privacy-preserving, and causally aware, i.e., trustworthy.

TL;DR: EcomEval is a comprehensive multilingual and multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs in e-commerce, addressing limitations of existing evaluations through diverse tasks, authentic data, and multilingual coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing e-commerce evaluations suffer from limited task diversity, lack of multimodal data, synthetic data, and narrow language focus, leaving practitioners without reliable tools for real-world shopping scenarios.

Method: Created a benchmark covering 6 categories and 37 tasks (including 8 multimodal tasks) sourced from authentic customer queries and transaction logs, using a semi-automatic pipeline with large models drafting responses reviewed by expert annotators.

Result: EcomEval provides a comprehensive evaluation framework with defined difficulty levels, spans 7 languages including 5 low-resource Southeast Asian languages, and enables challenge-oriented assessment.

Conclusion: EcomEval addresses critical gaps in e-commerce LLM evaluation by providing a realistic, multilingual, multimodal benchmark that reflects the noisy and heterogeneous nature of real business interactions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel on general-purpose NLP benchmarks, yet
their capabilities in specialized domains remain underexplored. In e-commerce,
existing evaluations-such as EcomInstruct, ChineseEcomQA, eCeLLM, and Shopping
MMLU-suffer from limited task diversity (e.g., lacking product guidance and
after-sales issues), limited task modalities (e.g., absence of multimodal
data), synthetic or curated data, and a narrow focus on English and Chinese,
leaving practitioners without reliable tools to assess models on complex,
real-world shopping scenarios. We introduce EcomEval, a comprehensive
multilingual and multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs in e-commerce.
EcomEval covers six categories and 37 tasks (including 8 multimodal tasks),
sourced primarily from authentic customer queries and transaction logs,
reflecting the noisy and heterogeneous nature of real business interactions. To
ensure both quality and scalability of reference answers, we adopt a
semi-automatic pipeline in which large models draft candidate responses
subsequently reviewed and modified by over 50 expert annotators with strong
e-commerce and multilingual expertise. We define difficulty levels for each
question and task category by averaging evaluation scores across models with
different sizes and capabilities, enabling challenge-oriented and fine-grained
assessment. EcomEval also spans seven languages-including five low-resource
Southeast Asian languages-offering a multilingual perspective absent from prior
work.

Result: The approach provides a framework to measure adaptability, distinguishing between closed-ended and open-ended benchmarks, with emphasis on testing models' ability to handle state changes in scaling environments.

Conclusion: Truly super-intelligent models should demonstrate at least second-order adaptability, enabling self-sustained computation through digital replenishment for achieving optimal fluidity in dynamic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the fragmented and incoherent landscape of integrating ML within rational agent architectures, which often overlooks the expressive power of established rational architectures like BDI agents.

Method: The method involves a fine-grained systematisation of existing approaches using the BDI paradigm as a reference framework to analyze the literature on rational agents enhanced by ML.

Result: The analysis illustrates the fast-evolving literature on rational agents enhanced by ML and identifies key research opportunities in this domain.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by highlighting open challenges and research opportunities for designing effective rational ML agents, emphasizing the need for more coherent integration approaches.

Abstract: Thanks to the remarkable human-like capabilities of machine learning (ML)

*Xue Wen Tan,Nathaniel Tan,Galen Lee,Stanley Kok*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a topological data analysis framework for automated evaluation of reasoning traces from large language models, showing it outperforms traditional graph-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for evaluating reasoning traces are labor-intensive, unreliable, and rely on manual annotation. Graph-based proxies are overly simplistic and don't capture what constitutes high-quality reasoning.

Method: Uses topological data analysis (TDA) to capture the geometry of reasoning traces, enabling label-efficient automated assessment with topological features.

Result: Topological features show substantially higher predictive power for assessing reasoning quality than standard graph metrics. A compact, stable set of topological features reliably indicates trace quality.

Conclusion: Effective reasoning is better captured by higher-dimensional geometric structures rather than purely relational graphs, offering a practical signal for future reinforcement learning algorithms.

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of reasoning traces from large language models remains
understudied, labor-intensive, and unreliable: current practice relies on
expert rubrics, manual annotation, and slow pairwise judgments. Automated
efforts are dominated by graph-based proxies that quantify structural
connectivity but do not clarify what constitutes high-quality reasoning; such
abstractions can be overly simplistic for inherently complex processes. We
introduce a topological data analysis (TDA)-based evaluation framework that
captures the geometry of reasoning traces and enables label-efficient,
automated assessment. In our empirical study, topological features yield
substantially higher predictive power for assessing reasoning quality than
standard graph metrics, suggesting that effective reasoning is better captured
by higher-dimensional geometric structures rather than purely relational
graphs. We further show that a compact, stable set of topological features
reliably indicates trace quality, offering a practical signal for future
reinforcement learning algorithms.

TL;DR: Graph-RFT is a two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning framework for KGQA that enables LLMs to perform autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval across KG and web sources under incomplete knowledge conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KGQA methods struggle to fully exploit both KG knowledge and LLM reasoning capabilities, assuming complete KG coverage and lacking mechanisms to judge when external information is needed, with locally myopic reasoning that fails to maintain coherent multi-step planning.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Chain-of-thought fine-tuning with plan-retrieval dataset to activate structured reasoning, 2) Plan-retrieval guided RL with explicit planning/retrieval actions, Cartesian-inspired planning module for question decomposition, and logical expression-guided tool invocation for consistent multi-step reasoning.

Result: The framework enables coverage-aware retrieval scheduling and effective combination of KG and web retrieval through multi-reward optimization combining outcome and retrieval-specific signals.

Conclusion: Graph-RFT addresses key limitations in current KGQA approaches by enabling autonomous planning, adaptive retrieval scheduling, and globally consistent multi-step reasoning under incomplete knowledge conditions.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering aims to answer natural language questions
by reasoning over structured knowledge graphs. While large language models have
advanced KGQA through their strong reasoning capabilities, existing methods
continue to struggle to fully exploit both the rich knowledge encoded in KGs
and the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, particularly in complex scenarios. They
often assume complete KG coverage and lack mechanisms to judge when external
information is needed, and their reasoning remains locally myopic, failing to
maintain coherent multi-step planning, leading to reasoning failures even when
relevant knowledge exists. We propose Graph-RFT, a novel two-stage
reinforcement fine-tuning KGQA framework with a
'plan-KGsearch-and-Websearch-during-think' paradigm, that enables LLMs to
perform autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval scheduling across KG and web
sources under incomplete knowledge conditions. Graph-RFT introduces a
chain-of-thought fine-tuning method with a customized plan-retrieval dataset
activates structured reasoning and resolves the GRPO cold-start problem. It
then introduces a novel plan-retrieval guided reinforcement learning process
integrates explicit planning and retrieval actions with a multi-reward design,
enabling coverage-aware retrieval scheduling. It employs a Cartesian-inspired
planning module to decompose complex questions into ordered subquestions, and
logical expression to guide tool invocation for globally consistent multi-step
reasoning. This reasoning retrieval process is optimized with a multi-reward
combining outcome and retrieval specific signals, enabling the model to learn
when and how to combine KG and web retrieval effectively.

### [127] [A Coherence-Based Measure of AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20784)
*Fares Fourati*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a coherence-aware AGI measure using generalized means AUC instead of arithmetic mean, showing GPT-4/5 remain far from general competence despite high arithmetic scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The arithmetic mean definition of AGI assumes compensability (exceptional ability can offset failure), but true general intelligence should reflect balanced competence across all essential domains (coherent sufficiency).

Method: Proposed a coherence-aware AGI measure based on the integral of generalized means over a continuum of compensability exponents, spanning arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic regimes.

Result: Applied to GPT-4 and GPT-5 CHC-based domain scores, the coherence-adjusted AUC reveals both systems remain far from general competence despite high arithmetic scores (GPT-5 at 24%).

Conclusion: The generalized mean AUC provides a principled, interpretable, and stricter foundation for measuring genuine progress toward AGI by penalizing imbalance and capturing inter-domain dependency.

Abstract: Recent work by \citet{hendrycks2025agidefinition} formalized
\textit{Artificial General Intelligence} (AGI) as the arithmetic mean of
proficiencies across cognitive domains derived from the Cattell--Horn--Carroll
(CHC) model of human cognition. While elegant, this definition assumes
\textit{compensability} -- that exceptional ability in some domains can offset
failure in others. True general intelligence, however, should reflect
\textit{coherent sufficiency}: balanced competence across all essential
domains. We propose a coherence-aware measure of AGI based on the integral of
generalized means over a continuum of compensability exponents. This
formulation spans arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic regimes, and the
resulting \textit{area under the curve} (AUC) quantifies robustness under
varying compensability assumptions. Unlike the arithmetic mean, which rewards
specialization, the AUC penalizes imbalance and captures inter-domain
dependency. Applied to published CHC-based domain scores for GPT-4 and GPT-5,
the coherence-adjusted AUC reveals that both systems remain far from general
competence despite high arithmetic scores (e.g., GPT-5 at~24\%). Integrating
the generalized mean thus yields a principled, interpretable, and stricter
foundation for measuring genuine progress toward AGI.

*Renzhao Liang,Sizhe Xu,Chenggang Xie,Jingru Chen,Feiyang Ren,Shu Yang,Takahiro Yabe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper challenges the conventional 'long-sequence information gain hypothesis' in time series forecasting and proposes AMRC, a method that improves prediction accuracy by adaptively masking redundant historical data and enforcing representation consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address limitations in deep learning-based time series forecasting models, which often learn redundant features like noise and irrelevant fluctuations from long historical sequences, compromising effective signal extraction.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Masking Loss with Representation Consistency (AMRC) with two components: 1) Dynamic masking loss that identifies discriminative temporal segments to guide training, and 2) Representation consistency constraint that stabilizes input-label-prediction mappings.

Result: Experimental results show AMRC effectively suppresses redundant feature learning and significantly improves model performance in time series forecasting tasks.

Conclusion: This work challenges conventional temporal modeling assumptions and provides novel theoretical insights and methodological breakthroughs for developing efficient and robust forecasting models.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a pivotal role in critical domains such as
energy management and financial markets. Although deep learning-based
approaches (e.g., MLP, RNN, Transformer) have achieved remarkable progress, the
prevailing "long-sequence information gain hypothesis" exhibits inherent
limitations. Through systematic experimentation, this study reveals a
counterintuitive phenomenon: appropriately truncating historical data can
paradoxically enhance prediction accuracy, indicating that existing models
learn substantial redundant features (e.g., noise or irrelevant fluctuations)
during training, thereby compromising effective signal extraction. Building
upon information bottleneck theory, we propose an innovative solution termed
Adaptive Masking Loss with Representation Consistency (AMRC), which features
two core components: 1) Dynamic masking loss, which adaptively identified
highly discriminative temporal segments to guide gradient descent during model
training; 2) Representation consistency constraint, which stabilized the
mapping relationships among inputs, labels, and predictions. Experimental
results demonstrate that AMRC effectively suppresses redundant feature learning
while significantly improving model performance. This work not only challenges
conventional assumptions in temporal modeling but also provides novel
theoretical insights and methodological breakthroughs for developing efficient
and robust forecasting models.

*Reuben Dorent,Polina Golland,William Wells III*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper derives a tight, tractable lower bound on mutual information (MI) via Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD), providing theoretical justification for using discriminative learning in MI-based representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between surrogate objectives (like JSD) and mutual information, as the connection between these alternative dependence measures and MI remains poorly understood despite their widespread use.

Method: Derived a new tight lower bound on Kullback-Leibler divergence as a function of JSD, specialized to joint and marginal distributions, and implemented it via binary classifier cross-entropy loss.

Result: Extensive experiments show the lower bound is tight for MI estimation, providing stable, low-variance estimates that outperform state-of-the-art neural estimators across various reference scenarios.

Conclusion: The work provides new theoretical justifications and strong empirical evidence for using discriminative learning in MI-based representation learning, with practical applications in Information Bottleneck framework.

Abstract: Mutual Information (MI) is a fundamental measure of statistical dependence
widely used in representation learning. While direct optimization of MI via its
definition as a Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) is often intractable, many
recent methods have instead maximized alternative dependence measures, most
notably, the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between joint and product of
marginal distributions via discriminative losses. However, the connection
between these surrogate objectives and MI remains poorly understood. In this
work, we bridge this gap by deriving a new, tight, and tractable lower bound on
KLD as a function of JSD in the general case. By specializing this bound to
joint and marginal distributions, we demonstrate that maximizing the JSD-based
information increases a guaranteed lower bound on mutual information.
Furthermore, we revisit the practical implementation of JSD-based objectives
and observe that minimizing the cross-entropy loss of a binary classifier
trained to distinguish joint from marginal pairs recovers a known variational
lower bound on the JSD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our lower bound
is tight when applied to MI estimation. We compared our lower bound to
state-of-the-art neural estimators of variational lower bound across a range of
established reference scenarios. Our lower bound estimator consistently
provides a stable, low-variance estimate of a tight lower bound on MI. We also
demonstrate its practical usefulness in the context of the Information
Bottleneck framework. Taken together, our results provide new theoretical
justifications and strong empirical evidence for using discriminative learning
in MI-based representation learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid SSM-Transformer architectures show complete functional segregation: retrieval depends exclusively on self-attention layers, while SSM layers show no compensatory mechanisms. Sparsifying attention to 15% of heads maintains near-perfect retrieval while preserving most MMLU performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the functional specialization and redundancy in hybrid SSM-Transformer architectures, challenging assumptions about integrated systems.

Method: Conducted attention ablation experiments on RecurrentGemma-2B/9B and Jamba-Mini-1.6 models, tested retrieval accuracy with different attention sparsity levels, and identified mechanistic requirements for retrieval.

Result: Attention ablation caused catastrophic retrieval failure (0% accuracy), while SSM layers showed no compensatory mechanisms. Sparsifying attention to 15% of heads maintained near-perfect retrieval while preserving 84% MMLU performance.

Conclusion: Hybrid architectures operate as specialized modules rather than integrated systems, with self-attention specializing primarily for retrieval tasks, having immediate implications for architecture optimization and interpretability.

Abstract: We demonstrate complete functional segregation in hybrid SSM-Transformer
architectures: retrieval depends exclusively on self-attention layers. Across
RecurrentGemma-2B/9B and Jamba-Mini-1.6, attention ablation causes catastrophic
retrieval failure (0% accuracy), while SSM layers show no compensatory
mechanisms even with improved prompting. Conversely, sparsifying attention to
just 15% of heads maintains near-perfect retrieval while preserving 84% MMLU
performance, suggesting self-attention specializes primarily for retrieval
tasks. We identify precise mechanistic requirements for retrieval: needle
tokens must be exposed during generation and sufficient context must be
available during prefill or generation. This strict functional specialization
challenges assumptions about redundancy in hybrid architectures and suggests
these models operate as specialized modules rather than integrated systems,
with immediate implications for architecture optimization and interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NAS-DQN integrates neural architecture search directly into DRL training, enabling dynamic network reconfiguration that outperforms fixed architectures in performance, sample efficiency, and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional DRL agents use fixed neural architectures chosen through expensive hyperparameter searches, which constrains performance and cannot adapt during training.

Method: NAS-DQN integrates a learned neural architecture search controller into the DRL training loop, allowing dynamic network reconfiguration based on cumulative performance feedback.

Result: NAS-DQN achieves superior final performance, sample efficiency, and policy stability compared to fixed-architecture baselines and random search, with negligible computational overhead.

Conclusion: Architecture adaptation is necessary for optimal sample efficiency in online DRL, and RL agent design can be integrated as a dynamic component of the learning process rather than a static offline choice.

Abstract: The performance of deep reinforcement learning agents is fundamentally
constrained by their neural network architecture, a choice traditionally made
through expensive hyperparameter searches and then fixed throughout training.
This work investigates whether online, adaptive architecture optimization can
escape this constraint and outperform static designs. We introduce NAS-DQN, an
agent that integrates a learned neural architecture search controller directly
into the DRL training loop, enabling dynamic network reconfiguration based on
cumulative performance feedback. We evaluate NAS-DQN against three
fixed-architecture baselines and a random search control on a continuous
control task, conducting experiments over multiple random seeds. Our results
demonstrate that NAS-DQN achieves superior final performance, sample
efficiency, and policy stability while incurring negligible computational
overhead. Critically, the learned search strategy substantially outperforms
both undirected random architecture exploration and poorly-chosen fixed
designs, indicating that intelligent, performance-guided search is the key
mechanism driving success. These findings establish that architecture
adaptation is not merely beneficial but necessary for optimal sample efficiency
in online deep reinforcement learning, and suggest that the design of RL agents
need not be a static offline choice but can instead be seamlessly integrated as
a dynamic component of the learning process itself.

TL;DR: A hybrid Bayesian mixture-of-experts framework fuses physical path-loss models with CNNs using building-height maps to improve GNSS jammer localization and RSS field reconstruction in urban environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNSS signals are vulnerable to jamming in urban areas where multipath and shadowing distort received power. Previous data-driven approaches achieved reasonable localization but poorly reconstructed RSS fields due to limited spatial context.

Method: Hybrid Bayesian mixture-of-experts framework that fuses physical path-loss model and CNN through log-linear pooling. CNN leverages building-height maps to capture urban propagation effects. Uses Bayesian inference with Laplace approximation for posterior uncertainty estimation.

Result: Experiments on urban ray-tracing data show improved localization accuracy and reduced uncertainty with more training points. Uncertainty concentrates near the jammer and along urban canyons where propagation is most sensitive.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid framework effectively combines physical consistency with data-driven learning to improve jammer localization and RSS field reconstruction in challenging urban environments.

Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are vulnerable to jamming,
particularly in urban areas where multipath and shadowing distort received
power. Previous data-driven approaches achieved reasonable localization but
poorly reconstructed the received signal strength (RSS) field due to limited
spatial context. We propose a hybrid Bayesian mixture-of-experts framework that
fuses a physical path-loss (PL) model and a convolutional neural network (CNN)
through log-linear pooling. The PL expert ensures physical consistency, while
the CNN leverages building-height maps to capture urban propagation effects.
Bayesian inference with Laplace approximation provides posterior uncertainty
over both the jammer position and RSS field. Experiments on urban ray-tracing
data show that localization accuracy improves and uncertainty decreases with
more training points, while uncertainty concentrates near the jammer and along
urban canyons where propagation is most sensitive.

TL;DR: ReGraphT is a training-free framework that enables small language models to achieve LLM-level performance in CUDA code generation by using retrieval-augmented generation with reasoning graphs and Monte Carlo Graph Search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based CUDA generation faces privacy risks with cloud APIs and computational inefficiency with local deployment. While SLMs are more lightweight and privacy-friendly, their limited reasoning abilities lead to suboptimal CUDA generation performance.

Method: ReGraphT organizes CUDA optimization trajectories into structured reasoning graphs, models CUDA optimizations as state transitions, and uses Monte Carlo Graph Search for efficient exploration. It's a training-free, retrieval-augmented generation framework.

Result: ReGraphT outperforms HPC-specific fine-tuned models and other retrieval-augmented approaches, achieving 2.33X average speedup on CUDAEval and ParEval. When paired with specific SLMs, it enables them to approach LLM-level performance without privacy risks or excessive computing overhead.

Conclusion: ReGraphT successfully bridges the performance gap between SLMs and LLMs in CUDA code generation, providing a privacy-friendly and computationally efficient alternative to large language models while maintaining comparable performance.

Abstract: Despite significant evolution of CUDA programming and domain-specific
libraries, effectively utilizing GPUs with massively parallel engines remains
difficult. Large language models (LLMs) show strong potential in generating
optimized CUDA code from sequential code. However, using LLMs in practice faces
two major challenges: cloud-based APIs pose risks of code leakage, and local
deployment is often computationally expensive and inefficient. These drawbacks
have spurred interest in small language models (SLMs), which are more
lightweight and privacy-friendly. Encouragingly, recent studies show that SLMs
can achieve performance comparable to LLMs on specific tasks. While SLMs can
match LLMs on domain-specific tasks, their limited reasoning abilities lead to
suboptimal performance in complex CUDA generation according to our experiments.
To bridge this gap, we propose ReGraphT, a training-free, retrieval-augmented
generation framework that transfers LLM-level reasoning to smaller models.
ReGraphT organizes CUDA optimization trajectories into a structured reasoning
graph, modeling the combined CUDA optimizations as state transitions, and
leverages Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. We also
present a CUDA-specific benchmark with difficulty tiers defined by reasoning
complexity to evaluate models more comprehensively. Experiments show that
ReGraphT outperforms HPC-specific fine-tuned models and other
retrieval-augmented approaches, achieving an average 2.33X speedup on CUDAEval
and ParEval. When paired with DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct and
Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct, ReGraphT enables SLMs to approach LLM-level
performance without the associated privacy risks or excessive computing
overhead.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Transformer-based deep learning model is proposed to predict equilibrium path flows for traffic assignment, offering significant speed improvements over traditional optimization methods while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional traffic assignment methods become computationally prohibitive for large-scale networks due to non-linear complexity growth with OD pairs, requiring a more efficient approach.

Method: Uses deep neural networks with Transformer architecture to predict equilibrium path flows directly, capturing correlations between OD pairs at the path level rather than link level.

Result: The model is orders of magnitude faster than conventional optimization, efficiently estimates path-level traffic flows in multi-class networks, and adapts to varying demand and network conditions.

Conclusion: The Transformer-based approach reduces computational costs, improves prediction accuracy, and enables rapid 'what-if' analyses for enhanced transportation planning and policy-making.

Abstract: The traffic assignment problem is essential for traffic flow analysis,
traditionally solved using mathematical programs under the Equilibrium
principle. These methods become computationally prohibitive for large-scale
networks due to non-linear growth in complexity with the number of OD pairs.
This study introduces a novel data-driven approach using deep neural networks,
specifically leveraging the Transformer architecture, to predict equilibrium
path flows directly. By focusing on path-level traffic distribution, the
proposed model captures intricate correlations between OD pairs, offering a
more detailed and flexible analysis compared to traditional link-level
approaches. The Transformer-based model drastically reduces computation time,
while adapting to changes in demand and network structure without the need for
recalculation. Numerical experiments are conducted on the Manhattan-like
synthetic network, the Sioux Falls network, and the Eastern-Massachusetts
network. The results demonstrate that the proposed model is orders of magnitude
faster than conventional optimization. It efficiently estimates path-level
traffic flows in multi-class networks, reducing computational costs and
improving prediction accuracy by capturing detailed trip and flow information.
The model also adapts flexibly to varying demand and network conditions,
supporting traffic management and enabling rapid `what-if' analyses for
enhanced transportation planning and policy-making.

TL;DR: FairGRPO is a hierarchical reinforcement learning method that reduces performance disparities across demographic groups in medical AI systems by using adaptive importance weighting and unsupervised clustering for fairness-aware training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical AI systems show performance disparities across demographic groups, causing harm to underrepresented populations, and existing multimodal reasoning models amplify biases from training data dominated by majority populations.

Method: FairGRPO uses hierarchical reinforcement learning with adaptive importance weighting based on representation, task difficulty, and data source, plus unsupervised clustering to discover latent demographic groups when labels are unavailable.

Result: Across 7 clinical datasets spanning 5 modalities, FairGRPO reduces predictive parity by 27.2% against baselines while improving F1 score by 12.49%, and progressively improves fairness throughout training.

Conclusion: FairGRPO effectively addresses fairness issues in medical AI, leading to the release of FairMedGemma-4B, a fairness-aware clinical VLLM with state-of-the-art performance and reduced demographic disparities.

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence systems have achieved remarkable diagnostic
capabilities, yet they consistently exhibit performance disparities across
demographic groups, causing real-world harm to underrepresented populations.
While recent multimodal reasoning foundation models have advanced clinical
diagnosis through integrated analysis of diverse medical data, reasoning
trainings via reinforcement learning inherit and often amplify biases present
in training datasets dominated by majority populations. We introduce
Fairness-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (FairGRPO), a hierarchical
reinforcement learning approach that promotes equitable learning across
heterogeneous clinical populations. FairGRPO employs adaptive importance
weighting of advantages based on representation, task difficulty, and data
source. To address the common issue of missing demographic labels in the
clinical domain, we further employ unsupervised clustering, which automatically
discovers latent demographic groups when labels are unavailable. Through
comprehensive experiments across 7 clinical diagnostic datasets spanning 5
clinical modalities across X-ray, CT scan, dermoscropy, mammography and
ultrasound, we demonstrate that FairGRPO reduces predictive parity by 27.2%
against all vanilla and bias mitigated RL baselines, while improving F1 score
by 12.49%. Furthermore, training dynamics analysis reveals that FairGRPO
progressively improves fairness throughout optimization, while baseline RL
methods exhibit deteriorating fairness as training progresses. Based on
FairGRPO, we release FairMedGemma-4B, a fairness-aware clinical VLLM that
achieves state-of-the-art performance while demonstrating significantly reduced
disparities across demographic groups.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To support urinary tract disease diagnosis, particularly bladder cancer, by developing transparent and effective predictive models using explainable AI techniques.

Method: Used XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost algorithms with Optuna for hyperparameter optimization and SMOTE for class balancing. Applied SHAP-based feature selection to identify important predictive variables across six binary classification scenarios.

Result: SHAP-based feature selection maintained or improved performance metrics (balanced accuracy, precision, specificity) while enhancing model transparency and interpretability.

Conclusion: Explainability techniques like SHAP for feature selection are effective for developing transparent, reliable clinical decision support systems that can optimize screening and early diagnosis of urinary tract diseases.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an approach to support the diagnosis of urinary
tract diseases, with a focus on bladder cancer, using SHAP (SHapley Additive
exPlanations)-based feature selection to enhance the transparency and
effectiveness of predictive models. Six binary classification scenarios were
developed to distinguish bladder cancer from other urological and oncological
conditions. The algorithms XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost were employed, with
hyperparameter optimization performed using Optuna and class balancing with the
SMOTE technique. The selection of predictive variables was guided by importance
values through SHAP-based feature selection while maintaining or even improving
performance metrics such as balanced accuracy, precision, and specificity. The
use of explainability techniques (SHAP) for feature selection proved to be an
effective approach. The proposed methodology may contribute to the development
of more transparent, reliable, and efficient clinical decision support systems,
optimizing screening and early diagnosis of urinary tract diseases.

TL;DR: FINDER is a classification framework for noisy datasets that uses stochastic analysis and Hilbert space mapping to create stochastic features, then applies KLE decomposition to identify class-specific regions through eigen-decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address classification challenges in noisy datasets with low signal-to-noise ratios, small sample sizes, and faulty data collection, which remain key research frontiers.

Method: Views datasets as realizations from random fields, maps them to Hilbert spaces to create stochastic features, uses Kosambi-Karhunen-Loève expansion for decomposition, and performs classification via eigen-decomposition of operator spectra.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art breakthroughs in Alzheimer's Disease stage classification and remote sensing deforestation detection on challenging, data-deficient scientific domains.

Conclusion: FINDER provides a rigorous framework for noisy dataset classification with demonstrated success, though it has specific conditions for optimal performance and certain failure modes and limitations.

Abstract: ''Noisy'' datasets (regimes with low signal to noise ratios, small sample
sizes, faulty data collection, etc) remain a key research frontier for
classification methods with both theoretical and practical implications. We
introduce FINDER, a rigorous framework for analyzing generic classification
problems, with tailored algorithms for noisy datasets. FINDER incorporates
fundamental stochastic analysis ideas into the feature learning and inference
stages to optimally account for the randomness inherent to all empirical
datasets. We construct ''stochastic features'' by first viewing empirical
datasets as realizations from an underlying random field (without assumptions
on its exact distribution) and then mapping them to appropriate Hilbert spaces.
The Kosambi-Karhunen-Lo\'eve expansion (KLE) breaks these stochastic features
into computable irreducible components, which allow classification over noisy
datasets via an eigen-decomposition: data from different classes resides in
distinct regions, identified by analyzing the spectrum of the associated
operators. We validate FINDER on several challenging, data-deficient scientific
domains, producing state of the art breakthroughs in: (i) Alzheimer's Disease
stage classification, (ii) Remote sensing detection of deforestation. We end
with a discussion on when FINDER is expected to outperform existing methods,
its failure modes, and other limitations.

TL;DR: First theoretical analysis of Muon optimizer's practical inexact orthogonalization, showing performance degradation depends on approximation error and revealing coupling between step size/momentum and oracle precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge theory-practice gap in Muon optimizer analysis by moving beyond idealized exact SVD updates to study practical approximate orthogonalization schemes.

Method: Analyze inexact orthogonalized updates within Linear Minimization Oracle framework using additive error model, deriving explicit bounds for performance degradation.

Result: Revealed fundamental coupling: lower oracle precision requires smaller step size but larger momentum. NanoGPT experiments confirmed predicted coupling with learning rate shifts.

Conclusion: Approximation procedure (e.g., Newton-Schulz steps) must be co-tuned with learning schedule as a critical parameter, not just an implementation detail.

Abstract: The Muon optimizer has rapidly emerged as a powerful, geometry-aware
alternative to AdamW, demonstrating strong performance in large-scale training
of neural networks. However, a critical theory-practice disconnect exists:
Muon's efficiency relies on fast, approximate orthogonalization, yet all prior
theoretical work analyzes an idealized, computationally intractable version
assuming exact SVD-based updates. This work moves beyond the ideal by providing
the first analysis of the inexact orthogonalized update at Muon's core. We
develop our analysis within the general framework of Linear Minimization Oracle
(LMO)-based optimization, introducing a realistic additive error model to
capture the inexactness of practical approximation schemes. Our analysis yields
explicit bounds that quantify performance degradation as a function of the LMO
inexactness/error. We reveal a fundamental coupling between this inexactness
and the optimal step size and momentum: lower oracle precision requires a
smaller step size but larger momentum parameter. These findings elevate the
approximation procedure (e.g., the number of Newton-Schulz steps) from an
implementation detail to a critical parameter that must be co-tuned with the
learning schedule. NanoGPT experiments directly confirm the predicted coupling,
with optimal learning rates clearly shifting as approximation precision
changes.

### [140] [Mitigating Privacy-Utility Trade-off in Decentralized Federated Learning via $f$-Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19934)
*Xiang Li,Buxin Su,Chendi Wang,Qi Long,Weijie J. Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops new f-DP-based privacy accounting methods for decentralized federated learning, providing tighter privacy bounds than existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately quantifying privacy budget in decentralized FL is challenging due to complex components like decentralized communication and local updates, which existing methods struggle to capture effectively.

Method: Developed two new f-DP accounting methods: PN-f-DP for privacy leakage between user pairs under random-walk communication, and Sec-f-LDP for structured noise injection via shared secrets, combining f-DP theory with Markov chain concentration.

Result: Experiments show consistently tighter (ε,δ) bounds and improved utility compared to Rényi DP-based approaches, demonstrating benefits of f-DP in decentralized privacy accounting.

Conclusion: The proposed f-DP framework effectively captures privacy amplification from sparse communication, local iterations, and correlated noise in decentralized FL settings.

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) decentralized Federated Learning (FL) allows
local users to collaborate without sharing their data with a central server.
However, accurately quantifying the privacy budget of private FL algorithms is
challenging due to the co-existence of complex algorithmic components such as
decentralized communication and local updates. This paper addresses privacy
accounting for two decentralized FL algorithms within the $f$-differential
privacy ($f$-DP) framework. We develop two new $f$-DP-based accounting methods
tailored to decentralized settings: Pairwise Network $f$-DP (PN-$f$-DP), which
quantifies privacy leakage between user pairs under random-walk communication,
and Secret-based $f$-Local DP (Sec-$f$-LDP), which supports structured noise
injection via shared secrets. By combining tools from $f$-DP theory and Markov
chain concentration, our accounting framework captures privacy amplification
arising from sparse communication, local iterations, and correlated noise.
Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our methods yield
consistently tighter $(\epsilon,\delta)$ bounds and improved utility compared
to R\'enyi DP-based approaches, illustrating the benefits of $f$-DP in
decentralized privacy accounting.

*Matan Tsipory,Ran Levinstein,Itay Evron,Mark Kong,Deanna Needell,Daniel Soudry*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Analysis of greedy task orderings in continual learning for linear regression, showing faster convergence than random orderings but with repetition-dependent performance differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the effectiveness of greedy dissimilarity-maximizing task orderings in continual learning, which were briefly explored in prior work but lacked comprehensive analysis.

Method: Used tools from Kaczmarz method literature to formalize greedy orderings, developed geometric and algebraic intuitions, and conducted empirical tests on linear regression and CIFAR-100 classification, plus theoretical analysis under different rank conditions.

Result: Greedy orderings converge faster than random ones in average loss. However, single-pass greedy orderings can fail catastrophically while those allowing repetition converge at O(1/∛k) rate, compared to O(1/√k) for random orderings.

Conclusion: Greedy and random orderings have nuanced differences - greedy orderings generally perform better but require careful handling of repetition to avoid catastrophic failure, revealing important trade-offs in continual learning task scheduling.

Abstract: We analyze task orderings in continual learning for linear regression,
assuming joint realizability of training data. We focus on orderings that
greedily maximize dissimilarity between consecutive tasks, a concept briefly
explored in prior work but still surrounded by open questions. Using tools from
the Kaczmarz method literature, we formalize such orderings and develop
geometric and algebraic intuitions around them. Empirically, we demonstrate
that greedy orderings converge faster than random ones in terms of the average
loss across tasks, both for linear regression with random data and for linear
probing on CIFAR-100 classification tasks. Analytically, in a high-rank
regression setting, we prove a loss bound for greedy orderings analogous to
that of random ones. However, under general rank, we establish a
repetition-dependent separation. Specifically, while prior work showed that for
random orderings, with or without replacement, the average loss after $k$
iterations is bounded by $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{k})$, we prove that single-pass
greedy orderings may fail catastrophically, whereas those allowing repetition
converge at rate $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt[3]{k})$. Overall, we reveal nuances
within and between greedy and random orderings.

*Shaocong Ma,Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A robust RL method using elliptic uncertainty sets to address market impact mismatch between training and live trading environments, with closed-form solutions for worst-case uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL agents trained on historical data face performance degradation during live deployment due to market impact - their own trades shifting prices, which isn't captured in training.

Method: Developed novel elliptic uncertainty sets that capture directional nature of market impact, with implicit and explicit closed-form solutions for worst-case uncertainty enabling efficient robust policy evaluation.

Result: Experiments on single-asset and multi-asset trading tasks show superior Sharpe ratio and robustness under increasing trade volumes compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: The method provides a more faithful and scalable approach to RL in financial markets by properly addressing the directional nature of market impact through specialized uncertainty sets.

Abstract: In financial applications, reinforcement learning (RL) agents are commonly
trained on historical data, where their actions do not influence prices.
However, during deployment, these agents trade in live markets where their own
transactions can shift asset prices, a phenomenon known as market impact. This
mismatch between training and deployment environments can significantly degrade
performance. Traditional robust RL approaches address this model
misspecification by optimizing the worst-case performance over a set of
uncertainties, but typically rely on symmetric structures that fail to capture
the directional nature of market impact. To address this issue, we develop a
novel class of elliptic uncertainty sets. We establish both implicit and
explicit closed-form solutions for the worst-case uncertainty under these sets,
enabling efficient and tractable robust policy evaluation. Experiments on
single-asset and multi-asset trading tasks demonstrate that our method achieves
superior Sharpe ratio and remains robust under increasing trade volumes,
offering a more faithful and scalable approach to RL in financial markets.

*Shaocong Ma,Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes novel unbiased gradient estimators for zeroth-order optimization using function evaluations, eliminating bias while maintaining low variance, with optimal complexity for smooth non-convex objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zeroth-order optimization methods suffer from biased gradient estimators unless perturbation stepsize vanishes, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Reformulates directional derivatives as telescoping series and samples from carefully designed distributions to construct unbiased estimators based solely on function evaluations.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows optimal complexity for smooth non-convex objectives, with experiments demonstrating superior accuracy and convergence compared to standard methods on synthetic tasks and language model fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed family of unbiased gradient estimators successfully overcomes the bias limitation in zeroth-order optimization while maintaining favorable variance properties.

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimization (ZOO) is an important framework for stochastic
optimization when gradients are unavailable or expensive to compute. A
potential limitation of existing ZOO methods is the bias inherent in most
gradient estimators unless the perturbation stepsize vanishes. In this paper,
we overcome this biasedness issue by proposing a novel family of unbiased
gradient estimators based solely on function evaluations. By reformulating
directional derivatives as a telescoping series and sampling from carefully
designed distributions, we construct estimators that eliminate bias while
maintaining favorable variance. We analyze their theoretical properties, derive
optimal scaling distributions and perturbation stepsizes of four specific
constructions, and prove that SGD using the proposed estimators achieves
optimal complexity for smooth non-convex objectives. Experiments on synthetic
tasks and language model fine-tuning confirm the superior accuracy and
convergence of our approach compared to standard methods.

### [144] [Revisiting Zeroth-Order Optimization: Minimum-Variance Two-Point Estimators and Directionally Aligned Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19975)
*Shaocong Ma,Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes directionally aligned perturbations (DAPs) for zeroth-order gradient estimation, showing they minimize asymptotic variance and outperform traditional fixed-length perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research has focused on fixed-length perturbations for zeroth-order gradient estimation, overlooking the potential advantages of directional alignment with the true gradient.

Method: Formulated as a constrained functional optimization problem to find perturbation distributions that minimize asymptotic variance. Proposed DAP scheme that adaptively aligns perturbations with critical gradient directions.

Result: DAPs outperform traditional methods in empirical evaluations on synthetic problems and practical tasks under specific conditions. Provided convergence analysis for SGD with δ-unbiased random perturbations.

Conclusion: Directionally aligned perturbations offer higher accuracy along critical directions and extend zeroth-order optimization capabilities beyond traditional fixed-length approaches.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the two-point zeroth-order gradient estimator and
identify the distribution of random perturbations that minimizes the
estimator's asymptotic variance as the perturbation stepsize tends to zero. We
formulate it as a constrained functional optimization problem over the space of
perturbation distributions. Our findings reveal that such desired perturbations
can align directionally with the true gradient, instead of maintaining a fixed
length. While existing research has largely focused on fixed-length
perturbations, the potential advantages of directional alignment have been
overlooked. To address this gap, we delve into the theoretical and empirical
properties of the directionally aligned perturbation (DAP) scheme, which
adaptively offers higher accuracy along critical directions. Additionally, we
provide a convergence analysis for stochastic gradient descent using
$\delta$-unbiased random perturbations, extending existing complexity bounds to
a wider range of perturbations. Through empirical evaluations on both synthetic
problems and practical tasks, we demonstrate that DAPs outperform traditional
methods under specific conditions.

*Hanbin Hong,Ashish Kundu,Ali Payani,Binghui Wang,Yuan Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UCAN introduces anisotropic noise for randomized smoothing to improve certified adversarial robustness by tailoring noise distributions to data dimension heterogeneity, achieving significant performance gains over isotropic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current randomized smoothing methods use isotropic noise that treats all data dimensions uniformly, limiting certification effectiveness by ignoring input heterogeneity across different dimensions.

Method: UCAN transforms existing randomized smoothing methods from isotropic to anisotropic noise distributions, using a theoretical framework that supports various noise distributions and develops noise parameter generators to fine-tune anisotropic noise parameters for different data dimensions.

Result: Empirical evaluations show up to 182.6% improvement in certified accuracy at large certified radii on MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: UCAN provides a universal framework for enhancing certified adversarial robustness through anisotropic noise, significantly outperforming existing isotropic approaches while maintaining theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Randomized smoothing has become essential for achieving certified adversarial
robustness in machine learning models. However, current methods primarily use
isotropic noise distributions that are uniform across all data dimensions, such
as image pixels, limiting the effectiveness of robustness certification by
ignoring the heterogeneity of inputs and data dimensions. To address this
limitation, we propose UCAN: a novel technique that \underline{U}niversally
\underline{C}ertifies adversarial robustness with \underline{A}nisotropic
\underline{N}oise. UCAN is designed to enhance any existing randomized
smoothing method, transforming it from symmetric (isotropic) to asymmetric
(anisotropic) noise distributions, thereby offering a more tailored defense
against adversarial attacks. Our theoretical framework is versatile, supporting
a wide array of noise distributions for certified robustness in different
$\ell_p$-norms and applicable to any arbitrary classifier by guaranteeing the
classifier's prediction over perturbed inputs with provable robustness bounds
through tailored noise injection. Additionally, we develop a novel framework
equipped with three exemplary noise parameter generators (NPGs) to optimally
fine-tune the anisotropic noise parameters for different data dimensions,
allowing for pursuing different levels of robustness enhancements in
practice.Empirical evaluations underscore the significant leap in UCAN's
performance over existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating up to
$182.6\%$ improvement in certified accuracy at large certified radii on MNIST,
CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets.\footnote{Code is anonymously available at

*Zachary Horvitz,Raghav Singhal,Hao Zou,Carles Domingo-Enrich,Zhou Yu,Rajesh Ranganath,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MDLMs offer unique inference capabilities beyond standard left-to-right decoding, enabling reasoning-as-infilling for structured outputs and multi-token entropy decoding for faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To justify the additional compute of MDLMs and demonstrate their advantages over left-to-right models, particularly for math and coding tasks where standard MDLM benefits don't materialize as expected.

Method: Proposed reasoning-as-infilling using templates to structure outputs, and multi-token entropy decoding (MED) - an adaptive sampler that minimizes parallel decoding errors based on conditional entropies.

Result: Fine-tuning on posterior reasoning traces provided performance boosts comparable to human-written traces, and MED preserved performance while reducing steps by 2.7x.

Conclusion: MDLMs unlock novel inference and post-training methods that justify their computational requirements, enabling structured reasoning, uncertainty measurement, and efficient parallel decoding.

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) are trained to in-fill positions in
randomly masked sequences, in contrast to next-token prediction models.
Discussions around MDLMs focus on two benefits: (1) any-order decoding and 2)
multi-token decoding. However, we observe that for math and coding tasks,
any-order algorithms often underperform or behave similarly to left-to-right
sampling, and standard multi-token decoding significantly degrades performance.
At inference time, MDLMs compute the conditional distribution of all masked
positions. A natural question is: How can we justify this additional compute
when left-to-right one-token-at-a-time decoding is on par with any-order
decoding algorithms? First, we propose reasoning-as-infilling. By using MDLMs
to infill a reasoning template, we can structure outputs and distinguish
between reasoning and answer tokens. In turn, this enables measuring answer
uncertainty during reasoning, and early exits when the model converges on an
answer. Next, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling enables sampling from the
MDLM posterior over reasoning traces conditioned on the answer, providing a new
source of high-quality data for post-training. On GSM8k, we observe that
fine-tuning LLaDA-8B Base on its posterior reasoning traces provides a
performance boost on par with fine-tuning on human-written reasoning traces.
Additionally, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling provides a method for
scoring the correctness of the reasoning process at intermediate steps. Second,
we propose multi-token entropy decoding (MED), a simple adaptive sampler that
minimizes the error incurred by decoding positions in parallel based on the
conditional entropies of those positions. MED preserves performance across
benchmarks and leads to 2.7x fewer steps. Our work demonstrates that the
training and compute used by MDLMs unlock many new inference and post-training
methods.

*Curtis Lee Shull,Merrick Green*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a supervised learning simulation using RFID RSSI data and Decision Tree classification for location inference in defense storage facilities, achieving 34.2% accuracy with challenges in classifying rare zones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RFID tracking is needed for defense asset storage security, but poor sensor specificity (long range detection, spoofing, counterfeiting) leads to erroneous detection and security events.

Method: Supervised learning simulation with realistic RSSI data and Decision Tree classification in a CAD-modeled floor plan, using 980,000 RFID reads to classify 12 lab zones with class weights to handle class imbalance.

Result: Model trained on 5,000 balanced observations achieved 34.2% overall accuracy, with F1-scores >0.40 for multiple zones (F, G, H), but rare classes (especially LabZoneC) were often misclassified despite class weights.

Conclusion: RSSI-based decision trees can enable zone-level anomaly detection for defense logistics, but performance in low-coverage zones needs improvement through better antenna placement or sensor fusion with other modalities.

Abstract: Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tracking may be a viable solution for
defense assets that must be stored in accordance with security guidelines.
However, poor sensor specificity (vulnerabilities include long range detection,
spoofing, and counterfeiting) can lead to erroneous detection and operational
security events. We present a supervised learning simulation with realistic
Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) data and Decision Tree classification
in a Computer Assisted Design (CAD)-modeled floor plan that encapsulates some
of the challenges encountered in defense storage. In this work, we focused on
classifying 12 lab zones (LabZoneA-L) to perform location inference. The raw
dataset had approximately 980,000 reads. Class frequencies were imbalanced, and
class weights were calculated to account for class imbalance in this
multi-class setting. The model, trained on stratified subsamples to 5,000
balanced observations, yielded an overall accuracy of 34.2% and F1-scores
greater than 0.40 for multiple zones (Zones F, G, H, etc.). However, rare
classes (most notably LabZoneC) were often misclassified, even with the use of
class weights. An adjacency-aware confusion matrix was calculated to allow
better interpretation of physically adjacent zones. These results suggest that
RSSI-based decision trees can be applied in realistic simulations to enable
zone-level anomaly detection or misplacement monitoring for defense supply
logistics. Reliable classification performance in low-coverage and low-signal
zones could be improved with better antenna placement or additional sensors and
sensor fusion with other modalities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SALT is a lightweight framework that provides fine-grained advantage assignment for group-based RL algorithms using outcome rewards, improving performance on complex multi-step tasks without significant computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL approaches for LLMs rely on sparse outcome-based rewards, which can lead to training instability and suboptimal policies when beneficial and detrimental actions are entangled in multi-step interactions, especially in group-based RL algorithms without critic models.

Method: SALT constructs a graph from trajectories of the same prompt to quantify the quality of each step and assign advantages accordingly. It's designed as a plug-and-play module that integrates with existing group-based RL algorithms without modifying rollout procedures.

Result: Extensive experiments on WebShop, ALFWorld, and AppWorld benchmarks with various model sizes show that SALT consistently improves performance. The framework introduces negligible computational overhead.

Conclusion: SALT effectively addresses the limitation of uniform reward assignment in group-based RL algorithms by providing fine-grained advantage assignment, leading to more stable training and better policies for complex multi-step tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities,
enabling language agents to excel at single-turn tasks. However, their
application to complex, multi-step, and long-horizon tasks remains challenging.
While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising avenue for addressing
these challenges, mainstream approaches typically rely solely on sparse,
outcome-based rewards, a limitation that becomes especially problematic for
group-based RL algorithms lacking critic models, such as Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). In such methods, uniformly rewarding or penalizing all
actions within a trajectory can lead to training instability and suboptimal
policies, because beneficial and detrimental actions are often entangled across
multi-step interactions. To address this challenge, we propose SALT, a novel
and lightweight framework that provides a finer-grained advantage assignment,
derived solely from outcome rewards. We achieve this by constructing a graph
from trajectories of the same prompt, which allows us to quantify the quality
of each step and assign advantages accordingly. Crucially, SALT is designed as
a plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates with existing group-based RL
algorithms, requiring no modifications to the rollout procedure and introducing
negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the WebShop,
ALFWorld, and AppWorld benchmarks with various model sizes demonstrate that
SALT consistently improves performance. We also conduct a thorough analysis to
validate the design choices behind SALT and offer actionable insights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bitcoin's rich transaction data has been largely inaccessible for ML research due to pseudonymity and the obscured flow of funds in its UTXO-based design, creating a gap in ML applications for cryptocurrency analysis.

Method: Created a temporal, heterogeneous graph modeling Bitcoin's economic topology by reconstructing fund flows, providing custom sampling methods for node/edge feature vectors, tools for graph database analysis, and ready-to-use database snapshots.

Result: Built a comprehensive dataset with >2.4B nodes and >39.72B edges covering Bitcoin's complete transaction history up to a cutoff block, making this previously inaccessible data available for ML research.

Conclusion: This dataset and toolkit empower the ML community to tackle Bitcoin's complex ecosystem at scale, enabling progress in anomaly detection, address classification, market analysis, and large-scale graph ML benchmarking.

Abstract: Since its 2009 genesis block, the Bitcoin network has processed \num{>1.08}
billion (B) transactions representing \num{>8.72}B BTC, offering rich potential

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel rejection sampling algorithm for exact parallel sampling from temporal point processes without architectural changes or retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive temporal point process models require sequential sampling, which limits efficiency for large-scale applications.

Method: Rejection sampling algorithm that enables exact parallel sampling of multiple future values from existing TPP models.

Result: Empirical speedups on real-world datasets while maintaining theoretical guarantees of exact sampling.

Conclusion: Bridges the gap between expressive modeling and efficient parallel generation for large-scale TPP applications.

Abstract: Temporal point processes are powerful generative models for event sequences
that capture complex dependencies in time-series data. They are commonly
specified using autoregressive models that learn the distribution of the next
event from the previous events. This makes sampling inherently sequential,
limiting efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm based on
rejection sampling that enables exact sampling of multiple future values from
existing TPP models, in parallel, and without requiring any architectural
changes or retraining. Besides theoretical guarantees, our method demonstrates
empirical speedups on real-world datasets, bridging the gap between expressive
modeling and efficient parallel generation for large-scale TPP applications.

TL;DR: Proposes a CMDP framework with delayed Poisson rewards for ad bidding, using a two-stage MLE and RL algorithm to achieve near-optimal regret bound.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in existing ad bidding strategies by jointly modeling delayed/long-term effects, cumulative impacts, and customer heterogeneity.

Method: Model ad bidding as Contextual MDP with delayed Poisson rewards; use two-stage MLE with data splitting; develop RL algorithm for personalized bidding.

Result: Achieves near-optimal regret bound of O~(dH²√T); validated through simulation experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively captures complex ad effects and enables efficient personalized bidding strategies with theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Online advertising platforms use automated auctions to connect advertisers
with potential customers, requiring effective bidding strategies to maximize
profits. Accurate ad impact estimation requires considering three key factors:
delayed and long-term effects, cumulative ad impacts such as reinforcement or
fatigue, and customer heterogeneity. However, these effects are often not
jointly addressed in previous studies. To capture these factors, we model ad
bidding as a Contextual Markov Decision Process (CMDP) with delayed Poisson
rewards. For efficient estimation, we propose a two-stage maximum likelihood
estimator combined with data-splitting strategies, ensuring controlled
estimation error based on the first-stage estimator's (in)accuracy. Building on
this, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm to derive efficient
personalized bidding strategies. This approach achieves a near-optimal regret
bound of $\tilde{O}{(dH^2\sqrt{T})}$, where $d$ is the contextual dimension,
$H$ is the number of rounds, and $T$ is the number of customers. Our
theoretical findings are validated by simulation experiments.

TL;DR: Online draft model selection algorithm for speculative decoding that competes with the best draft model in hindsight, improving exponentially over bandit-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accelerate LLM inference through better draft model selection in speculative decoding, addressing limitations of existing approaches.

Method: Designs an algorithm that evaluates all draft models without additional target model queries, applicable to all speculative decoding methods (single draft, multi-drafts, draft-trees) with system-efficient implementations.

Result: Substantially outperforms state-of-the-art EAGLE3 and BanditSpec baselines, especially in domains with specialized drafters and long reasoning chains.

Conclusion: The proposed online draft model selection approach provides significant improvements in speculative decoding performance across diverse domains and model types.

Abstract: Speculative decoding is widely used in accelerating large language model
(LLM) inference. In this work, we focus on the online draft model selection
problem in speculative decoding. We design an algorithm that provably competes
with the best draft model in hindsight for each query in terms of either the
token acceptance probability or expected acceptance length. In particular, we
show that we can accurately evaluate all draft models, instead of only the
chosen model without incurring additional queries to the target model, which
allows us to improve exponentially over the existing bandit-based approach as
the number of draft models increases. Our approach is generically applicable
with any speculative decoding methods (single draft, multi-drafts and
draft-trees). Moreover, we design system-efficient versions of online learners
and demonstrate that the overhead in computation and latency can be
substantially reduced. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source LLMs and
diverse datasets, demonstrating that our methods substantially outperform the
state-of-the-art EAGLE3 and the BanditSpec baseline in a variety of domains
where specialized domain-expert drafters are available, especially when long
reasoning chains are required.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how liquidity and volatility proxies from core cryptoassets generate spillovers that forecast market-wide risk using a multi-layer statistical framework and machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether liquidity and volatility measures from key cryptoassets can predict broader market risk through spillover effects.

Method: Three-layer statistical framework: (A) core liquidity-return interactions, (B) principal-component relations, (C) volatility-factor projections. Complemented by VAR impulse responses, HAR-X models, and leakage-safe machine learning with temporal splits and SHAP interpretation.

Result: Found statistically significant Granger-causal relationships across layers and moderate out-of-sample predictive accuracy using 2021-2025 daily data from 74 cryptoassets.

Conclusion: Liquidity and volatility proxies from core cryptoassets do generate spillovers that can forecast market-wide risk, with documented statistical significance and predictive value.

Abstract: We study whether liquidity and volatility proxies of a core set of
cryptoassets generate spillovers that forecast market-wide risk. Our empirical
framework integrates three statistical layers: (A) interactions between core
liquidity and returns, (B) principal-component relations linking liquidity and
returns, and (C) volatility-factor projections that capture cross-sectional
volatility crowding. The analysis is complemented by vector autoregression
impulse responses and forecast error variance decompositions (see Granger 1969;
Sims 1980), heterogeneous autoregressive models with exogenous regressors
(HAR-X, Corsi 2009), and a leakage-safe machine learning protocol using
temporal splits, early stopping, validation-only thresholding, and SHAP-based
interpretation. Using daily data from 2021 to 2025 (1462 observations across 74
assets), we document statistically significant Granger-causal relationships
across layers and moderate out-of-sample predictive accuracy. We report the
most informative figures, including the pipeline overview, Layer A heatmap,
Layer C robustness analysis, vector autoregression variance decompositions, and
the test-set precision-recall curve. Full data and figure outputs are provided

Method: Uses transformer encoders/decoders to model long-range neural dynamics and explicitly partitions latent space into orthogonal shared and private subspaces.

Result: CTAE extracts meaningful representations that better decode behavioral variables compared to existing approaches on motor and sensory area recordings.

Conclusion: CTAE successfully addresses non-stationary dynamics and shared/private signal separation in a unified framework for multi-region neural data analysis.

Abstract: Simultaneous recordings from thousands of neurons across multiple brain areas
reveal rich mixtures of activity that are shared between regions and dynamics
that are unique to each region. Existing alignment or multi-view methods
neglect temporal structure, whereas dynamical latent variable models capture
temporal dependencies but are usually restricted to a single area, assume
linear read-outs, or conflate shared and private signals. We introduce the
Coupled Transformer Autoencoder (CTAE) - a sequence model that addresses both
(i) non-stationary, non-linear dynamics and (ii) separation of shared versus
region-specific structure in a single framework. CTAE employs transformer
encoders and decoders to capture long-range neural dynamics and explicitly
partitions each region's latent space into orthogonal shared and private
subspaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CTAE on two high-density
electrophysiology datasets with simultaneous recordings from multiple regions,
one from motor cortical areas and the other from sensory areas. CTAE extracts
meaningful representations that better decode behavioral variables compared to
existing approaches.

### [155] [ShapeX: Shapelet-Driven Post Hoc Explanations for Time Series Classification Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20084)
*Bosong Huang,Ming Jin,Yuxuan Liang,Johan Barthelemy,Debo Cheng,Qingsong Wen,Chenghao Liu,Shirui Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ShapeX is a framework that explains time series classification models by identifying key shapelets (subsequences) using Shapley values, improving explanation precision and causal fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing post-hoc time series explanation methods focus on timestep-level attribution but overlook that classification outcomes are primarily driven by key shapelets, which is crucial for transparency in high-stakes applications.

Method: ShapeX segments time series into shapelet-driven segments using the Shapelet Describe-and-Detect (SDD) framework to learn diverse shapelets, then applies Shapley values to assess their saliency.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show ShapeX outperforms existing methods in identifying relevant subsequences, enhancing both precision and causal fidelity of explanations.

Conclusion: ShapeX provides more accurate and causally meaningful explanations for time series classification by focusing on shapelets rather than timestep-level features.

Abstract: Explaining time series classification models is crucial, particularly in
high-stakes applications such as healthcare and finance, where transparency and
trust play a critical role. Although numerous time series classification
methods have identified key subsequences, known as shapelets, as core features
for achieving state-of-the-art performance and validating their pivotal role in
classification outcomes, existing post-hoc time series explanation (PHTSE)
methods primarily focus on timestep-level feature attribution. These
explanation methods overlook the fundamental prior that classification outcomes
are predominantly driven by key shapelets. To bridge this gap, we present
ShapeX, an innovative framework that segments time series into meaningful
shapelet-driven segments and employs Shapley values to assess their saliency.
At the core of ShapeX lies the Shapelet Describe-and-Detect (SDD) framework,
which effectively learns a diverse set of shapelets essential for
classification. We further demonstrate that ShapeX produces explanations which
reveal causal relationships instead of just correlations, owing to the
atomicity properties of shapelets. Experimental results on both synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that ShapeX outperforms existing methods in
identifying the most relevant subsequences, enhancing both the precision and
causal fidelity of time series explanations.

### [156] [Hierarchical Dual-Head Model for Suicide Risk Assessment via MentalRoBERTa](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20085)
*Chang Yang,Ziyi Wang,Wangfeng Tan,Zhiting Tan,Changrui Ji,Zhiming Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a hierarchical dual-head neural network based on MentalRoBERTa for suicide risk classification with four levels, using CORAL head for ordinal relationships and classification head for categorical distinctions, with combined loss function and temporal modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social media platforms are important for suicide risk detection but face challenges including class imbalance, temporal complexity in posting patterns, and dual nature of risk levels as both ordinal and categorical.

Method: Hierarchical dual-head neural network with MentalRoBERTa backbone, CORAL head for ordinal relationships, classification head for categorical distinctions, 3-layer Transformer encoder with time interval embeddings, combined loss function (CORAL + Cross-Entropy + Focal Loss), frozen layers and mixed-precision training.

Result: Evaluated using 5-fold stratified cross-validation with macro F1 score as primary metric (specific results not provided in abstract).

Conclusion: The proposed model addresses multiple challenges in suicide risk classification by combining ordinal and categorical approaches with temporal modeling and balanced loss functions.

Abstract: Social media platforms have become important sources for identifying suicide
risk, but automated detection systems face multiple challenges including severe
class imbalance, temporal complexity in posting patterns, and the dual nature
of risk levels as both ordinal and categorical. This paper proposes a
hierarchical dual-head neural network based on MentalRoBERTa for suicide risk
classification into four levels: indicator, ideation, behavior, and attempt.
The model employs two complementary prediction heads operating on a shared
sequence representation: a CORAL (Consistent Rank Logits) head that preserves
ordinal relationships between risk levels, and a standard classification head
that enables flexible categorical distinctions. A 3-layer Transformer encoder
with 8-head multi-head attention models temporal dependencies across post
sequences, while explicit time interval embeddings capture posting behavior
dynamics. The model is trained with a combined loss function (0.5 CORAL + 0.3
Cross-Entropy + 0.2 Focal Loss) that simultaneously addresses ordinal structure
preservation, overconfidence reduction, and class imbalance. To improve
computational efficiency, we freeze the first 6 layers (50%) of MentalRoBERTa
and employ mixed-precision training. The model is evaluated using 5-fold
stratified cross-validation with macro F1 score as the primary metric.

### [157] [Competition is the key: A Game Theoretic Causal Discovery Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20106)
*Amartya Roy,Souvik Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A game-theoretic RL framework for causal discovery that combines empirical performance with theoretical guarantees by competing against strong baselines like GES and GraN-DAG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between empirically strong but theoretically unproven causal discovery methods and theoretically principled but unscalable approaches.

Method: DDQN agent that directly competes against strong baselines (GES or GraN-DAG), always warm-starting from the opponent's solution.

Result: Achieves provable guarantees: never worse than opponent, accelerated convergence, and high probability of selecting true best graph. Scales to large graphs (up to 220 nodes) and improves upon baselines on real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: Establishes a new class of RL-based causal discovery algorithms that are simultaneously provably consistent, sample-efficient, and practically scalable.

Abstract: Causal discovery remains a central challenge in machine learning, yet
existing methods face a fundamental gap: algorithms like GES and GraN-DAG
achieve strong empirical performance but lack finite-sample guarantees, while
theoretically principled approaches fail to scale. We close this gap by
introducing a game-theoretic reinforcement learning framework for causal
discovery, where a DDQN agent directly competes against a strong baseline (GES
or GraN-DAG), always warm-starting from the opponent's solution. This design
yields three provable guarantees: the learned graph is never worse than the
opponent, warm-starting strictly accelerates convergence, and most importantly,
with high probability the algorithm selects the true best candidate graph. To
the best of our knowledge, our result makes a first-of-its-kind progress in
explaining such finite-sample guarantees in causal discovery: on synthetic SEMs
(30 nodes), the observed error probability decays with n, tightly matching
theory. On real-world benchmarks including Sachs, Asia, Alarm, Child, Hepar2,
Dream, and Andes, our method consistently improves upon GES and GraN-DAG while
remaining theoretically safe. Remarkably, it scales to large graphs such as
Hepar2 (70 nodes), Dream (100 nodes), and Andes (220 nodes). Together, these
results establish a new class of RL-based causal discovery algorithms that are
simultaneously provably consistent, sample-efficient, and practically scalable,
marking a decisive step toward unifying empirical performance with rigorous
finite-sample theory.

### [158] [On pattern classification with weighted dimensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20107)
*Ayatullah Faruk Mollah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel weighted dimension-based distance measure and weighting scheme for KNN classifier that improves classification accuracy, especially for high-dimensional datasets like gene expression data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Euclidean distance in pattern classification has limitations, and there's a need for better distance measures that account for dimensional importance and similarity between samples.

Method: Developed a novel weighting scheme for each dimension, incorporated it into KNN classifier with weighted Minkowski distance, and tested on synthetic and realistic datasets.

Result: Significant improvement in classification accuracy (around 10% gain) for gene expression datasets across all cross-validation experiments with different k values, outperforming traditional KNN.

Conclusion: The proposed method is an important generalization of KNN classifier that effectively handles high-dimensional data by regulating the shape and size of neighborhood regions through appropriate weighting and distance norms.

Abstract: Studies on various facets of pattern classification is often imperative while
working with multi-dimensional samples pertaining to diverse application
scenarios. In this notion, weighted dimension-based distance measure has been
one of the vital considerations in pattern analysis as it reflects the degree
of similarity between samples. Though it is often presumed to be settled with
the pervasive use of Euclidean distance, plethora of issues often surface. In
this paper, we present (a) a detail analysis on the impact of distance measure
norms and weights of dimensions along with visualization, (b) a novel weighting
scheme for each dimension, (c) incorporation of this dimensional weighting
schema into a KNN classifier, and (d) pattern classification on a variety of
synthetic as well as realistic datasets with the developed model. It has
performed well across diverse experiments in comparison to the traditional KNN
under the same experimental setups. Specifically, for gene expression datasets,
it yields significant and consistent gain in classification accuracy (around
10%) in all cross-validation experiments with different values of k. As such
datasets contain limited number of samples of high dimensions, meaningful
selection of nearest neighbours is desirable, and this requirement is
reasonably met by regulating the shape and size of the region enclosing the k
number of reference samples with the developed weighting schema and appropriate
norm. It, therefore, stands as an important generalization of KNN classifier
powered by weighted Minkowski distance with the present weighting schema.

### [159] [Why Prototypes Collapse: Diagnosing and Preventing Partial Collapse in Prototypical Self-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20108)
*Gabriel Y. Arteaga,Marius Aasan,Rwiddhi Chakraborty,Martine Hjelkrem-Tan,Thalles Silva,Michael Kampffmeyer,Adín Ramírez Rivera*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses prototype collapse in self-supervised learning by proposing a decoupled training strategy that separates prototype learning from encoder optimization using an online EM-style procedure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-supervised learning methods suffer from partial prototype collapse where multiple prototypes converge to similar representations, undermining their purpose of providing diverse targets. Current solutions like over-parameterization or regularization only treat symptoms rather than addressing the root cause.

Method: Introduces a fully decoupled training strategy that learns prototypes and encoders under separate objectives. Prototypes are modeled as a Gaussian mixture updated with an online EM-style procedure independent of the encoder's loss, breaking the joint optimization that causes collapse.

Result: The decoupling eliminates prototype collapse without explicit regularization, yielding consistently diverse prototypes and stronger downstream performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Decoupling prototype learning from encoder optimization through principled separation of objectives effectively addresses the root cause of prototype collapse, providing a simple yet effective solution that improves representation diversity and downstream task performance.

Abstract: Prototypical self-supervised learning methods consistently suffer from
partial prototype collapse, where multiple prototypes converge to nearly
identical representations. This undermines their central purpose -- providing
diverse and informative targets to guide encoders toward rich representations
-- and has led practitioners to over-parameterize prototype sets or add ad-hoc
regularizers, which mitigate symptoms rather than address the root cause. We
empirically trace the collapse to the joint optimization of encoders and
prototypes, which encourages a type of shortcut learning: early in training
prototypes drift toward redundant representations that minimize loss without
necessarily enhancing representation diversity. To break the joint
optimization, we introduce a fully decoupled training strategy that learns
prototypes and encoders under separate objectives. Concretely, we model
prototypes as a Gaussian mixture updated with an online EM-style procedure,
independent of the encoder's loss. This simple yet principled decoupling
eliminates prototype collapse without explicit regularization and yields
consistently diverse prototypes and stronger downstream performance.

### [160] [There is No "apple" in Timeseries: Rethinking TSFM through the Lens of Invariance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20119)
*Arian Prabowo,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Timeseries foundation models underperform because they naively copy NLP/CV approaches, but timeseries lacks web-scale concept-rich data like 'apple' datasets. Progress requires principled dataset design that systematically covers temporal invariances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current timeseries foundation models fail to outperform simple baselines due to inappropriate importation of NLP/CV pipelines, which don't work because timeseries data lacks the dense concept representation found in web-scale text/image corpora.

Method: Proposes shifting from opportunistic data aggregation to principled dataset construction that systematically spans the space of temporal invariances, building ontologies based on first principles to ensure representational completeness.

Result: Identifies the fundamental limitation in timeseries foundation models and provides a conceptual framework for improvement, though no empirical results are presented in this abstract.

Conclusion: Timeseries foundation models can only achieve true generalization, reasoning, and emergent behavior through systematic coverage of temporal invariances in dataset design, moving beyond the failed scrape-everything paradigm.

Abstract: Timeseries foundation models (TSFMs) have multiplied, yet lightweight
supervised baselines and even classical models often match them. We argue this
gap stems from the naive importation of NLP or CV pipelines. In language and
vision, large web-scale corpora densely capture human concepts i.e. there are
countless images and text of apples. In contrast, timeseries data is built to
complement the image and text modalities. There are no timeseries dataset that
contains the concept apple. As a result, the scrape-everything-online paradigm
fails for TS. We posit that progress demands a shift from opportunistic
aggregation to principled design: constructing datasets that systematically
span the space of invariance that preserve temporal semantics. To this end, we
suggest that the ontology of timeseries invariances should be built based on
first principles. Only by ensuring representational completeness through
invariance coverage can TSFMs achieve the aligned structure necessary for
generalisation, reasoning, and truly emergent behaviour.

### [161] [Understanding Mechanistic Role of Structural and Functional Connectivity in Tau Propagation Through Multi-Layer Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20148)
*Tingting Dan,Xinwei Huang,Jiaqi Ding,Yinggang Zheng,Guorong Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study reveals how structural and functional connectivity asymmetrically drive tau propagation in Alzheimer's disease, with FC dominating early stages and SC becoming primary later, and these patterns align with AD-associated gene expression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) interact to influence tau protein propagation in Alzheimer's disease, as emerging evidence shows tau builds up along specific brain networks but the SC-FC interaction mechanisms remain unclear.

Method: Used a multi-layer graph diffusion model to analyze an unprecedented volume of longitudinal neuroimaging data, examining SC-FC interactions in tau propagation across brain regions.

Result: Found regionally asymmetric contributions: FC predominantly drives tau spread in subcortical areas, insula, frontal and temporal cortices, while SC plays larger role in occipital, parietal, and limbic regions. The SC-FC dominance shifts over disease course, with FC prevailing in early AD and SC becoming primary in later stages. These patterns align with regional expression of AD-associated genes (CHUK, TMEM106B, MCL1, NOTCH1, TH).

Conclusion: Structural and functional connectivity asymmetrically constrain tau propagation in Alzheimer's disease, with their relative dominance shifting over disease progression and aligning with genetic risk factors, providing insights into network-based mechanisms of AD pathology.

Abstract: Emerging neuroimaging evidence shows that pathological tau proteins build up
along specific brain networks, suggesting that large-scale network architecture
plays a key role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, how
structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) interact to
influence tau propagation remains unclear. Leveraging an unprecedented volume
of longitudinal neuroimaging data, we examine SC-FC interactions through a
multi-layer graph diffusion model. Beyond showing that connectome architecture
constrains tau spread, our model reveals a regionally asymmetric contribution
of SC and FC. Specifically, FC predominantly drives tau spread in subcortical
areas, the insula, frontal and temporal cortices, whereas SC plays a larger
role in occipital, parietal, and limbic regions. The relative dominance of SC
versus FC shifts over the course of disease, with FC generally prevailing in
early AD and SC becoming primary in later stages. Spatial patterns of SC- and
FC-dominant regions strongly align with the regional expression of
AD-associated genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and lysosomal
function, including CHUK (IKK-alpha), TMEM106B, MCL1, NOTCH1, and TH. In
parallel, other non-modifiable risk factors (e.g., APOE genotype, sex) and
biological mechanisms (e.g., amyloid deposition) selectively reshape tau
propagation by shifting dominant routes between anatomical and functional
pathways in a region-specific manner. Findings are validated in an independent
AD cohort.

*Xiaoming Wu,Teng Liu,Xin Wang,Ming Yang,Jiguo Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADP-VRSGP is a decentralized learning method with adaptive differential privacy that dynamically adjusts noise variance and learning rate, improving training efficiency and model performance while providing node-level privacy guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed-variance noise in existing differential privacy approaches degrades model performance and reduces training efficiency in decentralized learning.

Method: Uses adaptive differential privacy with variance-reduced stochastic gradient push, dynamic noise variance and learning rate adjustment via stepwise-decaying schedule, progressive gradient fusion strategy leveraging historical gradients, and decentralized push-sum aggregation for time-varying topologies.

Result: Achieves robust convergence with appropriate learning rate, significantly improves training stability and speed, and outperforms existing baselines across multiple scenarios.

Conclusion: ADP-VRSGP effectively addresses privacy-preserving decentralized learning challenges by balancing privacy protection with model performance through adaptive mechanisms.

Abstract: Differential privacy is widely employed in decentralized learning to
safeguard sensitive data by introducing noise into model updates. However,
existing approaches that use fixed-variance noise often degrade model
performance and reduce training efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel approach called decentralized learning with adaptive
differential privacy via variance-reduced stochastic gradient push (ADP-VRSGP).
This method dynamically adjusts both the noise variance and the learning rate
using a stepwise-decaying schedule, which accelerates training and enhances
final model performance while providing node-level personalized privacy
guarantees. To counteract the slowed convergence caused by large-variance noise
in early iterations, we introduce a progressive gradient fusion strategy that
leverages historical gradients. Furthermore, ADP-VRSGP incorporates
decentralized push-sum and aggregation techniques, making it particularly
suitable for time-varying communication topologies. Through rigorous
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that ADP-VRSGP achieves robust convergence
with an appropriate learning rate, significantly improving training stability
and speed. Experimental results validate that our method outperforms existing
baselines across multiple scenarios, highlighting its efficacy in addressing
the challenges of privacy-preserving decentralized learning.

*Tongkai Lu,Shuai Ma,Chongyang Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HyperNS method uses hyper tour guided neighborhood search with clustering-first strategy to solve large-scale TSP instances more efficiently than existing neural methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in scaling neural methods to larger TSP instances, including memory constraints with global heatmaps and insufficient global guidance for navigating large search spaces.

Method: Divides TSP into clusters using sparse heatmap graph, abstracts clusters as supernodes, generates hyper tour to guide initialization and optimization, focusing on relevant edges to reduce search space.

Result: Outperforms existing neural-based methods on synthetic and real-world datasets, especially for larger-scale instances, with significant reduction in gap to optimal solution.

Conclusion: HyperNS provides an effective approach for large-scale TSP by combining clustering strategy with hyper tour guidance, enabling more efficient optimization and better solution quality.

Abstract: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard problem that has
garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. While
neural-based methods have shown promise for solving TSPs, they still face
challenges in scaling to larger instances, particularly in memory constraints
associated with global heatmaps, edge weights, or access matrices, as well as
in generating high-quality initial solutions and insufficient global guidance
for efficiently navigating vast search spaces. To address these challenges, we
propose a Hyper Tour Guided Neighborhood Search (HyperNS) method for
large-scale TSP instances. Inspired by the ``clustering first, route second"
strategy, our approach initially divides the TSP instance into clusters using a
sparse heatmap graph and abstracts them as supernodes, followed by the
generation of a hyper tour to guide both the initialization and optimization
processes. This method reduces the search space by focusing on edges relevant
to the hyper tour, leading to more efficient and effective optimization.
Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that
our approach outperforms existing neural-based methods, particularly in
handling larger-scale instances, offering a significant reduction in the gap to
the optimal solution.

*Shumin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study evaluates cancer risk classification in dogs using routine lab data from the Golden Retriever Lifetime Study, finding that while machine learning models can detect a cancer signal (AUROC=0.815), the performance is insufficient for reliable clinical use due to poor classification metrics and confounding with normal aging/inflammation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop accessible, low-cost cancer screening tools for dogs using routine laboratory data, addressing challenges of non-specific biomarkers and severe class imbalance in screening populations.

Method: Comprehensive benchmark evaluation of 126 analytical pipelines combining machine learning models, feature selection methods, and data balancing techniques on the GRLS cohort, with patient-level data partitioning to prevent leakage.

Result: Optimal model (Logistic Regression with class weighting and recursive feature elimination) showed moderate ranking ability (AUROC=0.815) but poor clinical performance (F1-score=0.25, PPV=0.15). High NPV (0.98) but insufficient recall (0.79) for reliable rule-out testing. SHAP analysis revealed predictions driven by non-specific features like age and inflammation markers.

Conclusion: Routine lab data contains a statistically detectable but clinically unreliable cancer signal that is too weak and confounded with normal aging/inflammation. Multi-modal data integration is needed for meaningful progress in computational veterinary oncology.

Abstract: The development of accessible screening tools for early cancer detection in
dogs represents a significant challenge in veterinary medicine. Routine
laboratory data offer a promising, low-cost source for such tools, but their
utility is hampered by the non-specificity of individual biomarkers and the
severe class imbalance inherent in screening populations. This study assesses
the feasibility of cancer risk classification using the Golden Retriever
Lifetime Study (GRLS) cohort under real-world constraints, including the
grouping of diverse cancer types and the inclusion of post-diagnosis samples. A
comprehensive benchmark evaluation was conducted, systematically comparing 126
analytical pipelines that comprised various machine learning models, feature
selection methods, and data balancing techniques. Data were partitioned at the
patient level to prevent leakage. The optimal model, a Logistic Regression
classifier with class weighting and recursive feature elimination, demonstrated
moderate ranking ability (AUROC = 0.815; 95% CI: 0.793-0.836) but poor clinical
classification performance (F1-score = 0.25, Positive Predictive Value = 0.15).
While a high Negative Predictive Value (0.98) was achieved, insufficient recall
(0.79) precludes its use as a reliable rule-out test. Interpretability analysis
with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) revealed that predictions were driven
by non-specific features like age and markers of inflammation and anemia. It is
concluded that while a statistically detectable cancer signal exists in routine
lab data, it is too weak and confounded for clinically reliable discrimination
from normal aging or other inflammatory conditions. This work establishes a
critical performance ceiling for this data modality in isolation and
underscores that meaningful progress in computational veterinary oncology will
require integration of multi-modal data sources.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLEV extends RLVR by incorporating human value signals into reward functions, enabling LLMs to optimize for both correctness and task importance, resulting in value-sensitive termination policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR focuses only on binary correctness rewards but overlooks that tasks have different importance levels. RLEV aims to align LLM optimization with quantifiable human value signals to prioritize high-value tasks.

Method: Extends RLVR framework by incorporating human-defined value signals directly into reward function using exam-style data with explicit ground-truth value labels. Uses value-weighted gradient amplification on end-of-sequence tokens.

Result: Consistently outperforms correctness-only baselines across multiple RL algorithms and model scales. Learns value-sensitive termination policy: concise for low-value prompts, thorough for high-value ones. Robust under noisy value signals like difficulty-based labels.

Conclusion: Optimizing for explicit utility functions offers practical path to aligning LLMs with human priorities through value-weighted reward signals.

Abstract: We propose Reinforcement Learning with Explicit Human Values (RLEV), a method
that aligns Large Language Model (LLM) optimization directly with quantifiable
human value signals. While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) effectively trains models in objective domains using binary correctness
rewards, it overlooks that not all tasks are equally significant. RLEV extends
this framework by incorporating human-defined value signals directly into the
reward function. Using exam-style data with explicit ground-truth value labels,
RLEV consistently outperforms correctness-only baselines across multiple RL
algorithms and model scales. Crucially, RLEV policies not only improve
value-weighted accuracy but also learn a value-sensitive termination policy:
concise for low-value prompts, thorough for high-value ones. We demonstrate
this behavior stems from value-weighted gradient amplification on
end-of-sequence tokens. Ablation studies confirm the gain is causally linked to
value alignment. RLEV remains robust under noisy value signals, such as
difficulty-based labels, demonstrating that optimizing for an explicit utility
function offers a practical path to aligning LLMs with human priorities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Category information is crucial for capturing inherent patterns in real-world time series forecasting tasks, but traditional attention mechanisms don't explicitly leverage categorical data.

Method: Proposes QKCV (Query-Key-Category-Value) attention that adds a static categorical embedding C to the standard QKV framework, serving as a plug-in module for attention-based models.

Result: Improves forecasting accuracy across various attention-based models (Transformer, Informer, PatchTST, TFT) on diverse datasets and enables efficient fine-tuning of univariate time series foundation models by only updating the static embedding C.

Conclusion: QKCV attention effectively leverages category information to enhance forecasting performance while providing computational efficiency through selective parameter updates during fine-tuning.

Abstract: In real-world time series forecasting tasks, category information plays a
pivotal role in capturing inherent data patterns. This paper introduces QKCV
(Query-Key-Category-Value) attention, an extension of the traditional QKV
framework that incorporates a static categorical embedding C to emphasize
category-specific information. As a versatile plug-in module, QKCV enhances the
forecasting accuracy of attention-based models (e.g., Vanilla Transformer,
Informer, PatchTST, TFT) across diverse real-world datasets. Furthermore, QKCV
demonstrates remarkable adaptability in fine-tuning univariate time series
foundation model by solely updating the static embedding C while preserving
pretrained weights, thereby reducing computational overhead and achieving
superior fine-tuning performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for risk-aware constrained reinforcement learning using optimized certainty equivalents to address tail risks and ensure per-stage robustness in reward values and time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard constrained RL focuses on expected accumulated rewards but neglects catastrophic tail events, which is insufficient for high-stakes applications where risk in outliers is critical.

Method: Proposes a risk-aware constrained RL framework using optimized certainty equivalents (OCEs) with strong Lagrangian duality, which can be wrapped around standard RL solvers like PPO.

Result: The framework ensures exact equivalence to the original constrained problem under appropriate constraint qualifications and demonstrates risk-aware properties through numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a practical and theoretically sound method for risk-aware constrained RL with proven convergence and verified risk-aware properties.

Abstract: Constrained optimization provides a common framework for dealing with
conflicting objectives in reinforcement learning (RL). In most of these
settings, the objectives (and constraints) are expressed though the expected
accumulated reward. However, this formulation neglects risky or even possibly
catastrophic events at the tails of the reward distribution, and is often
insufficient for high-stakes applications in which the risk involved in
outliers is critical. In this work, we propose a framework for risk-aware
constrained RL, which exhibits per-stage robustness properties jointly in
reward values and time using optimized certainty equivalents (OCEs). Our
framework ensures an exact equivalent to the original constrained problem
within a parameterized strong Lagrangian duality framework under appropriate
constraint qualifications, and yields a simple algorithmic recipe which can be
wrapped around standard RL solvers, such as PPO. Lastly, we establish the
convergence of the proposed algorithm under common assumptions, and verify the
risk-aware properties of our approach through several numerical experiments.

TL;DR: MetaVD is a Bayesian meta-learning approach that uses a hypernetwork to predict client-dependent dropout rates, addressing model overfitting and divergent local models in federated learning with limited non-IID data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional FL faces challenges with model overfitting and divergent local models due to limited and non-IID data among clients, which MetaVD aims to solve.

Method: MetaVD learns client-dependent dropout rates via a shared hypernetwork, enabling model personalization in FL. It emphasizes posterior adaptation through meta-learning and posterior aggregation via Bayesian FL with conditional dropout posterior.

Result: Extensive experiments on sparse and non-IID FL datasets show MetaVD achieves excellent classification accuracy and uncertainty calibration, especially for OOD clients, while compressing local model parameters and reducing communication costs.

Conclusion: MetaVD effectively addresses FL challenges by combining Bayesian meta-learning with personalized dropout rates, improving performance in non-IID settings while reducing overfitting and communication overhead.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aims to train a global inference model from remotely
distributed clients, gaining popularity due to its benefit of improving data
privacy. However, traditional FL often faces challenges in practical
applications, including model overfitting and divergent local models due to
limited and non-IID data among clients. To address these issues, we introduce a
novel Bayesian meta-learning approach called meta-variational dropout (MetaVD).
MetaVD learns to predict client-dependent dropout rates via a shared
hypernetwork, enabling effective model personalization of FL algorithms in
limited non-IID data settings. We also emphasize the posterior adaptation view
of meta-learning and the posterior aggregation view of Bayesian FL via the
conditional dropout posterior. We conducted extensive experiments on various
sparse and non-IID FL datasets. MetaVD demonstrated excellent classification
accuracy and uncertainty calibration performance, especially for
out-of-distribution (OOD) clients. MetaVD compresses the local model parameters
needed for each client, mitigating model overfitting and reducing communication
costs. Code is available at https://github.com/insujeon/MetaVD.

### [169] [Approximate Replicability in Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20200)
*Max Hopkins,Russell Impagliazzo,Christopher Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes three relaxations of replicability in PAC learning to overcome strong impossibility results, showing sample-optimal agnostic PAC learners for each relaxation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Strong impossibility results show that full replicability is too restrictive for basic learning tasks like threshold learning, motivating the search for approximate notions of replicability that enable learning.

Method: Three relaxations: (1) Pointwise replicability (consistent on fixed inputs), (2) Approximate replicability (consistent on most of distribution), (3) Semi-replicability (fully replicable with shared unlabeled samples).

Result: For constant replicability parameters, sample-optimal agnostic PAC learners: (1) and (2) require Θ(d/α²) samples, (3) requires Θ(d²/α²) labeled samples.

Conclusion: Relaxed notions of replicability enable learning where full replicability fails, with different sample complexities depending on the relaxation type.

Abstract: Replicability, introduced by (Impagliazzo et al. STOC '22), is the notion
that algorithms should remain stable under a resampling of their inputs (given
access to shared randomness). While a strong and interesting notion of
stability, the cost of replicability can be prohibitive: there is no replicable
algorithm, for instance, for tasks as simple as threshold learning (Bun et al.
STOC '23). Given such strong impossibility results we ask: under what
approximate notions of replicability is learning possible?
  In this work, we propose three natural relaxations of replicability in the
context of PAC learning: (1) Pointwise: the learner must be consistent on any
fixed input, but not across all inputs simultaneously, (2) Approximate: the
learner must output hypotheses that classify most of the distribution
consistently, (3) Semi: the algorithm is fully replicable, but may additionally
use shared unlabeled samples. In all three cases, for constant replicability
parameters, we obtain sample-optimal agnostic PAC learners: (1) and (2) are
achievable for ``free" using $\Theta(d/\alpha^2)$ samples, while (3) requires
$\Theta(d^2/\alpha^2)$ labeled samples.

*Woohyeon Byeon,Giseung Park,Jongseong Chae,Amir Leshem,Youngchul Sung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A provably convergent framework for max-min multi-objective RL using game theory and mirror descent with adaptive regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a practical and theoretically sound approach for multi-objective reinforcement learning with max-min criterion that ensures convergence.

Method: Reformulate max-min MORL as a two-player zero-sum regularized continuous game and use mirror descent algorithm with adaptive regularization.

Result: The algorithm achieves global last-iterate convergence, with theoretical guarantees on iteration and sample complexity, and outperforms previous baselines in experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a convergent and efficient solution for max-min multi-objective reinforcement learning with strong theoretical foundations and practical performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a provably convergent and practical framework for
multi-objective reinforcement learning with max-min criterion. From a
game-theoretic perspective, we reformulate max-min multi-objective
reinforcement learning as a two-player zero-sum regularized continuous game and
introduce an efficient algorithm based on mirror descent. Our approach
simplifies the policy update while ensuring global last-iterate convergence. We
provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis on our algorithm, including
iteration complexity under both exact and approximate policy evaluations, as
well as sample complexity bounds. To further enhance performance, we modify the
proposed algorithm with adaptive regularization. Our experiments demonstrate
the convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm in tabular settings, and our
implementation for deep reinforcement learning significantly outperforms
previous baselines in many MORL environments.

### [171] [CO-PFL: Contribution-Oriented Personalized Federated Learning for Heterogeneous Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20219)
*Ke Xing,Yanjie Dong,Xiaoyi Fan,Runhao Zeng,Victor C. M. Leung,M. Jamal Deen,Xiping Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CO-PFL is a personalized federated learning algorithm that dynamically estimates client contributions using dual-subspace analysis of gradient directions and prediction deviations, providing principled aggregation weights to mitigate bias and enhance personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional federated learning with single consensus models and heuristic aggregation methods fails under data heterogeneity, leading to suboptimal personalization and aggregation bias due to equal-contribution assumptions.

Method: CO-PFL performs joint assessment using gradient direction discrepancies and prediction deviations from both gradient and data subspaces, integrates parameter-wise personalization with mask-aware momentum optimization for stable updates.

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR10C, CINIC10, and Mini-ImageNet show CO-PFL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in personalization accuracy, robustness, scalability and convergence stability.

Conclusion: CO-PFL effectively mitigates aggregation bias, strengthens global coordination, and enhances local performance by constructing tailored submodels with stable updates through principled contribution estimation.

Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) addresses a critical challenge of
collaboratively training customized models for clients with heterogeneous and
scarce local data. Conventional federated learning, which relies on a single
consensus model, proves inadequate under such data heterogeneity. Its standard
aggregation method of weighting client updates heuristically or by data volume,
operates under an equal-contribution assumption, failing to account for the
actual utility and reliability of each client's update. This often results in
suboptimal personalization and aggregation bias. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce Contribution-Oriented PFL (CO-PFL), a novel algorithm that
dynamically estimates each client's contribution for global aggregation. CO-PFL
performs a joint assessment by analyzing both gradient direction discrepancies
and prediction deviations, leveraging information from gradient and data
subspaces. This dual-subspace analysis provides a principled and discriminative
aggregation weight for each client, emphasizing high-quality updates.
Furthermore, to bolster personalization adaptability and optimization
stability, CO-PFL cohesively integrates a parameter-wise personalization
mechanism with mask-aware momentum optimization. Our approach effectively
mitigates aggregation bias, strengthens global coordination, and enhances local
performance by facilitating the construction of tailored submodels with stable
updates. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR10C,
CINIC10, and Mini-ImageNet) confirm that CO-PFL consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in in personalization accuracy, robustness,
scalability and convergence stability.

### [172] [What Does It Take to Build a Performant Selective Classifier?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20242)
*Stephan Rabanser,Nicolas Papernot*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper formalizes the selective-classification gap and decomposes it into five error sources, revealing that monotone calibration has limited impact and that effective score reordering is needed to bridge the gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why selective classifiers fall short of perfect-oracle performance and identify actionable ways to improve them.

Method: Finite-sample decomposition of the selective-classification gap into five components: Bayes noise, approximation error, ranking error, statistical noise, and implementation/shift-induced slack. Validation on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Result: Bayes noise and limited model capacity account for substantial gaps; only feature-aware calibrators meaningfully improve score ordering; data shift introduces separate slack requiring robust training.

Conclusion: The decomposition provides a quantitative error budget and design guidelines for building selective classifiers that better approximate ideal oracle behavior.

Abstract: Selective classifiers improve model reliability by abstaining on inputs the
model deems uncertain. However, few practical approaches achieve the
gold-standard performance of a perfect-ordering oracle that accepts examples
exactly in order of correctness. Our work formalizes this shortfall as the
selective-classification gap and present the first finite-sample decomposition
of this gap to five distinct sources of looseness: Bayes noise, approximation
error, ranking error, statistical noise, and implementation- or shift-induced
slack. Crucially, our analysis reveals that monotone post-hoc calibration --
often believed to strengthen selective classifiers -- has limited impact on
closing this gap, since it rarely alters the model's underlying score ranking.
Bridging the gap therefore requires scoring mechanisms that can effectively
reorder predictions rather than merely rescale them. We validate our
decomposition on synthetic two-moons data and on real-world vision and language
benchmarks, isolating each error component through controlled experiments. Our
results confirm that (i) Bayes noise and limited model capacity can account for
substantial gaps, (ii) only richer, feature-aware calibrators meaningfully
improve score ordering, and (iii) data shift introduces a separate slack that
demands distributionally robust training. Together, our decomposition yields a
quantitative error budget as well as actionable design guidelines that
practitioners can use to build selective classifiers which approximate ideal
oracle behavior more closely.

### [173] [Alternatives to the Laplacian for Scalable Spectral Clustering with Group Fairness Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20220)
*Iván Ojeda-Ruiz,Young Ju-Lee,Malcolm Dickens,Leonardo Cambisaca*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Fair-SMW, an efficient spectral clustering algorithm that incorporates group fairness constraints using Lagrangian methods and Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury identity, achieving 2x faster computation and 2x better balance than state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spectral clustering algorithms with fairness constraints suffer from computational inefficiency when incorporating group fairness (balance) metrics, requiring improved runtime performance while maintaining equitable outcomes.

Method: Reformulated constrained optimization problem using Lagrangian method and Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury identity to create Fair-SMW algorithm with three Laplacian matrix alternatives, evaluated on real-world datasets using Stochastic Block Model.

Result: Fair-SMW achieved 2x faster computation time and 2x better balance compared to state-of-the-art methods across LastFM, FacebookNet, Deezer, and German datasets.

Conclusion: The Fair-SMW algorithm successfully addresses computational efficiency challenges in fair spectral clustering while maintaining or improving fairness outcomes, demonstrating practical viability for real-world applications.

Abstract: Recent research has focused on mitigating algorithmic bias in clustering by
incorporating fairness constraints into algorithmic design. Notions such as
disparate impact, community cohesion, and cost per population have been
implemented to enforce equitable outcomes. Among these, group fairness
(balance) ensures that each protected group is proportionally represented
within every cluster. However, incorporating balance as a metric of fairness
into spectral clustering algorithms has led to computational times that can be
improved. This study aims to enhance the efficiency of spectral clustering
algorithms by reformulating the constrained optimization problem using a new
formulation derived from the Lagrangian method and the
Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury (SMW) identity, resulting in the Fair-SMW algorithm.
Fair-SMW employs three alternatives to the Laplacian matrix with different
spectral gaps to generate multiple variations of Fair-SMW, achieving clustering
solutions with comparable balance to existing algorithms while offering
improved runtime performance. We present the results of Fair-SMW, evaluated
using the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) to measure both runtime efficiency and
balance across real-world network datasets, including LastFM, FacebookNet,
Deezer, and German. We achieve an improvement in computation time that is twice
as fast as the state-of-the-art, and also flexible enough to achieve twice as
much balance.

*Tristan Cinquin,Geoff Pleiss,Agustinus Kristiadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRM-guided tree search for mathematical reasoning shows no significant improvement over Best-of-N selection despite higher costs, due to unreliable PRM scores that degrade with reasoning depth and poor out-of-distribution generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-thought prompting with Best-of-N selection has limitations in capturing the branching and exploratory nature of complex mathematical problem-solving, prompting investigation of PRM-guided tree search methods.

Method: Proposed adaptive algorithm to maximize process reward model (PRM) scores over intractable action space, and investigated PRM-guided tree search methods including Monte Carlo tree search and beam search across 23 mathematical problems using Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct.

Result: PRM-guided tree search showed no statistically significant improvements over BoN despite higher costs; Monte Carlo tree search and beam search outperformed other methods; PRMs poorly approximate state values and reliability degrades with reasoning depth; PRMs generalize poorly out of distribution.

Conclusion: Tree search's underperformance stems from greater reliance on unreliable PRM scores, suggesting different reward modeling is necessary before tree search can effectively enhance mathematical reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: While chain-of-thought prompting with Best-of-N (BoN) selection has become
popular for mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs), its linear
structure fails to capture the branching and exploratory nature of complex
problem-solving. In this work, we propose an adaptive algorithm to maximize
process reward model (PRM) scores over the intractable action space, and
investigate whether PRM-guided tree search can improve mathematical reasoning
by exploring multiple partial solution paths. Across $23$ diverse mathematical
problems using Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct with its associated PRM as a case
study, we find that: (1) PRM-guided tree search shows no statistically
significant improvements over BoN despite higher costs, (2) Monte Carlo tree
search and beam search outperform other PRM-guided tree search methods, (3)
PRMs poorly approximate state values and their reliability degrades with
reasoning depth, and (4) PRMs generalize poorly out of distribution. This
underperformance stems from tree search's greater reliance on unreliable PRM
scores, suggesting different reward modeling is necessary before tree search
can effectively enhance mathematical reasoning in LLMs.

Motivation: To improve downscaling accuracy of weather variables beyond existing methods like interpolation baselines and CorrDiff, enabling more precise weather predictions from sparse station data.

Method: Train a model using sparse weather station data and topography information over Japan to generate implicit neural representations that support arbitrary downscaling of weather variables.

Result: The model achieves up to 50% better performance than both CorrDiff and interpolation baseline for temperature downscaling, and 10-20% better for wind downscaling, evaluated both in-distribution and out-of-distribution.

Conclusion: SpLIIF demonstrates superior downscaling capabilities for weather variables compared to existing methods, particularly showing significant improvements for temperature prediction.

Abstract: We introduce SpLIIF to generate implicit neural representations and enable
arbitrary downscaling of weather variables. We train a model from sparse
weather stations and topography over Japan and evaluate in- and
out-of-distribution accuracy predicting temperature and wind, comparing it to
both an interpolation baseline and CorrDiff. We find the model to be up to 50%
better than both CorrDiff and the baseline at downscaling temperature, and
around 10-20% better for wind.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposed DB-FGA-Net: a double-backbone network combining VGG16 and Xception with Frequency-Gated Attention Block for brain tumor classification without data augmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance with interpretable Grad-CAM visualization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for brain tumor classification rely heavily on data augmentation, limiting generalization and trust in clinical applications. Need for robust, augmentation-free models with better interpretability.

Method: Double-backbone network integrating VGG16 and Xception architectures with Frequency-Gated Attention Block to capture complementary local and global features. Uses Grad-CAM for tumor region visualization and includes GUI for real-time classification.

Result: Achieved 99.24% accuracy on 7K-DS dataset (4-class), 98.68% (3-class), 99.85% (2-class). Generalizes to independent 3K-DS dataset with 95.77% accuracy, outperforming baseline and state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DB-FGA-Net demonstrates strong potential for reliable clinical translation in brain tumor diagnosis through augmentation-free, interpretable, and deployable deep learning approach.

Abstract: Brain tumors are a challenging problem in neuro-oncology, where early and
precise diagnosis is important for successful treatment. Deep learning-based
brain tumor classification methods often rely on heavy data augmentation which
can limit generalization and trust in clinical applications. In this paper, we
propose a double-backbone network integrating VGG16 and Xception with a
Frequency-Gated Attention (FGA) Block to capture complementary local and global
features. Unlike previous studies, our model achieves state-of-the-art
performance without augmentation which demonstrates robustness to variably
sized and distributed datasets. For further transparency, Grad-CAM is
integrated to visualize the tumor regions based on which the model is giving
prediction, bridging the gap between model prediction and clinical
interpretability. The proposed framework achieves 99.24\% accuracy on the 7K-DS
dataset for the 4-class setting, along with 98.68\% and 99.85\% in the 3-class
and 2-class settings, respectively. On the independent 3K-DS dataset, the model
generalizes with 95.77\% accuracy, outperforming baseline and state-of-the-art
methods. To further support clinical usability, we developed a graphical user
interface (GUI) that provides real-time classification and Grad-CAM-based tumor
localization. These findings suggest that augmentation-free, interpretable, and
deployable deep learning models such as DB-FGA-Net hold strong potential for
reliable clinical translation in brain tumor diagnosis.

*Teng Jiek See,Daokun Zhang,Mario Boley,David K. Chalmers*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LKM is a self-knowledge distillation method that improves GNN accuracy for molecular property prediction without adding computational cost by minimizing distance between hidden embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need to improve GNN accuracy for molecular property prediction without increasing computational complexity and memory requirements.

Method: Layer-to-Layer Knowledge Mixing (LKM) minimizes mean absolute distance between pre-existing hidden embeddings of GNN layers to aggregate multi-hop and multi-scale information.

Result: Reduces mean absolute error by up to 9.8% (QM9), 45.3% (MD17 Energy), and 22.9% (Chignolin) across three GNN architectures.

Conclusion: LKM significantly improves GNN accuracy for chemical property prediction without substantial increase in training and inference cost.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the currently most effective methods for
predicting molecular properties but there remains a need for more accurate
models. GNN accuracy can be improved by increasing the model complexity but
this also increases the computational cost and memory requirement during
training and inference. In this study, we develop Layer-to-Layer Knowledge
Mixing (LKM), a novel self-knowledge distillation method that increases the
accuracy of state-of-the-art GNNs while adding negligible computational
complexity during training and inference. By minimizing the mean absolute
distance between pre-existing hidden embeddings of GNN layers, LKM efficiently
aggregates multi-hop and multi-scale information, enabling improved
representation of both local and global molecular features. We evaluated LKM
using three diverse GNN architectures (DimeNet++, MXMNet, and PAMNet) using
datasets of quantum chemical properties (QM9, MD17 and Chignolin). We found
that the LKM method effectively reduces the mean absolute error of quantum
chemical and biophysical property predictions by up to 9.8% (QM9), 45.3% (MD17
Energy), and 22.9% (Chignolin). This work demonstrates the potential of LKM to
significantly improve the accuracy of GNNs for chemical property prediction
without any substantial increase in training and inference cost.

*Fengyuan Yu,Yuyuan Li,Xiaohua Feng,Junjie Fang,Tao Wang,Chaochao Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LEGO is a lightweight framework for multiple-attribute unlearning in recommender systems that addresses dynamic privacy protection needs through embedding calibration and flexible combination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-attribute unlearning methods cannot handle real-world requirements involving multiple sensitive attributes and dynamic unlearning needs, due to inability to handle simultaneous requests and lack of adaptability.

Method: Two-step framework: 1) Embedding Calibration removes attribute-specific information from user embeddings, 2) Flexible Combination merges these embeddings to protect all sensitive attributes. Framed as mutual information minimization problem.

Result: Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets across three recommendation models demonstrate effectiveness and efficiency of the framework.

Conclusion: LEGO provides a theoretically-guaranteed solution for simultaneous multiple-attribute unlearning with efficient adaptability to dynamic privacy protection requirements.

Abstract: With the growing demand for safeguarding sensitive user information in
recommender systems, recommendation attribute unlearning is receiving
increasing attention. Existing studies predominantly focus on single-attribute
unlearning. However, privacy protection requirements in the real world often
involve multiple sensitive attributes and are dynamic. Existing
single-attribute unlearning methods cannot meet these real-world requirements
due to i) CH1: the inability to handle multiple unlearning requests
simultaneously, and ii) CH2: the lack of efficient adaptability to dynamic
unlearning needs. To address these challenges, we propose LEGO, a lightweight
and efficient multiple-attribute unlearning framework. Specifically, we divide
the multiple-attribute unlearning process into two steps: i) Embedding
Calibration removes information related to a specific attribute from user
embedding, and ii) Flexible Combination combines these embeddings into a single
embedding, protecting all sensitive attributes. We frame the unlearning process
as a mutual information minimization problem, providing LEGO a theoretical
guarantee of simultaneous unlearning, thereby addressing CH1. With the two-step
framework, where Embedding Calibration can be performed in parallel and
Flexible Combination is flexible and efficient, we address CH2. Extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets across three representative
recommendation models demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our
proposed framework. Our code and appendix are available at

*Baoqing Yue,Jinyuan Zhou,Zixi Wei,Jingtao Zhan,Qingyao Ai,Yiqun Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Relative-Based Probability (RBP) metric and scaling law to complement cross-entropy by focusing on relative token ordering, demonstrating robustness across datasets and model families.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-entropy provides only a partial view of model performance as it ignores relative ordering between correct and incorrect tokens, which is crucial for language models in scenarios like greedy sampling.

Method: Proposed Relative-Based Probability (RBP) metric to quantify probability that correct token ranks among top predictions, then established Relative-Based Scaling Law through experiments on four datasets and four model families spanning five orders of magnitude.

Result: Demonstrated robustness and accuracy of the Relative-Based Scaling Law across extensive experiments, showing it can explain emergence phenomena and help find fundamental scaling law theories.

Conclusion: The Relative-Based Scaling Law complements cross-entropy perspective and contributes to more complete understanding of scaling large language models, offering valuable insights for both practical development and theoretical exploration.

Abstract: Scaling laws aim to accurately predict model performance across different
scales. Existing scaling-law studies almost exclusively rely on cross-entropy
as the evaluation metric. However, cross-entropy provides only a partial view
of performance: it measures the absolute probability assigned to the correct
token, but ignores the relative ordering between correct and incorrect tokens.
Yet, relative ordering is crucial for language models, such as in
greedy-sampling scenario. To address this limitation, we investigate scaling
from the perspective of relative ordering. We first propose the Relative-Based
Probability (RBP) metric, which quantifies the probability that the correct
token is ranked among the top predictions. Building on this metric, we
establish the Relative-Based Scaling Law, which characterizes how RBP improves
with increasing model size. Through extensive experiments on four datasets and
four model families spanning five orders of magnitude, we demonstrate the
robustness and accuracy of this law. Finally, we illustrate the broad
application of this law with two examples, namely providing a deeper
explanation of emergence phenomena and facilitating finding fundamental
theories of scaling laws. In summary, the Relative-Based Scaling Law
complements the cross-entropy perspective and contributes to a more complete
understanding of scaling large language models. Thus, it offers valuable
insights for both practical development and theoretical exploration.

TL;DR: FedGPS addresses data heterogeneity in Federated Learning by combining statistical distribution and gradient information from other clients to improve model robustness across diverse scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL methods struggle with data heterogeneity and lack robustness across different heterogeneity scenarios. The paper aims to create a more robust solution that performs well under various data distribution conditions.

Method: FedGPS statically modifies each client's learning objective to model global data distribution using surrogate information, while dynamically adjusting local update directions with gradient information from other clients at each round.

Result: Extensive experiments show FedGPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse heterogeneity scenarios, demonstrating superior effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: FedGPS provides a robust solution to data heterogeneity in FL by synergistically integrating statistical and gradient information, achieving better performance across various scenarios compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) confronts a significant challenge known as data
heterogeneity, which impairs model performance and convergence. Existing
methods have made notable progress in addressing this issue. However, improving
performance in certain heterogeneity scenarios remains an overlooked question:
\textit{How robust are these methods to deploy under diverse heterogeneity
scenarios?} To answer this, we conduct comprehensive evaluations across varied
heterogeneity scenarios, showing that most existing methods exhibit limited
robustness. Meanwhile, insights from these experiments highlight that sharing
statistical information can mitigate heterogeneity by enabling clients to
update with a global perspective. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{FedGPS}
(\textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{G}oal-\textbf{P}ath \textbf{S}ynergy), a novel
framework that seamlessly integrates statistical distribution and gradient
information from others. Specifically, FedGPS statically modifies each client's
learning objective to implicitly model the global data distribution using
surrogate information, while dynamically adjusting local update directions with
gradient information from other clients at each round. Extensive experiments
show that FedGPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse
heterogeneity scenarios, validating its effectiveness and robustness. The code

*Tom Maus,Asma Atamna,Tobias Glasmachers*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Enhanced industry-inspired benchmark combining sorting and pressing operations in sequential recycling scenario. Evaluated modular vs monolithic RL control strategies with action masking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of RL in industrial automation including reward design, modularity, and action space management. Create more realistic benchmark that bridges academic research and real-world industrial control problems.

Method: Created sequential recycling benchmark combining SortingEnv and ContainerGym tasks. Evaluated two control strategies: modular architecture with specialized agents and monolithic agent. Analyzed impact of action masking on learning performance.

Result: Without action masking, agents struggled to learn effective policies, with modular architecture performing better. With action masking, both architectures improved substantially and performance gap narrowed significantly.

Conclusion: Action space constraints play decisive role in RL performance. Advantages of specialization diminish as action complexity is reduced. Benchmark provides valuable testbed for practical multi-agent RL solutions in industrial automation.

Abstract: Autonomous control of multi-stage industrial processes requires both local
specialization and global coordination. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a
promising approach, but its industrial adoption remains limited due to
challenges such as reward design, modularity, and action space management. Many
academic benchmarks differ markedly from industrial control problems, limiting
their transferability to real-world applications. This study introduces an
enhanced industry-inspired benchmark environment that combines tasks from two
existing benchmarks, SortingEnv and ContainerGym, into a sequential recycling
scenario with sorting and pressing operations. We evaluate two control
strategies: a modular architecture with specialized agents and a monolithic
agent governing the full system, while also analyzing the impact of action
masking. Our experiments show that without action masking, agents struggle to
learn effective policies, with the modular architecture performing better. When
action masking is applied, both architectures improve substantially, and the
performance gap narrows considerably. These results highlight the decisive role
of action space constraints and suggest that the advantages of specialization
diminish as action complexity is reduced. The proposed benchmark thus provides
a valuable testbed for exploring practical and robust multi-agent RL solutions
in industrial automation, while contributing to the ongoing debate on
centralization versus specialization.

*Thomas Rupf,Marco Bagatella,Marin Vlastelica,Andreas Krause*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OpTI-BFM enables Behavior Foundation Models to infer tasks through environment interaction at test-time, reducing the need for pre-computed reward data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current BFMs require computing rewards over inference datasets, needing either functional reward forms or significant labeling efforts, which is inefficient.

Method: Proposes OpTI-BFM, an optimistic decision criterion that models uncertainty over reward functions and guides BFMs in data collection for task inference.

Result: Provides formal regret bound and shows successor-features-based BFMs can identify and optimize unseen reward functions in few episodes with minimal compute overhead.

Conclusion: OpTI-BFM enables efficient task inference through interaction, reducing data requirements while maintaining performance in zero-shot RL settings.

Abstract: Behavior Foundation Models (BFMs) are capable of retrieving high-performing
policy for any reward function specified directly at test-time, commonly
referred to as zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL). While this is a very
efficient process in terms of compute, it can be less so in terms of data: as a
standard assumption, BFMs require computing rewards over a non-negligible
inference dataset, assuming either access to a functional form of rewards, or
significant labeling efforts. To alleviate these limitations, we tackle the
problem of task inference purely through interaction with the environment at
test-time. We propose OpTI-BFM, an optimistic decision criterion that directly
models uncertainty over reward functions and guides BFMs in data collection for
task inference. Formally, we provide a regret bound for well-trained BFMs
through a direct connection to upper-confidence algorithms for linear bandits.
Empirically, we evaluate OpTI-BFM on established zero-shot benchmarks, and
observe that it enables successor-features-based BFMs to identify and optimize
an unseen reward function in a handful of episodes with minimal compute

### [183] [ImpossibleBench: Measuring LLMs' Propensity of Exploiting Test Cases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20270)
*Ziqian Zhong,Aditi Raghunathan,Nicholas Carlini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ImpossibleBench is a benchmark framework that measures LLM agents' tendency to exploit shortcuts by creating impossible tasks with conflicts between specifications and unit tests, quantifying cheating rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often find and exploit shortcuts to complete tasks, which undermines benchmark validity and real-world reliability. For example, an LLM might delete failing tests instead of fixing bugs.

Method: Create impossible variants of existing benchmarks by introducing direct conflicts between natural-language specifications and unit tests. Measure cheating rate as pass rate on these impossible tasks where passing requires specification-violating shortcuts.

Result: The framework reveals fine-grained cheating behaviors from simple test modification to complex operator overloading, and shows how prompt engineering, test access, and feedback loops affect cheating rates.

Conclusion: ImpossibleBench serves as a versatile tool for studying model behaviors, context engineering, and developing monitoring tools to build more robust and reliable LLM systems.

Abstract: The tendency to find and exploit "shortcuts" to complete tasks poses
significant risks for reliable assessment and deployment of large language
models (LLMs). For example, an LLM agent with access to unit tests may delete
failing tests rather than fix the underlying bug. Such behavior undermines both
the validity of benchmark results and the reliability of real-world LLM coding
assistant deployments.
  To quantify, study, and mitigate such behavior, we introduce ImpossibleBench,
a benchmark framework that systematically measures LLM agents' propensity to
exploit test cases. ImpossibleBench creates "impossible" variants of tasks from
existing benchmarks like LiveCodeBench and SWE-bench by introducing direct
conflicts between the natural-language specification and the unit tests. We
measure an agent's "cheating rate" as its pass rate on these impossible tasks,
where any pass necessarily implies a specification-violating shortcut.
  As a practical framework, ImpossibleBench is not just an evaluation but a
versatile tool. We demonstrate its utility for: (1) studying model behaviors,
revealing more fine-grained details of cheating behaviors from simple test
modification to complex operator overloading; (2) context engineering, showing
how prompt, test access and feedback loop affect cheating rates; and (3)
developing monitoring tools, providing a testbed with verified deceptive
solutions. We hope ImpossibleBench serves as a useful framework for building
more robust and reliable LLM systems.

*Xuan Lin,Aocheng Ding,Tengfei Ma,Hua Liang,Zhe Quan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MolBridge is an atom-level joint graph refinement framework for drug-drug interaction prediction that models fine-grained inter-drug relationships through joint graph construction and structure consistency modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DDI prediction methods fail to capture atom-level cross-molecular interactions and struggle with diverse molecular complexities and DDI type distributions, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Constructs joint graphs integrating atomic structures of drug pairs, uses structure consistency module to iteratively refine node features while preserving global structural context, enabling learning of both local and global interaction patterns.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieves superior performance across long-tail and inductive scenarios, and demonstrates robust performance across both frequent and rare DDI types on two benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Fine-grained graph refinement improves accuracy, robustness, and mechanistic interpretability of DDI event prediction, contributing to graph-based methods for mining drug-drug interaction networks.

Abstract: Drug combinations offer therapeutic benefits but also carry the risk of
adverse drug-drug interactions (DDIs), especially under complex molecular
structures. Accurate DDI event prediction requires capturing fine-grained
inter-drug relationships, which are critical for modeling metabolic mechanisms
such as enzyme-mediated competition. However, existing approaches typically
rely on isolated drug representations and fail to explicitly model atom-level
cross-molecular interactions, limiting their effectiveness across diverse
molecular complexities and DDI type distributions. To address these
limitations, we propose MolBridge, a novel atom-level joint graph refinement
framework for robust DDI event prediction. MolBridge constructs a joint graph
that integrates atomic structures of drug pairs, enabling direct modeling of
inter-drug associations. A central challenge in such joint graph settings is
the potential loss of information caused by over-smoothing when modeling
long-range atomic dependencies. To overcome this, we introduce a structure
consistency module that iteratively refines node features while preserving the
global structural context. This joint design allows MolBridge to effectively
learn both local and global interaction outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving superior performance across long-tail and inductive scenarios.
patterns, yielding robust representations across both frequent and rare DDI
types. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that MolBridge
consistently. These results demonstrate the advantages of fine-grained graph
refinement in improving the accuracy, robustness, and mechanistic
interpretability of DDI event prediction.This work contributes to Web Mining
and Content Analysis by developing graph-based methods for mining and analyzing
drug-drug interaction networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Topological features capture global geometric structure in imaging data but need computational efficiency and differentiability for practical deep learning adoption.

Method: Developed CUDA kernels optimized for Ampere GPUs using 128B-coalesced access and hierarchical shared-memory accumulation, plus a differentiable PyTorch layer with sigmoid relaxation.

Result: Achieved 16-2000x speedups over prior GPU implementations on synthetic grids and enabled end-to-end learning through differentiable implementation.

Conclusion: The work enables broader adoption of topological features in deep learning through computational efficiency and differentiability, with potential for batching and multi-GPU extensions.

Abstract: Topological features capture global geometric structure in imaging data, but
practical adoption in deep learning requires both computational efficiency and
differentiability. We present optimized GPU kernels for the Euler
Characteristic Curve (ECC) computation achieving 16-2000\"O speedups over prior
GPU implementations on synthetic grids, and introduce a differentiable PyTorch
layer enabling end-to-end learning. Our CUDA kernels, optimized for Ampere GPUs
use 128B-coalesced access and hierarchical shared-memory accumulation. Our
PyTorch layer learns thresholds in a single direction via a Differentiable
Euler Characteristic Transform-style sigmoid relaxation. We discuss downstream
relevance, including applications highlighted by prior ECC work, and outline
batching/multi-GPU extensions to broaden adoption.

*Tomáš Souček,Sylvestre-Alvise Rebuffi,Pierre Fernandez,Nikola Jovanović,Hady Elsahar,Valeriu Lacatusu,Tuan Tran,Alexandre Mourachko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates watermark forging attacks on post-hoc image watermarking systems, introducing a method to remove and forge watermarks without knowledge of the watermarking model using only a single watermarked image.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of AI-generated content and legal requirements for content attribution, watermarking has become crucial. However, watermark forging (stealing watermarks from genuine content and applying them to malicious content) remains underexplored despite extensive research on removal attacks.

Method: The authors introduce a preference model trained with ranking loss on procedurally generated images to detect watermarks. They then use this model to remove and forge watermarks through backpropagation optimization, requiring only one watermarked image and no knowledge of the watermarking model.

Result: The proposed method effectively forges watermarks across various post-hoc image watermarking models, demonstrating that current watermarking approaches may not be secure against such attacks.

Conclusion: The research questions the security of existing watermarking methods by showing that watermark forging is practical and simpler than previously thought, potentially undermining content authenticity and attribution systems.

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in interest in digital content watermarking
techniques, driven by the proliferation of generative models and increased
legal pressure. With an ever-growing percentage of AI-generated content
available online, watermarking plays an increasingly important role in ensuring
content authenticity and attribution at scale. There have been many works
assessing the robustness of watermarking to removal attacks, yet, watermark
forging, the scenario when a watermark is stolen from genuine content and
applied to malicious content, remains underexplored. In this work, we
investigate watermark forging in the context of widely used post-hoc image
watermarking. Our contributions are as follows. First, we introduce a
preference model to assess whether an image is watermarked. The model is
trained using a ranking loss on purely procedurally generated images without
any need for real watermarks. Second, we demonstrate the model's capability to
remove and forge watermarks by optimizing the input image through
backpropagation. This technique requires only a single watermarked image and
works without knowledge of the watermarking model, making our attack much
simpler and more practical than attacks introduced in related work. Third, we
evaluate our proposed method on a variety of post-hoc image watermarking
models, demonstrating that our approach can effectively forge watermarks,
questioning the security of current watermarking approaches. Our code and
further resources are publicly available.

*Fangjian Zhang,Xiaoyong Zhuge,Wenlan Wang,Haixia Xiao,Yuying Zhu,Siyang Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Hurdle-IMDL framework to address imbalanced label distribution in rainfall retrieval, decomposing imbalance into zero inflation and long tail problems, achieving superior performance especially for heavy rain events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI effectiveness in quantitative remote sensing is constrained by imbalanced label distribution, which causes models to favor common samples and degrade performance for rare ones like heavy rainfall.

Method: Hurdle-IMDL framework decomposes imbalance into zero inflation (predominance of non-rain samples) and long tail (disproportionate abundance of light vs heavy rain). Uses hurdle model for zero inflation and IMDL for long tail by transforming learning object into unbiased ideal inverse model.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation shows Hurdle-IMDL's superiority over conventional, cost-sensitive, generative, and multi-task learning methods. Key advancements include effective mitigation of systematic underestimation and marked improvement in heavy-to-extreme rain retrieval.

Conclusion: IMDL offers a generalizable approach for addressing imbalance in environmental variable distributions, enabling enhanced retrieval of rare yet high-impact events.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced quantitative remote sensing, yet its
effectiveness is constrained by imbalanced label distribution. This imbalance
leads conventionally trained models to favor common samples, which in turn
degrades retrieval performance for rare ones. Rainfall retrieval exemplifies
this issue, with performance particularly compromised for heavy rain. This
study proposes Hurdle-Inversion Model Debiasing Learning (IMDL) framework.
Following a divide-and-conquer strategy, imbalance in the rain distribution is
decomposed into two components: zero inflation, defined by the predominance of
non-rain samples; and long tail, defined by the disproportionate abundance of
light-rain samples relative to heavy-rain samples. A hurdle model is adopted to
handle the zero inflation, while IMDL is proposed to address the long tail by
transforming the learning object into an unbiased ideal inverse model.
Comprehensive evaluation via statistical metrics and case studies investigating
rainy weather in eastern China confirms Hurdle-IMDL's superiority over
conventional, cost-sensitive, generative, and multi-task learning methods. Its
key advancements include effective mitigation of systematic underestimation and
a marked improvement in the retrieval of heavy-to-extreme rain. IMDL offers a
generalizable approach for addressing imbalance in distributions of
environmental variables, enabling enhanced retrieval of rare yet high-impact
events.

*Qitai Tan,Yiyun Chen,Mo Li,Ruiwen Gu,Yilin Su,Xiao-Ping Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SynTSBench is a synthetic data-driven evaluation framework that systematically assesses time series forecasting models through programmable feature configuration, enabling interpretable analysis of model capabilities across temporal patterns, robustness to data irregularities, and comparison with theoretical optima.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models struggle with robust performance in real-world applications despite strong benchmark results, due to black-box architectures and limited evaluation frameworks that lack quantitative insights into specific model strengths and weaknesses.

Method: Proposes SynTSBench framework with three analytical dimensions: temporal feature decomposition and capability mapping, robustness analysis under data irregularities, and theoretical optimum benchmarking to establish performance boundaries for each pattern type.

Result: Experiments show that current deep learning models do not universally approach optimal baselines across all types of temporal features, revealing gaps in model capabilities.

Conclusion: SynTSBench provides an interpretable evaluation system that enables systematic assessment of fundamental modeling capabilities, helping address the gap between benchmark performance and real-world robustness in time series forecasting.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have driven rapid progress in time series
forecasting, yet many state-of-the-art models continue to struggle with robust
performance in real-world applications, even when they achieve strong results
on standard benchmark datasets. This persistent gap can be attributed to the
black-box nature of deep learning architectures and the inherent limitations of
current evaluation frameworks, which frequently lack the capacity to provide
clear, quantitative insights into the specific strengths and weaknesses of
different models, thereby complicating the selection of appropriate models for
particular forecasting scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a
synthetic data-driven evaluation paradigm, SynTSBench, that systematically
assesses fundamental modeling capabilities of time series forecasting models
through programmable feature configuration. Our framework isolates confounding
factors and establishes an interpretable evaluation system with three core
analytical dimensions: (1) temporal feature decomposition and capability
mapping, which enables systematic evaluation of model capacities to learn
specific pattern types; (2) robustness analysis under data irregularities,
which quantifies noise tolerance thresholds and anomaly recovery capabilities;
and (3) theoretical optimum benchmarking, which establishes performance
boundaries for each pattern type-enabling direct comparison between model
predictions and mathematical optima. Our experiments show that current deep
learning models do not universally approach optimal baselines across all types
of temporal features.The code is available at

TL;DR: Proposes KAN-based Collaborative Model (KCM) to improve large-small model collaboration by addressing accuracy degradation, catastrophic forgetting, and hallucination issues while maintaining performance with reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large-small model collaboration frameworks suffer from significant accuracy degradation, exacerbated catastrophic forgetting, and amplified hallucination problems induced by small model knowledge, despite aiming to reduce computational costs and enhance specialized domain performance.

Method: Uses KAN (Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks) as an alternative neural network architecture instead of conventional MLPs, deployed in large-small collaborative systems across language, vision, and vision-language cross-modal tasks.

Result: KCM significantly reduces large model inference calls while maintaining near-identical task accuracy, substantially lowering computational resource consumption. It markedly mitigates catastrophic forgetting and improves accuracy for long-tail data, outperforming MLP-based collaborative models across all metrics.

Conclusion: KAN-based collaborative models provide superior performance over MLP-based approaches in large-small model collaboration, offering better interpretability, reduced catastrophic forgetting, and efficient computational resource utilization while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: In recent years, Pretrained Large Models(PLMs) researchers proposed
large-small model collaboration frameworks, leveraged easily trainable small
models to assist large models, aim to(1) significantly reduce computational
resource consumption while maintaining comparable accuracy, and (2) enhance
large model performance in specialized domain tasks. However, this
collaborative paradigm suffers from issues such as significant accuracy
degradation, exacerbated catastrophic forgetting, and amplified hallucination
problems induced by small model knowledge. To address these challenges, we
propose a KAN-based Collaborative Model (KCM) as an improved approach to
large-small model collaboration. The KAN utilized in KCM represents an
alternative neural network architecture distinct from conventional MLPs.
Compared to MLPs, KAN offers superior visualizability and interpretability
while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. We deployed KCM in large-small model
collaborative systems across three scenarios: language, vision, and
vision-language cross-modal tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that,
compared with pure large model approaches, the large-small model collaboration
framework utilizing KCM as the collaborative model significantly reduces the
number of large model inference calls while maintaining near-identical task
accuracy, thereby substantially lowering computational resource consumption.
Concurrently, the KAN-based small collaborative model markedly mitigates
catastrophic forgetting, leading to significant accuracy improvements for
long-tail data. The results reveal that KCM demonstrates superior performance
across all metrics compared to MLP-based small collaborative models (MCM).

Motivation: To build AI collaborators that assist throughout the entire scientific research process, requiring end-to-end evaluation benchmarks rather than isolated sub-tasks.

Method: Created CS-54k corpus through scalable pipeline combining retrieval-augmented generation with multi-stage quality control. Derived CS-4k benchmark and CS-50k training dataset from this corpus.

Result: CS-4k stratifies state-of-the-art LLMs into distinct capability tiers. Open models trained on CS-50k show substantial improvements, with 7B-scale models outperforming larger proprietary systems like GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.5 Pro.

Conclusion: Making AI better research assistants relies more on domain-aligned training with high-quality data than on pretraining scale or general benchmark performance.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, the ultimate vision for their role
in science is emerging: we could build an AI collaborator to effectively assist
human beings throughout the entire scientific research process. We refer to
this envisioned system as ResearchGPT. Given that scientific research
progresses through multiple interdependent phases, achieving this vision
requires rigorous benchmarks that evaluate the end-to-end workflow rather than
isolated sub-tasks. To this end, we contribute CS-54k, a high-quality corpus of
scientific Q&A pairs in computer science, built from 14k CC-licensed papers. It
is constructed through a scalable, paper-grounded pipeline that combines
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with multi-stage quality control to ensure
factual grounding. From this unified corpus, we derive two complementary
subsets: CS-4k, a carefully curated benchmark for evaluating AI's ability to
assist scientific research, and CS-50k, a large-scale training dataset.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CS-4k stratifies state-of-the-art LLMs
into distinct capability tiers. Open models trained on CS-50k with supervised
training and reinforcement learning demonstrate substantial improvements. Even
7B-scale models, when properly trained, outperform many larger proprietary
systems, such as GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. This indicates that
making AI models better research assistants relies more on domain-aligned
training with high-quality data than on pretraining scale or general benchmark
performance. We release CS-4k and CS-50k in the hope of fostering AI systems as
reliable collaborators in CS research.

TL;DR: This paper systematically analyzes how graph rewiring affects structural properties and performance in GNNs, finding that successful methods preserve local structure while allowing global connectivity changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph rewiring is widely used to address over-squashing in GNNs but alters graph topology, potentially distorting important structural signals. There's limited understanding of which structural properties must be preserved for both performance gains and structural fidelity.

Method: The study analyzes seven diverse rewiring strategies and correlates changes in local and global graph properties with node classification accuracy through systematic analysis of structural metrics.

Result: Results show a consistent pattern: successful rewiring methods preserve local structure while allowing flexibility in global connectivity, revealing the relationship between structural changes and downstream performance.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights for designing effective rewiring strategies that balance structural preservation with performance optimization, bridging graph theory with practical GNN optimization.

Abstract: Graph rewiring has emerged as a key technique to alleviate over-squashing in
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Transformers by modifying the graph
topology to improve information flow. While effective, rewiring inherently
alters the graph's structure, raising the risk of distorting important
topology-dependent signals. Yet, despite the growing use of rewiring, little is
known about which structural properties must be preserved to ensure both
performance gains and structural fidelity. In this work, we provide the first
systematic analysis of how rewiring affects a range of graph structural
metrics, and how these changes relate to downstream task performance. We study
seven diverse rewiring strategies and correlate changes in local and global
graph properties with node classification accuracy. Our results reveal a
consistent pattern: successful rewiring methods tend to preserve local
structure while allowing for flexibility in global connectivity. These findings
offer new insights into the design of effective rewiring strategies, bridging
the gap between graph theory and practical GNN optimization.

TL;DR: Proposes an IRM-free method for causal subgraph discovery in graph neural networks using norm-guided invariant distribution objective, achieving state-of-the-art graph generalization without environment annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for out-of-distribution generalization in graph neural networks rely on costly environment annotations or synthetic data splits. The paper aims to develop an IRM-free approach to overcome these limitations.

Method: Identifies that causal subgraphs have smaller distributional variations across environments (Invariant Distribution Criterion), establishes relationship between distributional shift and representation norm, and proposes norm-guided invariant distribution objective for causal subgraph discovery.

Result: Extensive experiments on two benchmarks show the method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in graph generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed IRM-free method effectively captures causal subgraphs and achieves superior graph generalization without requiring environment annotations or synthetic data splits.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution generalization under distributional shifts remains a
critical challenge for graph neural networks. Existing methods generally adopt
the Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) framework, requiring costly environment
annotations or heuristically generated synthetic splits. To circumvent these
limitations, in this work, we aim to develop an IRM-free method for capturing
causal subgraphs. We first identify that causal subgraphs exhibit substantially
smaller distributional variations than non-causal components across diverse
environments, which we formalize as the Invariant Distribution Criterion and
theoretically prove in this paper. Building on this criterion, we
systematically uncover the quantitative relationship between distributional
shift and representation norm for identifying the causal subgraph, and
investigate its underlying mechanisms in depth. Finally, we propose an IRM-free
method by introducing a norm-guided invariant distribution objective for causal
subgraph discovery and prediction. Extensive experiments on two widely used
benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in graph generalization.

*Yuhang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InvDec is a hybrid architecture for multivariate time series forecasting that combines patch-based temporal encoding with variate-level decoding using delayed embeddings and adaptive fusion, achieving significant improvements on high-dimensional datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either focus on temporal patterns (channel-independent) or cross-variate dependencies (variate-attention) but fail to balance both effectively. Channel-independent methods ignore variable correlations while pure variate-attention approaches sacrifice temporal encoding.

Method: InvDec uses a patch-based temporal encoder combined with an inverted decoder that operates on the variate dimension through variate-wise self-attention. It introduces delayed variate embeddings that enrich variable-specific representations after temporal encoding, and an adaptive residual fusion mechanism to balance temporal and variate information.

Result: Significant improvements on high-dimensional datasets: 20.9% MSE reduction on Electricity (321 variables), 4.3% improvement on Weather, and 2.7% gain on Traffic compared to PatchTST, while maintaining competitive performance on low-dimensional ETT datasets.

Conclusion: InvDec's advantage grows with dataset dimensionality, confirming that cross-variate modeling becomes critical as the number of variables increases. The hybrid approach effectively balances temporal encoding and variate-level decoding for superior multivariate time series forecasting.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting requires simultaneously modeling
temporal patterns and cross-variate dependencies. Channel-independent methods
such as PatchTST excel at temporal modeling but ignore variable correlations,
while pure variate-attention approaches such as iTransformer sacrifice temporal
encoding. We proposeInvDec (Inverted Decoder), a hybrid architecture that
achieves principled separation between temporal encoding and variate-level
decoding. InvDec combines a patch-based temporal encoder with an inverted
decoder operating on the variate dimension through variate-wise self-attention.
We introduce delayed variate embeddings that enrich variable-specific
representations only after temporal encoding, preserving temporal feature
integrity. An adaptive residual fusion mechanism dynamically balances temporal
and variate information across datasets of varying dimensions. Instantiating
InvDec with PatchTST yields InvDec-PatchTST. Extensive experiments on seven
benchmarks demonstrate significant gains on high-dimensional datasets: 20.9%
MSE reduction on Electricity (321 variables), 4.3% improvement on Weather, and
2.7% gain on Traffic compared to PatchTST, while maintaining competitive
performance on low-dimensional ETT datasets. Ablation studies validate each
component, and analysis reveals that InvDec's advantage grows with dataset
dimensionality, confirming that cross-variate modeling becomes critical as the
number of variables increases.

*Alexandru Oarga,Yilun Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel approach for reasoning generalization that learns energy landscapes over subproblem solution spaces and combines them compositionally, outperforming SOTA methods on complex reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing end-to-end reasoning models have limited generalization beyond training distribution. The paper aims to address this by enabling compositional reasoning through energy landscapes.

Method: Learn energy landscapes over subproblem solution spaces, combine them compositionally at test time, and use Parallel Energy Minimization (PEM) for improved sampling.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on reasoning problems, demonstrating better generalization to larger and more complex problems.

Conclusion: The compositional energy landscape approach enables effective reasoning generalization, handling problems more complex than training examples through subproblem composition.

Abstract: Generalization is a key challenge in machine learning, specifically in
reasoning tasks, where models are expected to solve problems more complex than
those encountered during training. Existing approaches typically train
reasoning models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping input instances to
solutions. While this allows models to learn useful heuristics from data, it
often results in limited generalization beyond the training distribution. In
this work, we propose a novel approach to reasoning generalization by learning
energy landscapes over the solution spaces of smaller, more tractable
subproblems. At test time, we construct a global energy landscape for a given
problem by combining the energy functions of multiple subproblems. This
compositional approach enables the incorporation of additional constraints
during inference, allowing the construction of energy landscapes for problems
of increasing difficulty. To improve the sample quality from this newly
constructed energy landscape, we introduce Parallel Energy Minimization (PEM).
We evaluate our approach on a wide set of reasoning problems. Our method
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its ability to
generalize to larger and more complex problems. Project website can be found

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Using flight simulator synthetic images to supplement real data for runway detection in autonomous landing systems, with domain adaptation to handle synthetic-to-real distribution shift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training deep vision models for critical applications like autonomous navigation requires extensive data covering all scenarios, which is costly and difficult to collect. Synthetic data generation offers a cheaper alternative to cover all conditions.

Method: Proposed an image generation approach using commercial flight simulator to complement few annotated real images, with customized domain adaptation strategy to handle synthetic-to-real distribution shift.

Result: Standard object detection models achieved accurate prediction when using combined real and synthetic data. The approach showed robustness to adverse conditions like nighttime images not present in real data.

Conclusion: Synthetic data generation with controlled domain adaptation is effective for runway detection in autonomous landing systems, enabling robust performance even in conditions not covered by real training data.

Abstract: Deep vision models are now mature enough to be integrated in industrial and
possibly critical applications such as autonomous navigation. Yet, data
collection and labeling to train such models requires too much efforts and
costs for a single company or product. This drawback is more significant in
critical applications, where training data must include all possible conditions
including rare scenarios. In this perspective, generating synthetic images is
an appealing solution, since it allows a cheap yet reliable covering of all the
conditions and environments, if the impact of the synthetic-to-real
distribution shift is mitigated. In this article, we consider the case of
runway detection that is a critical part in autonomous landing systems
developed by aircraft manufacturers. We propose an image generation approach
based on a commercial flight simulator that complements a few annotated real
images. By controlling the image generation and the integration of real and
synthetic data, we show that standard object detection models can achieve
accurate prediction. We also evaluate their robustness with respect to adverse
conditions, in our case nighttime images, that were not represented in the real
data, and show the interest of using a customized domain adaptation strategy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide evidence-based recommendations for implementing effective code-oriented RAG systems by systematically comparing retrieval configurations under realistic compute constraints.

Method: Systematic comparison of retrieval configurations across context window sizes using two tasks from Long Code Arena (code completion and bug localization), evaluating chunking strategies, similarity scoring methods, and splitting granularity.

Result: BM25 with word-level splitting is most effective for PL-PL tasks; proprietary dense encoders work best for NL-PL but with 100x latency; optimal chunk size scales with context (32-64 lines for small budgets); line-based chunking matches syntax-aware splitting; retrieval latency varies by 200x across configurations.

Conclusion: BM25 + word splitting offers the best quality-latency trade-off, and evidence-based recommendations are provided for implementing code-oriented RAG systems based on task requirements, model constraints, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: We study retrieval design for code-focused generation tasks under realistic
compute budgets. Using two complementary tasks from Long Code Arena -- code
completion and bug localization -- we systematically compare retrieval
configurations across various context window sizes along three axes: (i)
chunking strategy, (ii) similarity scoring, and (iii) splitting granularity.
(1) For PL-PL, sparse BM25 with word-level splitting is the most effective and
practical, significantly outperforming dense alternatives while being an order
of magnitude faster. (2) For NL-PL, proprietary dense encoders (Voyager-3
family) consistently beat sparse retrievers, however requiring 100x larger
latency. (3) Optimal chunk size scales with available context: 32-64 line
chunks work best at small budgets, and whole-file retrieval becomes competitive
at 16000 tokens. (4) Simple line-based chunking matches syntax-aware splitting
across budgets. (5) Retrieval latency varies by up to 200x across
configurations; BPE-based splitting is needlessly slow, and BM25 + word
splitting offers the best quality-latency trade-off. Thus, we provide
evidence-based recommendations for implementing effective code-oriented RAG
systems based on task requirements, model constraints, and computational
efficiency.

TL;DR: Proposes uncertainty-based routing framework that combines fast reward models with strong but costly LLM judges for efficient RLHF.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical reward models are vulnerable to reward hacking and poor OOD generalization, while LLM judges have superior generalization but high inference costs.

Method: Uses uncertainty quantification in advantage estimation to route uncertain pairs to LLM judges and confident ones to reward models.

Result: Significantly outperforms random judge calling at same cost and improves downstream alignment in online RLHF.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-based routing effectively combines the strengths of both reward models and LLM judges for efficient RLHF.

Abstract: Reward model (RM) plays a pivotal role in reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, classical
RMs trained on human preferences are vulnerable to reward hacking and
generalize poorly to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. By contrast, strong LLM
judges equipped with reasoning capabilities demonstrate superior
generalization, even without additional training, but incur significantly
higher inference costs, limiting their applicability in online RLHF. In this
work, we propose an uncertainty-based routing framework that efficiently
complements a fast RM with a strong but costly LLM judge. Our approach
formulates advantage estimation in policy gradient (PG) methods as pairwise
preference classification, enabling principled uncertainty quantification to
guide routing. Uncertain pairs are forwarded to the LLM judge, while confident
ones are evaluated by the RM. Experiments on RM benchmarks demonstrate that our
uncertainty-based routing strategy significantly outperforms random judge
calling at the same cost, and downstream alignment results showcase its
effectiveness in improving online RLHF.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Breast cancer is the most critical cancer in women worldwide, and conventional diagnostic methods face limitations in variability, cost, and misdiagnosis risk. Machine learning offers potential for improved computer-aided diagnosis.

Method: Integrated framework with customized PSO for feature selection, evaluated on 29 different ML models including classical classifiers, ensembles, neural networks, probabilistic and instance-based algorithms. Uses cross-validation and explainable AI methods for interpretability.

Result: Achieved superior performance of 99.1% across all metrics (accuracy, precision), effectively reduced dimensionality, and provided transparent, model-agnostic explanations.

Conclusion: Combining swarm intelligence with explainable ML shows potential for robust, trustworthy, and clinically meaningful breast cancer diagnosis.

Abstract: Breast cancer is considered the most critical and frequently diagnosed cancer
in women worldwide, leading to an increase in cancer-related mortality. Early
and accurate detection is crucial as it can help mitigate possible threats
while improving survival rates. In terms of prediction, conventional diagnostic
methods are often limited by variability, cost, and, most importantly, risk of
misdiagnosis. To address these challenges, machine learning (ML) has emerged as
a powerful tool for computer-aided diagnosis, with feature selection playing a
vital role in improving model performance and interpretability. This research
study proposes an integrated framework that incorporates customized Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) for feature selection. This framework has been
evaluated on a comprehensive set of 29 different models, spanning classical
classifiers, ensemble techniques, neural networks, probabilistic algorithms,
and instance-based algorithms. To ensure interpretability and clinical
relevance, the study uses cross-validation in conjunction with explainable AI
methods. Experimental evaluation showed that the proposed approach achieved a
superior score of 99.1\% across all performance metrics, including accuracy and
precision, while effectively reducing dimensionality and providing transparent,
model-agnostic explanations. The results highlight the potential of combining
swarm intelligence with explainable ML for robust, trustworthy, and clinically
meaningful breast cancer diagnosis.

*Shuhei Aikawa,Aru Suzuki,Kei Yoshitake,Kanata Teshigawara,Akira Iwabuchi,Ken Kobayashi,Kazuhide Nakata*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a robust optimization framework for hierarchical time-series forecasting that accounts for uncertainty in covariance matrix estimation, improving forecast performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hierarchical forecasting methods require estimating covariance matrices from finite samples, creating a gap between true and estimated matrices that degrades forecast performance.

Method: Introduces uncertainty set for estimated covariance matrix and formulates reconciliation as semidefinite optimization problem minimizing worst-case expected squared error.

Result: Numerical experiments show the robust reconciliation method achieved better forecast performance than existing hierarchical forecasting methods.

Conclusion: Integrating uncertainty into the reconciliation process through robust optimization is effective for improving hierarchical forecasting accuracy.

Abstract: This paper focuses on forecasting hierarchical time-series data, where each
higher-level observation equals the sum of its corresponding lower-level time
series. In such contexts, the forecast values should be coherent, meaning that
the forecast value of each parent series exactly matches the sum of the
forecast values of its child series. Existing hierarchical forecasting methods
typically generate base forecasts independently for each series and then apply
a reconciliation procedure to adjust them so that the resulting forecast values
are coherent across the hierarchy. These methods generally derive an optimal
reconciliation, using a covariance matrix of the forecast error. In practice,
however, the true covariance matrix is unknown and has to be estimated from
finite samples in advance. This gap between the true and estimated covariance
matrix may degrade forecast performance. To address this issue, we propose a
robust optimization framework for hierarchical reconciliation that accounts for
uncertainty in the estimated covariance matrix. We first introduce an
uncertainty set for the estimated covariance matrix and formulate a
reconciliation problem that minimizes the worst-case expected squared error
over this uncertainty set. We show that our problem can be cast as a
semidefinite optimization problem. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the
proposed robust reconciliation method achieved better forecast performance than
existing hierarchical forecasting methods, which indicates the effectiveness of
integrating uncertainty into the reconciliation process.

### [200] [Equitable Survival Prediction: A Fairness-Aware Survival Modeling (FASM) Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20629)
*Mingxuan Liu,Yilin Ning,Haoyuan Wang,Chuan Hong,Matthew Engelhard,Danielle S. Bitterman,William G. La Cava,Nan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FASM is a fairness-aware survival modeling approach that addresses both intra-group and cross-group risk ranking disparities in healthcare machine learning, particularly for breast cancer prognosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models in healthcare can perpetuate structural inequities and social biases from clinical data. Survival analysis adds complexity with censoring and time dynamics, and current fairness approaches often overlook cross-group ranking disparities where high-risk minority patients may be ranked below lower-risk majority patients.

Method: Proposed Fairness-Aware Survival Modeling (FASM) designed to mitigate algorithmic bias in both intra-group and cross-group risk rankings over time. Applied to SEER breast cancer data as a representative case study.

Result: FASM substantially improves fairness while preserving discrimination performance comparable to fairness-unaware survival models. Time-stratified evaluations show stable fairness over 10-year horizon, with greatest improvements during mid-term follow-up.

Conclusion: The approach enables development of survival models that prioritize both accuracy and equity in clinical decision-making, advancing fairness as a core principle in clinical care.

Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly integrated into healthcare,
structural inequities and social biases embedded in clinical data can be
perpetuated or even amplified by data-driven models. In survival analysis,
censoring and time dynamics can further add complexity to fair model
development. Additionally, algorithmic fairness approaches often overlook
disparities in cross-group rankings, e.g., high-risk Black patients may be
ranked below lower-risk White patients who do not experience the event of
mortality. Such misranking can reinforce biological essentialism and undermine
equitable care. We propose a Fairness-Aware Survival Modeling (FASM), designed
to mitigate algorithmic bias regarding both intra-group and cross-group risk
rankings over time. Using breast cancer prognosis as a representative case and
applying FASM to SEER breast cancer data, we show that FASM substantially
improves fairness while preserving discrimination performance comparable to
fairness-unaware survival models. Time-stratified evaluations show that FASM
maintains stable fairness over a 10-year horizon, with the greatest
improvements observed during the mid-term of follow-up. Our approach enables
the development of survival models that prioritize both accuracy and equity in
clinical decision-making, advancing fairness as a core principle in clinical
care.

*Subham Kumar,Prakrithi Shivaprakash,Koustav Rudra,Lekhansh Shukla,Animesh Mukherjee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes GRACE, a graph neural network framework for predicting locus of care for addiction patients, addressing class imbalance through structured learning and unbiased meta-graph generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a critical need for automated locus of care determination due to limited specialized treatment resources, and current approaches suffer from severe class imbalances in addiction datasets.

Method: Uses graph neural networks with extensive feature engineering and proposes a novel approach to obtain unbiased meta-graphs to overcome class imbalance in structured learning.

Result: Experimental results show 11-35% improvement in F1 score for minority class compared to competitive baselines on real-world data.

Conclusion: The GRACE framework effectively addresses class imbalance in addiction care locus prediction through graph neural networks and unbiased meta-graph generation.

Abstract: Determining the appropriate locus of care for addiction patients is one of
the most critical clinical decisions that affects patient treatment outcomes
and effective use of resources. With a lack of sufficient specialized treatment
resources, such as inpatient beds or staff, there is an unmet need to develop
an automated framework for the same. Current decision-making approaches suffer
from severe class imbalances in addiction datasets. To address this limitation,
we propose a novel graph neural network (GRACE) framework that formalizes locus
of care prediction as a structured learning problem. Further, we perform
extensive feature engineering and propose a new approach of obtaining an
unbiased meta-graph to train a GNN to overcome the class imbalance problem.
Experimental results in real-world data show an improvement of 11-35% in terms
of the F1 score of the minority class over competitive baselines. The codes and
note embeddings are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GRACE-F8E1/.

### [202] [Why DPO is a Misspecified Estimator and How to Fix It](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20413)
*Aditya Gopalan,Sayak Ray Chowdhury,Debangshu Banerjee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and shows it suffers from misspecification issues when the true reward function cannot be realized by the policy class, leading to problems like preference reversal. The authors propose AuxDPO, which adds auxiliary variables to DPO to better approximate RLHF solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the limitations of DPO algorithms and address misspecification issues that occur when the true reward function cannot be realized through the parametric policy class, which causes problems like preference order reversal and sensitivity to data distribution.

Method: The authors analyze DPO as a statistical estimation problem over reward functions, study the local behavior of two-stage RLHF, and propose AuxDPO - a modified DPO loss function that introduces auxiliary variables to better approximate RLHF solutions and mitigate misspecification.

Result: Empirical demonstrations show AuxDPO achieves superior performance compared to standard DPO in both didactic bandit settings and LLM alignment tasks, effectively mitigating the misspecification issues.

Conclusion: AuxDPO provides a principled approach to address DPO's misspecification problems by incorporating auxiliary variables that help move towards RLHF solutions, offering improved performance in preference-based alignment tasks.

Abstract: Direct alignment algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
fine-tune models based on preference data, using only supervised learning
instead of two-stage reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). We show
that DPO encodes a statistical estimation problem over reward functions induced
by a parametric policy class. When the true reward function that generates
preferences cannot be realized via the policy class, DPO becomes misspecified,
resulting in failure modes such as preference order reversal, worsening of
policy reward, and high sensitivity to the input preference data distribution.
On the other hand, we study the local behavior of two-stage RLHF for a
parametric class and relate it to a natural gradient step in policy space. Our
fine-grained geometric characterization allows us to propose AuxDPO, which
introduces additional auxiliary variables in the DPO loss function to help move
towards the RLHF solution in a principled manner and mitigate the
misspecification in DPO. We empirically demonstrate the superior performance of
AuxDPO on didactic bandit settings as well as LLM alignment tasks.

*Georgios Mentzelopoulos,Ioannis Asmanis,Konrad P. Kording,Eva L. Dyer,Kostas Daniilidis,Flavia Vitale*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Spikachu is a scalable, causal, and energy-efficient neural decoding framework using spiking neural networks (SNNs) that outperforms causal baselines while consuming 2.26-418.81x less energy, enabling few-shot transfer across sessions, subjects, and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural decoders for brain-computer interfaces either use simple causal models that lack generalization or complex non-causal models that struggle in real-time settings, both relying on power-hungry neural networks that are difficult to integrate into resource-limited systems.

Method: The approach processes binned spikes directly by projecting them into a shared latent space, where spiking modules adapted to input timing extract relevant features; these latent representations are then integrated and decoded to generate behavioral predictions.

Result: Evaluation on 113 recording sessions from 6 non-human primates (43 hours total) shows Spikachu outperforms causal baselines with 2.26-418.81 times less energy consumption, and scaling training to multiple sessions/subjects improves performance and enables few-shot transfer to unseen sessions, subjects, and tasks.

Conclusion: Spikachu introduces a scalable, online-compatible neural decoding framework based on SNNs that achieves competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art models while consuming orders of magnitude less energy.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) promise to enable vital functions, such as
speech and prosthetic control, for individuals with neuromotor impairments.
Central to their success are neural decoders, models that map neural activity
to intended behavior. Current learning-based decoding approaches fall into two
classes: simple, causal models that lack generalization, or complex, non-causal
models that generalize and scale offline but struggle in real-time settings.
Both face a common challenge, their reliance on power-hungry artificial neural
network backbones, which makes integration into real-world, resource-limited
systems difficult. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising
alternative. Because they operate causally these models are suitable for
real-time use, and their low energy demands make them ideal for
battery-constrained environments. To this end, we introduce Spikachu: a
scalable, causal, and energy-efficient neural decoding framework based on SNNs.
Our approach processes binned spikes directly by projecting them into a shared
latent space, where spiking modules, adapted to the timing of the input,
extract relevant features; these latent representations are then integrated and
decoded to generate behavioral predictions. We evaluate our approach on 113
recording sessions from 6 non-human primates, totaling 43 hours of recordings.
Our method outperforms causal baselines when trained on single sessions using
between 2.26 and 418.81 times less energy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
scaling up training to multiple sessions and subjects improves performance and
enables few-shot transfer to unseen sessions, subjects, and tasks. Overall,
Spikachu introduces a scalable, online-compatible neural decoding framework
based on SNNs, whose performance is competitive relative to state-of-the-art
models while consuming orders of magnitude less energy.

*Sishun Liu,Ke Deng,Xiuzhen Zhang,Yongli Ren,Yan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a thresholding method for MTPP to handle imbalanced event mark distributions, improving prediction of rare marks by tuning mark probabilities with learned thresholds and using a neural MTPP model for efficient time sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MTPP studies overlook the challenge of highly imbalanced event mark distributions in real-world applications, which significantly degrades prediction performance especially for rare marks.

Method: Uses a thresholding method that learns thresholds to tune mark probabilities normalized by prior probabilities, predicts mark first then time, and develops a neural MTPP model for efficient time sampling without expensive numerical integration.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate superior performance against various baselines for next event mark and time prediction.

Conclusion: The proposed solution effectively addresses the imbalanced mark distribution problem in MTPP, achieving improved prediction accuracy for both common and rare marks through threshold-based probability tuning and efficient neural modeling.

Abstract: Marked Temporal Point Process (MTPP) has been well studied to model the event
distribution in marked event streams, which can be used to predict the mark and
arrival time of the next event. However, existing studies overlook that the
distribution of event marks is highly imbalanced in many real-world
applications, with some marks being frequent but others rare. The imbalance
poses a significant challenge to the performance of the next event prediction,
especially for events of rare marks. To address this issue, we propose a
thresholding method, which learns thresholds to tune the mark probability
normalized by the mark's prior probability to optimize mark prediction, rather
than predicting the mark directly based on the mark probability as in existing
studies. In conjunction with this method, we predict the mark first and then
the time. In particular, we develop a novel neural MTPP model to support
effective time sampling and estimation of mark probability without
computationally expensive numerical improper integration. Extensive experiments
on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our solution
against various baselines for the next event mark and time prediction. The code

*Daniel Sorensen,Bappaditya Dey,Minjin Hwang,Sandip Halder*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes two novel approaches for anomaly prediction in semiconductor manufacturing: one using N-BEATS for univariate forecasting assuming variable independence, and another using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to capture inter-variable relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semiconductor manufacturing faces challenges in anomaly prediction including high-dimensional sensor data, severe class imbalance due to rare faults, and complex interdependencies between variables. Moving from detection to prediction is essential for real-time process correction and proactive fault prevention.

Method: A two-stage framework: (1) train forecasting models on anomaly-free data, (2) perform forecasts on unseen data and flag deviations beyond threshold as anomalies. Two approaches: N-BEATS for univariate forecasting assuming independence, and GNN to capture variable relationships.

Result: Both models show strong forecasting performance up to 20 time points and stable anomaly prediction up to 50 time points. GNN consistently outperforms N-BEATS while requiring fewer parameters and lower computational cost.

Conclusion: The GNN approach is positioned as a promising solution for online anomaly forecasting in manufacturing environments, effectively capturing complex variable relationships with better performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Semiconductor manufacturing is an extremely complex and precision-driven
process, characterized by thousands of interdependent parameters collected
across diverse tools and process steps. Multi-variate time-series analysis has
emerged as a critical field for real-time monitoring and fault detection in
such environments. However, anomaly prediction in semiconductor fabrication
presents several critical challenges, including high dimensionality of sensor
data and severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults. Furthermore,
the complex interdependencies between variables complicate both anomaly
prediction and root-cause-analysis. This paper proposes two novel approaches to
advance the field from anomaly detection to anomaly prediction, an essential
step toward enabling real-time process correction and proactive fault
prevention. The proposed anomaly prediction framework contains two main stages:
(a) training a forecasting model on a dataset assumed to contain no anomalies,
and (b) performing forecast on unseen time series data. The forecast is
compared with the forecast of the trained signal. Deviations beyond a
predefined threshold are flagged as anomalies. The two approaches differ in the
forecasting model employed. The first assumes independence between variables by
utilizing the N-BEATS model for univariate time series forecasting. The second
lifts this assumption by utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture
inter-variable relationships. Both models demonstrate strong forecasting
performance up to a horizon of 20 time points and maintain stable anomaly
prediction up to 50 time points. The GNN consistently outperforms the N-BEATS
model while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters and lower
computational cost. These results position the GNN as promising solution for
online anomaly forecasting to be deployed in manufacturing environments.

*Xuran Li,Jingyi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Systematic analysis of sample prioritization strategies for LLM repair, showing that Semantic-Aware Prioritized Sampling (SAPS) achieves the best balance between detoxification, utility preservation, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs can produce toxic or biased outputs, and post-hoc model repair provides a practical remedy, but the high cost of parameter updates motivates selective use of repair data.

Method: Evaluated five selection methods: random sampling, K-Center, gradient-norm-based selection (GraNd), stratified coverage (CCS), and proposed Semantic-Aware Prioritized Sampling (SAPS). Assessed repair effectiveness through toxicity reduction, perplexity, and composite metrics (RPS, OPS, RES).

Result: SAPS achieves the best balance between detoxification, utility preservation, and efficiency, delivering comparable or superior repair outcomes with substantially less data. Random sampling remains effective for large or robust models, while high-overhead methods provide limited benefit.

Conclusion: Sample selection should be regarded as a tunable component of repair pipelines, and selection-based repair establishes an efficient and scalable paradigm for maintaining LLM reliability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems,
yet they can produce toxic or biased outputs that undermine safety and trust.
Post-hoc model repair provides a practical remedy, but the high cost of
parameter updates motivates selective use of repair data. Despite extensive
prior work on data selection for model training, it remains unclear which
sampling criteria are most effective and efficient when applied specifically to
behavioral repair of large generative models. Our study presents a systematic
analysis of sample prioritization strategies for LLM repair. We evaluate five
representative selection methods, including random sampling, K-Center,
gradient-norm-based selection(GraNd), stratified coverage (CCS), and a
Semantic-Aware Prioritized Sampling (SAPS) approach we proposed. Repair
effectiveness and trade-offs are assessed through toxicity reduction,
perplexity on WikiText-2 and LAMBADA, and three composite metrics: the Repair
Proximity Score (RPS), the Overall Performance Score (OPS), and the Repair
Efficiency Score (RES). Experimental results show that SAPS achieves the best
balance between detoxification, utility preservation, and efficiency,
delivering comparable or superior repair outcomes with substantially less data.
Random sampling remains effective for large or robust models, while
high-overhead methods such as CCS and GraNd provide limited benefit. The
optimal data proportion depends on model scale and repair method, indicating
that sample selection should be regarded as a tunable component of repair
pipelines. Overall, these findings establish selection-based repair as an
efficient and scalable paradigm for maintaining LLM reliability.

*Yujia Zheng,Zhuokai Zhao,Zijian Li,Yaqi Xie,Mingze Gao,Lizhu Zhang,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'thought communication' - a paradigm for direct mind-to-mind interaction between AI agents that goes beyond natural language limitations, with theoretical guarantees for recovering shared and private latent thoughts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural language is lossy, ambiguous, and indirect, limiting collective intelligence potential. Current LLM-based multi-agent systems rely solely on language, but machines can go beyond these constraints.

Method: Formalize as latent variable model where agent states are generated by underlying thoughts. Develop framework to extract latent thoughts from agents and assign relevant thoughts with sharing patterns. Prove identifiability of shared/private thoughts and global structure recovery.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks validate the theory and demonstrate collaborative advantages of thought communication over traditional language-based approaches.

Conclusion: Thought communication enables going beyond surface-level observation to leverage hidden generative processes, illuminating potential for solving challenges unsolvable through language alone regardless of compute or data scale.

Abstract: Natural language has long enabled human cooperation, but its lossy,
ambiguous, and indirect nature limits the potential of collective intelligence.
While machines are not subject to these constraints, most LLM-based multi-agent
systems still rely solely on natural language, exchanging tokens or their
embeddings. To go beyond language, we introduce a new paradigm, thought
communication, which enables agents to interact directly mind-to-mind, akin to
telepathy. To uncover these latent thoughts in a principled way, we formalize
the process as a general latent variable model, where agent states are
generated by an unknown function of underlying thoughts. We prove that, in a
nonparametric setting without auxiliary information, both shared and private
latent thoughts between any pair of agents can be identified. Moreover, the
global structure of thought sharing, including which agents share which
thoughts and how these relationships are structured, can also be recovered with
theoretical guarantees. Guided by the established theory, we develop a
framework that extracts latent thoughts from all agents prior to communication
and assigns each agent the relevant thoughts, along with their sharing
patterns. This paradigm naturally extends beyond LLMs to all modalities, as
most observational data arise from hidden generative processes. Experiments on
both synthetic and real-world benchmarks validate the theory and demonstrate
the collaborative advantages of thought communication. We hope this work
illuminates the potential of leveraging the hidden world, as many challenges
remain unsolvable through surface-level observation alone, regardless of
compute or data scale.

TL;DR: The paper introduces explainable benchmarking, which automatically generates explanations for system performance in benchmarks, and presents PruneCEL as a first instantiation for knowledge-graph-based question answering systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarking often summarizes system performance with few metrics, requiring tedious manual analysis with biased results, highlighting the need for automated explanation generation.

Method: Proposes explainable benchmarking paradigm and implements PruneCEL, a novel concept learning approach for large knowledge graphs, to compute performance explanations.

Result: PruneCEL outperforms state-of-the-art concept learners by up to 0.55 F1 points. User study with 41 participants shows 80% accuracy in predicting system behavior from explanations.

Conclusion: Explainable benchmarking enables automatic generation of meaningful performance explanations, with PruneCEL demonstrating effectiveness for knowledge-graph-based QA systems.

Abstract: Evaluating competing systems in a comparable way, i.e., benchmarking them, is
an undeniable pillar of the scientific method. However, system performance is
often summarized via a small number of metrics. The analysis of the evaluation
details and the derivation of insights for further development or use remains a
tedious manual task with often biased results. Thus, this paper argues for a
new type of benchmarking, which is dubbed explainable benchmarking. The aim of
explainable benchmarking approaches is to automatically generate explanations
for the performance of systems in a benchmark. We provide a first instantiation
of this paradigm for knowledge-graph-based question answering systems. We
compute explanations by using a novel concept learning approach developed for
large knowledge graphs called PruneCEL. Our evaluation shows that PruneCEL
outperforms state-of-the-art concept learners on the task of explainable
benchmarking by up to 0.55 points F1 measure. A task-driven user study with 41
participants shows that in 80\% of the cases, the majority of participants can
accurately predict the behavior of a system based on our explanations. Our code

### [209] [Compress to Impress: Efficient LLM Adaptation Using a Single Gradient Step on 100 Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20800)
*Shiva Sreeram,Alaa Maalouf,Pratyusha Sharma,Daniela Rus*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A fast adaptation method for LLMs that identifies key layers for selective rank reduction using gradient analysis on just 100 samples, eliminating exhaustive layer-by-layer search and boosting accuracy without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LASER's exhaustive per-matrix search requiring full-dataset forward passes makes it impractical for rapid deployment, creating need for more efficient adaptation methods.

Method: Use gradient of singular values to identify key matrices, allow multiple subspace clustering for factorization, and evaluate on only 100 samples instead of full dataset.

Result: Achieves up to 24.6 percentage point accuracy improvement, eliminates layer-by-layer sweep overhead, and enables fast adaptation with minimal computational cost.

Conclusion: Combining gradient-based layer selection, multi-subspace factorization, and minimal sample evaluation yields a fast, robust adaptation algorithm that adapts LLMs to new datasets without fine-tuning.

Abstract: Recently, Sharma et al. suggested a method called Layer-SElective-Rank
reduction (LASER) which demonstrated that pruning high-order components of
carefully chosen LLM's weight matrices can boost downstream accuracy -- without
any gradient-based fine-tuning. Yet LASER's exhaustive, per-matrix search (each
requiring full-dataset forward passes) makes it impractical for rapid
deployment. We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i)
Only a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected --
eliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's
singular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the
factorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple
subspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces
overfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to
24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just
100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the
indicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to
further reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream
tasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size. As a result, we show
that combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm for
downstream tasks. Overall, with a single gradient step on 100 examples and a
quick scan of the top candidate layers and factorization techniques, we can

*Lawrence Clegg,John Cartlidge*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A graph neural network model that captures intransitive player relationships in tennis achieves 3.26% ROI by exploiting market inefficiencies in handling complex matchups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intransitive player dominance (A beats B, B beats C, C beats A) is common in tennis but poorly handled by existing forecasting methods and bookmakers like Pinnacle Sports.

Method: Graph neural network approach using temporal directed graphs with players as nodes and historical match outcomes as directed edges to explicitly model intransitive relationships.

Result: Model achieved 65.7% accuracy and 0.215 Brier Score on high intransitivity matchups, generating 3.26% ROI with Kelly staking over 1903 bets.

Conclusion: The graph-based approach successfully captures relational dynamics in intransitive scenarios, revealing a market inefficiency that can be exploited for profitable betting.

Abstract: Intransitive player dominance, where player A beats B, B beats C, but C beats
A, is common in competitive tennis. Yet, there are few known attempts to
incorporate it within forecasting methods. We address this problem with a graph
neural network approach that explicitly models these intransitive relationships
through temporal directed graphs, with players as nodes and their historical
match outcomes as directed edges. We find the bookmaker Pinnacle Sports poorly
handles matches with high intransitive complexity and posit that our
graph-based approach is uniquely positioned to capture relational dynamics in
these scenarios. When selectively betting on higher intransitivity matchups
with our model (65.7% accuracy, 0.215 Brier Score), we achieve significant
positive returns of 3.26% ROI with Kelly staking over 1903 bets, suggesting a
market inefficiency in handling intransitive matchups that our approach
successfully exploits.

*Rui Zhu,Song-Lin Lv,Zi-Kang Wang,Lan-Zhe Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bi-CoG is a plug-and-play method that improves semi-supervised fine-tuning of vision-language models by using both inter-model and intra-model consistency with dynamic pseudo-label assignment, addressing issues of model bias and hyperparameter sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semi-supervised fine-tuning methods suffer from model bias and hyperparameter sensitivity due to reliance on prediction consistency or pre-defined confidence thresholds.

Method: Bi-CoG assigns high-quality pseudo-labels by exploiting both inter-model and intra-model consistency, along with an error-aware dynamic pseudo-label assignment strategy.

Result: Extensive experiments on 14 datasets show Bi-CoG consistently and significantly improves performance of existing methods.

Conclusion: Bi-CoG is an effective plug-and-play methodology that addresses limitations of current semi-supervised fine-tuning approaches through dual consistency guidance and dynamic pseudo-label assignment.

Abstract: Exploiting unlabeled data through semi-supervised learning (SSL) or
leveraging pre-trained models via fine-tuning are two prevailing paradigms for
addressing label-scarce scenarios. Recently, growing attention has been given
to combining fine-tuning of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) with SSL,
forming the emerging paradigm of semi-supervised fine-tuning. However, existing
methods often suffer from model bias and hyperparameter sensitivity, due to
reliance on prediction consistency or pre-defined confidence thresholds. To
address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective plug-and-play
methodology named
$\underline{\textbf{Bi-Co}}$nsistency-$\underline{\textbf{G}}$uided
Self-Training (Bi-CoG), which assigns high-quality and low-bias pseudo-labels,
by simultaneously exploiting inter-model and intra-model consistency, along
with an error-aware dynamic pseudo-label assignment strategy. Both theoretical
analysis and extensive experiments over 14 datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of Bi-CoG, which consistently and significantly improves the
performance of existing methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional multimodal alignment methods assume mutual redundancy across all modalities, which fails in real-world distributed scenarios where modalities may not share complete information.

Method: Proposes a sheaf-theoretic framework that replaces single-space alignment with multiple comparison spaces, models pairwise modality relations through sheaf structures, and uses decentralized contrastive learning-based objectives for training.

*Jan Sobotka,Luca Baroni,Ján Antolík*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MEIcoder is a biologically informed decoding method that uses neuron-specific most exciting inputs (MEIs), structural similarity loss, and adversarial training to achieve state-of-the-art visual stimulus reconstruction from neural activity, especially effective with small datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biological neural data is often scarce in primates/humans due to recording challenges, which limits deep learning decoding performance. Need methods that work well with limited data.

Method: Uses neuron-specific most exciting inputs (MEIs), structural similarity index measure loss, and adversarial training to reconstruct visual stimuli from single-cell V1 activity.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, excels with small datasets (1,000-2,500 neurons, <1,000 training points), reconstructs high-fidelity natural images. MEIs identified as main performance driver.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of reliable decoding in early visual system, provides practical insights for neuroscience and neuroengineering applications.

Abstract: Decoding visual stimuli from neural population activity is crucial for
understanding the brain and for applications in brain-machine interfaces.
However, such biological data is often scarce, particularly in primates or
humans, where high-throughput recording techniques, such as two-photon imaging,
remain challenging or impossible to apply. This, in turn, poses a challenge for
deep learning decoding techniques. To overcome this, we introduce MEIcoder, a
biologically informed decoding method that leverages neuron-specific most
exciting inputs (MEIs), a structural similarity index measure loss, and
adversarial training. MEIcoder achieves state-of-the-art performance in
reconstructing visual stimuli from single-cell activity in primary visual
cortex (V1), especially excelling on small datasets with fewer recorded
neurons. Using ablation studies, we demonstrate that MEIs are the main drivers
of the performance, and in scaling experiments, we show that MEIcoder can
reconstruct high-fidelity natural-looking images from as few as 1,000-2,500
neurons and less than 1,000 training data points. We also propose a unified
benchmark with over 160,000 samples to foster future research. Our results
demonstrate the feasibility of reliable decoding in early visual system and
provide practical insights for neuroscience and neuroengineering applications.

*Jacopo Di Ventura,Jan Felix Kleuker,Aske Plaat,Thomas Moerland*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents the first unified framework for zero-shot reinforcement learning, introducing a consistent notation and taxonomy that organizes existing approaches into direct and compositional representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot RL has emerged as a setting for developing general agents that can solve downstream tasks without additional training, but the field lacks a common analytical lens for comparing different approaches.

Method: The authors develop a unified framework with consistent notation and taxonomy, classifying algorithms into two families: direct representations (end-to-end mappings from rewards to policies) and compositional representations (decomposing representations using value function substructure).

Result: The framework enables direct comparison between methods, highlights shared principles and key differences, and provides an extended bound for successor-feature methods with new performance insights.

Conclusion: By consolidating existing work under a common lens, this framework provides a principled foundation for future zero-shot RL research and outlines a clear path toward developing more general agents.

Abstract: Zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a setting for developing
general agents in an unsupervised manner, capable of solving downstream tasks
without additional training or planning at test-time. Unlike conventional RL,
which optimizes policies for a fixed reward, zero-shot RL requires agents to
encode representations rich enough to support immediate adaptation to any
objective, drawing parallels to vision and language foundation models. Despite
growing interest, the field lacks a common analytical lens.
  We present the first unified framework for zero-shot RL. Our formulation
introduces a consistent notation and taxonomy that organizes existing
approaches and allows direct comparison between them. Central to our framework
is the classification of algorithms into two families: direct representations,
which learn end-to-end mappings from rewards to policies, and compositional
representations, which decompose the representation leveraging the substructure
of the value function. Within this framework, we highlight shared principles
and key differences across methods, and we derive an extended bound for
successor-feature methods, offering a new perspective on their performance in
the zero-shot regime. By consolidating existing work under a common lens, our
framework provides a principled foundation for future research in zero-shot RL
and outlines a clear path toward developing more general agents.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes challenges in integrating MLOps with Operational Technology (OT) systems and proposes adapting MLOps practices using established OT reference models like RAMI 4.0 and ISA-95.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLOps practices are increasingly adopted in industrial settings but face significant challenges when integrated with Operational Technology (OT) systems, requiring systematic approaches for successful implementation.

Method: The paper evaluates RAMI 4.0 and ISA-95 reference models for MLOps integration, provides detailed mapping of MLOps lifecycle components to RAMI 4.0, and demonstrates this through a real-world use case.

Result: Findings show that standard MLOps practices cannot be directly applied to OT environments, but structured adaptation using existing reference models provides a viable pathway for successful integration.

Conclusion: Structured adaptation of MLOps practices using established OT reference models enables successful integration with Operational Technology environments, overcoming fundamental obstacles in combining these two domains.

Abstract: Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) practices are increas- ingly adopted in
industrial settings, yet their integration with Opera- tional Technology (OT)
systems presents significant challenges. This pa- per analyzes the fundamental
obstacles in combining MLOps with OT en- vironments and proposes a systematic
approach to embed MLOps prac- tices into established OT reference models. We
evaluate the suitability of the Reference Architectural Model for Industry 4.0
(RAMI 4.0) and the International Society of Automation Standard 95 (ISA-95) for
MLOps integration and present a detailed mapping of MLOps lifecycle compo-
nents to RAMI 4.0 exemplified by a real-world use case. Our findings
demonstrate that while standard MLOps practices cannot be directly transplanted
to OT environments, structured adaptation using existing reference models can
provide a pathway for successful integration.

*Yuta Kawamoto,Hideaki Iiduka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides a refined convergence analysis of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) under the Expected Smoothness (ES) condition, deriving explicit convergence rates and residual errors for various step-size schedules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical SGD analyses rely on assumptions that are either too strong (bounded variance) or too coarse (uniform noise), while the ES condition offers a more flexible alternative that better captures the relationship between stochastic gradients and the objective function.

Method: The authors refine the Expected Smoothness condition with interpretations and sampling-dependent constants, derive bounds for the expectation of squared full gradient norm, and prove convergence rates with explicit residual errors for different step-size schedules.

Result: The paper proves O(1/K) convergence rates for SGD under ES with explicit residual errors, providing a unified treatment that extends recent work in the field.

Conclusion: This work presents a comprehensive and self-contained convergence analysis of SGD under the Expected Smoothness condition, offering refined interpretations and explicit convergence guarantees that unify and extend recent research in stochastic optimization.

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is the workhorse of large-scale learning,
yet classical analyses rely on assumptions that can be either too strong
(bounded variance) or too coarse (uniform noise). The expected smoothness (ES)
condition has emerged as a flexible alternative that ties the second moment of
stochastic gradients to the objective value and the full gradient. This paper
presents a self-contained convergence analysis of SGD under ES. We (i) refine
ES with interpretations and sampling-dependent constants; (ii) derive bounds of
the expectation of squared full gradient norm; and (iii) prove $O(1/K)$ rates
with explicit residual errors for various step-size schedules. All proofs are
given in full detail in the appendix. Our treatment unifies and extends recent
threads (Khaled and Richt\'arik, 2020; Umeda and Iiduka, 2025).

*Yang Han,Pengyu Wang,Kai Yu,Xin Chen,Lu Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MS-BART is a unified modeling framework that enables cross-modal learning between mass spectra and molecular structures through large-scale pretraining, achieving state-of-the-art performance in molecular identification from mass spectrometry data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Structure elucidation from MS data is challenging due to scarce annotated spectra, and existing pretraining approaches are hindered by the complexity of raw spectral signals.

Method: MS-BART maps mass spectra and molecular structures into a shared token vocabulary, uses multi-task pretraining (denoising and translation), transfers to experimental spectra via finetuning with MIST-generated fingerprints, and employs chemical feedback to reduce molecular hallucination.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on 5/12 key metrics across MassSpecGym and NPLIB1, and is 10x faster than diffusion-based methods.

Conclusion: MS-BART provides an effective framework for cross-modal learning in mass spectrometry, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency in molecular structure elucidation.

Abstract: Mass spectrometry (MS) plays a critical role in molecular identification,
significantly advancing scientific discovery. However, structure elucidation
from MS data remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated spectra.
While large-scale pretraining has proven effective in addressing data scarcity
in other domains, applying this paradigm to mass spectrometry is hindered by
the complexity and heterogeneity of raw spectral signals. To address this, we
propose MS-BART, a unified modeling framework that maps mass spectra and
molecular structures into a shared token vocabulary, enabling cross-modal
learning through large-scale pretraining on reliably computed
fingerprint-molecule datasets. Multi-task pretraining objectives further
enhance MS-BART's generalization by jointly optimizing denoising and
translation task. The pretrained model is subsequently transferred to
experimental spectra through finetuning on fingerprint predictions generated
with MIST, a pre-trained spectral inference model, thereby enhancing robustness
to real-world spectral variability. While finetuning alleviates the
distributional difference, MS-BART still suffers molecular hallucination and
requires further alignment. We therefore introduce a chemical feedback
mechanism that guides the model toward generating molecules closer to the
reference structure. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MS-BART achieves
SOTA performance across 5/12 key metrics on MassSpecGym and NPLIB1 and is
faster by one order of magnitude than competing diffusion-based methods, while
comprehensive ablation studies systematically validate the model's
effectiveness and robustness.

*Aki Rehn,Linzh Zhao,Mikko A. Heikkilä,Antti Honkela*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes hyperparameter selection for differentially private transfer learning, revealing mismatches between theory and practice for clipping bounds and batch sizes, and shows how current heuristics fail under different privacy and compute constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why current theoretical guidance for choosing clipping bounds and batch sizes in differentially private transfer learning doesn't match empirical results, and to provide better insights for hyperparameter selection.

Method: Analyzed gradient distribution changes, examined cumulative DP noise effects, and studied clipping as gradient re-weighting under various privacy and compute constraints.

Result: Found that larger clipping bounds perform better under strong privacy (contradicting theory), existing batch size heuristics don't work, and single hyperparameter settings across tasks lead to suboptimal performance.

Conclusion: Proper hyperparameter selection for DP transfer learning requires considering gradient distribution changes and cumulative DP noise, with different optimal settings needed for varying privacy levels and compute budgets.

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) transfer learning, i.e., fine-tuning a pretrained
model on private data, is the current state-of-the-art approach for training
large models under privacy constraints. We focus on two key hyperparameters in
this setting: the clipping bound $C$ and batch size $B$. We show a clear
mismatch between the current theoretical understanding of how to choose an
optimal $C$ (stronger privacy requires smaller $C$) and empirical outcomes
(larger $C$ performs better under strong privacy), caused by changes in the
gradient distributions. Assuming a limited compute budget (fixed epochs), we
demonstrate that the existing heuristics for tuning $B$ do not work, while
cumulative DP noise better explains whether smaller or larger batches perform
better. We also highlight how the common practice of using a single $(C,B)$
setting across tasks can lead to suboptimal performance. We find that
performance drops especially when moving between loose and tight privacy and
between plentiful and limited compute, which we explain by analyzing clipping
as a form of gradient re-weighting and examining cumulative DP noise.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: H-SPLID is a novel algorithm that explicitly decomposes features into salient and non-salient spaces, promoting low-dimensional task-relevant representations and improving model robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of learning robust feature representations by explicitly separating salient and non-salient features, which helps models focus on task-relevant information while being less sensitive to irrelevant input variations.

Method: H-SPLID explicitly decomposes features into separate salient and non-salient spaces. It establishes theoretical bounds showing that prediction deviation under perturbations is bounded by the dimension of salient subspace and HSIC between inputs and representations.

Result: Empirical evaluations on image classification show models trained with H-SPLID primarily rely on salient input components, with reduced sensitivity to perturbations affecting non-salient features like image backgrounds.

Conclusion: H-SPLID successfully links robustness to latent representation compression through dimensionality and information preservation, enabling models to focus on task-relevant features while maintaining robustness against irrelevant input variations.

Abstract: We introduce H-SPLID, a novel algorithm for learning salient feature
representations through the explicit decomposition of salient and non-salient
features into separate spaces. We show that H-SPLID promotes learning
low-dimensional, task-relevant features. We prove that the expected prediction
deviation under input perturbations is upper-bounded by the dimension of the
salient subspace and the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) between
inputs and representations. This establishes a link between robustness and
latent representation compression in terms of the dimensionality and
information preserved. Empirical evaluations on image classification tasks show
that models trained with H-SPLID primarily rely on salient input components, as
indicated by reduced sensitivity to perturbations affecting non-salient
features, such as image backgrounds. Our code is available at

through three case studies: LMM-based traffic control, LLM-based robot

varying input parameters, and heterogeneous multimodal conditions where
conventional static optimization degrades.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches perform poorly due to limited structural information and engagement data in cloud service monitoring, and traditional methods fail to capture long-range dependencies between entities.

Method: Constructs monitor heterogeneous graph and uses attention-enhanced entity ranking with multi-head attention for heterogeneous neighbors, path sampling via random walks for long-range dependencies, and multi-faceted loss functions for sparse data optimization.

Result: Achieves 43.1% increase in MRR over existing methods, with product teams rating the feature 4.5/5 for usefulness.

Conclusion: The proposed DiRecGNN framework effectively addresses cloud service monitoring challenges and is well-received by users, demonstrating practical value in production environments.

Abstract: In this paper, we present DiRecGNN, an attention-enhanced entity
recommendation framework for monitoring cloud services at Microsoft. We provide
insights on the usefulness of this feature as perceived by the cloud service
owners and lessons learned from deployment. Specifically, we introduce the
problem of recommending the optimal subset of attributes (dimensions) that
should be tracked by an automated watchdog (monitor) for cloud services. To
begin, we construct the monitor heterogeneous graph at production-scale. The
interaction dynamics of these entities are often characterized by limited
structural and engagement information, resulting in inferior performance of
state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, traditional methods fail to capture the
dependencies between entities spanning a long range due to their homophilic
nature. Therefore, we propose an attention-enhanced entity ranking model
inspired by transformer architectures. Our model utilizes a multi-head
attention mechanism to focus on heterogeneous neighbors and their attributes,
and further attends to paths sampled using random walks to capture long-range
dependencies. We also employ multi-faceted loss functions to optimize for
relevant recommendations while respecting the inherent sparsity of the data.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over existing
methods, with our model achieving a 43.1% increase in MRR. Furthermore, product
teams who consumed these features perceive the feature as useful and rated it
4.5 out of 5.

TL;DR: xTime is a novel framework for extreme event forecasting in time series that uses knowledge distillation and mixture of experts to improve prediction of rare extreme events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extreme events in time series (floods, heatwaves, medical episodes) have serious consequences but existing models struggle with them due to data imbalance and neglect of preceding intermediate events.

Method: Uses knowledge distillation to transfer information from models trained on lower-rarity events, and a mixture of experts mechanism that dynamically selects and fuses outputs from expert models across different rarity levels.

Result: Experiments show xTime achieves consistent improvements, with forecasting accuracy on extreme events improving from 3% to 78% across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: xTime effectively addresses the challenges of extreme event forecasting through knowledge distillation and dynamic expert fusion, significantly improving prediction performance for rare events.

Abstract: Extreme events frequently occur in real-world time series and often carry
significant practical implications. In domains such as climate and healthcare,
these events, such as floods, heatwaves, or acute medical episodes, can lead to
serious consequences. Accurate forecasting of such events is therefore of
substantial importance. Most existing time series forecasting models are
optimized for overall performance within the prediction window, but often
struggle to accurately predict extreme events, such as high temperatures or
heart rate spikes. The main challenges are data imbalance and the neglect of
valuable information contained in intermediate events that precede extreme
events. In this paper, we propose xTime, a novel framework for extreme event
forecasting in time series. xTime leverages knowledge distillation to transfer
information from models trained on lower-rarity events, thereby improving
prediction performance on rarer ones. In addition, we introduce a mixture of
experts (MoE) mechanism that dynamically selects and fuses outputs from expert
models across different rarity levels, which further improves the forecasting
performance for extreme events. Experiments on multiple datasets show that
xTime achieves consistent improvements, with forecasting accuracy on extreme
events improving from 3% to 78%.

TL;DR: This paper provides a practical guide for building world models, focusing on the core evolutionary path from masked models to unified architectures, interactive generative models, and memory-augmented systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To offer a clear roadmap for developing world models rather than conducting a comprehensive survey, emphasizing the most promising approach through generative capabilities, interactive loops, and memory systems.

Method: Following a specific evolutionary trajectory: starting from early masked models for multimodal representation learning, progressing to unified architectures with shared paradigms, then to interactive generative models that close the action-perception loop, and finally to memory-augmented systems for temporal consistency.

Result: The paper identifies and demonstrates that focusing on the generative core, interactive loop, and memory system represents the most promising path toward developing true world models.

Conclusion: The essential components for building effective world models are the generative foundation, the interactive feedback loop between perception and action, and memory systems that maintain world consistency over time.

Abstract: This is not a typical survey of world models; it is a guide for those who
want to build worlds. We do not aim to catalog every paper that has ever
mentioned a ``world model". Instead, we follow one clear road: from early
masked models that unified representation learning across modalities, to
unified architectures that share a single paradigm, then to interactive
generative models that close the action-perception loop, and finally to
memory-augmented systems that sustain consistent worlds over time. We bypass
loosely related branches to focus on the core: the generative heart, the
interactive loop, and the memory system. We show that this is the most
promising path towards true world models.

TL;DR: A two-system neural network approach enables continual learning and compositional reuse of skills through contextual inference and low-rank RNN components, preventing catastrophic forgetting while supporting transfer learning and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand neural mechanisms for continual learning and flexible skill composition, addressing how intelligent systems can learn, retain, and reuse skills without catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Two-system approach: (1) 'what' system uses probabilistic generative model to infer computational context and epoch structure from tasks, (2) 'how' system implements computations via RNN with low-rank components composed according to inferred context. Uses unsupervised online learning to build vocabulary incrementally.

Result: The framework enables continual learning without catastrophic forgetting, demonstrates competitive performance, supports forward/backward transfer, and enables fast compositional generalization to unseen tasks.

Conclusion: The two-system approach with contextual inference and compositional RNN components provides an effective mechanism for continual learning and flexible skill reuse, offering insights into neural mechanisms of intelligent behavior.

Abstract: The ability to continually learn, retain and deploy skills to accomplish
goals is a key feature of intelligent and efficient behavior. However, the
neural mechanisms facilitating the continual learning and flexible
(re-)composition of skills remain elusive. Here, we study continual learning
and the compositional reuse of learned computations in recurrent neural network
(RNN) models using a novel two-system approach: one system that infers what
computation to perform, and one that implements how to perform it. We focus on
a set of compositional cognitive tasks commonly studied in neuroscience. To
construct the what system, we first show that a large family of tasks can be
systematically described by a probabilistic generative model, where
compositionality stems from a shared underlying vocabulary of discrete task
epochs. The shared epoch structure makes these tasks inherently compositional.
We first show that this compositionality can be systematically described by a
probabilistic generative model. Furthermore, We develop an unsupervised online
learning approach that can learn this model on a single-trial basis, building
its vocabulary incrementally as it is exposed to new tasks, and inferring the
latent epoch structure as a time-varying computational context within a trial.
We implement the how system as an RNN whose low-rank components are composed
according to the context inferred by the what system. Contextual inference
facilitates the creation, learning, and reuse of low-rank RNN components as new
tasks are introduced sequentially, enabling continual learning without
catastrophic forgetting. Using an example task set, we demonstrate the efficacy
and competitive performance of this two-system learning framework, its

*Fardin Ganjkhanloo,Emmett Springer,Erik H. Hoyer,Daniel L. Young,Kimia Ghobadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Data-driven constrained score optimization models significantly improved fall risk prediction over the standard JHFRAT tool while maintaining interpretability and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better align fall risk prediction with clinically meaningful measures and improve upon the existing Johns Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool (JHFRAT) using a data-driven approach.

Method: Retrospective analysis of 54,209 inpatient admissions using constrained score optimization (CSO) models on JHFRAT assessment data and EHR variables, comparing performance against standard JHFRAT and black-box XGBoost models.

Result: CSO models achieved significantly better predictive performance (AUC-ROC=0.91) than standard JHFRAT (AUC-ROC=0.86), with similar performance with and without EHR variables. While XGBoost had higher AUC-ROC (0.94), CSO showed better robustness to risk labeling variations.

Conclusion: The constrained score optimization approach provides a robust, interpretable foundation for enhancing inpatient fall prevention protocols and improving risk assessment and resource allocation in healthcare settings.

Abstract: In this study we aim to better align fall risk prediction from the Johns
Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool (JHFRAT) with additional clinically
meaningful measures via a data-driven modelling approach. We conducted a
retrospective analysis of 54,209 inpatient admissions from three Johns Hopkins
Health System hospitals between March 2022 and October 2023. A total of 20,208
admissions were included as high fall risk encounters, and 13,941 were included
as low fall risk encounters. To incorporate clinical knowledge and maintain
interpretability, we employed constrained score optimization (CSO) models on
JHFRAT assessment data and additional electronic health record (EHR) variables.
The model demonstrated significant improvements in predictive performance over
the current JHFRAT (CSO AUC-ROC=0.91, JHFRAT AUC-ROC=0.86). The constrained
score optimization models performed similarly with and without the EHR
variables. Although the benchmark black-box model (XGBoost), improves upon the
performance metrics of the knowledge-based constrained logistic regression
(AUC-ROC=0.94), the CSO demonstrates more robustness to variations in risk
labelling. This evidence-based approach provides a robust foundation for health
systems to systematically enhance inpatient fall prevention protocols and
patient safety using data-driven optimization techniques, contributing to
improved risk assessment and resource allocation in healthcare settings.

*Jasmine Bayrooti,Sattar Vakili,Amanda Prorok,Carl Henrik Ek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper establishes theoretical regret bounds for Thompson sampling in episodic reinforcement learning with Gaussian process priors over rewards and transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thompson sampling is widely used in sequential decision-making but lacks theoretical foundations in complex settings like reinforcement learning, particularly with temporal structure.

Method: Analyzes Thompson sampling in episodic RL with joint Gaussian process priors over rewards and transitions, addressing non-Gaussian value functions and recursive Bellman updates.

Result: Proves a regret bound of $\mathcal{\\tilde{O}}(\\sqrt{KH\\Gamma(KH)})$ over K episodes of horizon H, where Γ(·) captures GP model complexity.

Conclusion: This work advances understanding of Thompson sampling in RL and shows how structural assumptions and model uncertainty affect performance in finite-horizon MDPs.

Abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) is a powerful and widely used strategy for sequential
decision-making, with applications ranging from Bayesian optimization to
reinforcement learning (RL). Despite its success, the theoretical foundations
of TS remain limited, particularly in settings with complex temporal structure
such as RL. We address this gap by establishing no-regret guarantees for TS
using models with Gaussian marginal distributions. Specifically, we consider TS
in episodic RL with joint Gaussian process (GP) priors over rewards and
transitions. We prove a regret bound of
$\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\sqrt{KH\Gamma(KH)})$ over $K$ episodes of horizon $H$,
where $\Gamma(\cdot)$ captures the complexity of the GP model. Our analysis
addresses several challenges, including the non-Gaussian nature of value
functions and the recursive structure of Bellman updates, and extends classical
tools such as the elliptical potential lemma to multi-output settings. This
work advances the understanding of TS in RL and highlights how structural
assumptions and model uncertainty shape its performance in finite-horizon
Markov Decision Processes.

### [227] [Amplifying Prominent Representations in Multimodal Learning via Variational Dirichlet Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20736)
*Tsai Hor Chan,Feng Wu,Yihang Chen,Guosheng Yin,Lequan Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new multimodal fusion framework using Dirichlet Process (DP) mixture model to balance intra-modal representation learning and cross-modal alignment, leveraging DP's richer-gets-richer property to amplify prominent features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous multimodal fusion approaches over-emphasized cross-modal alignment, which may impose excess regularization and obstruct meaningful representations within each modality. The challenge is preserving feature expressiveness while learning cross-modal interactions.

Method: Proposes a DP-driven multimodal learning framework where each modality follows a mixture of multivariate Gaussian distributions, and DP calculates mixture weights to dynamically allocate feature contributions and select prominent features using its richer-gets-richer property.

Result: Extensive experiments on several multimodal datasets demonstrate superior performance over competitors. Ablation analysis validates DP's effectiveness in aligning modality distributions and robustness to hyperparameter changes.

Conclusion: The DP-based framework successfully achieves optimal balance between intra-modal representation learning and cross-modal alignment, providing an effective solution for multimodal feature fusion.

Abstract: Developing effective multimodal fusion approaches has become increasingly
essential in many real-world scenarios, such as health care and finance. The
key challenge is how to preserve the feature expressiveness in each modality
while learning cross-modal interactions. Previous approaches primarily focus on
the cross-modal alignment, while over-emphasis on the alignment of marginal
distributions of modalities may impose excess regularization and obstruct
meaningful representations within each modality. The Dirichlet process (DP)
mixture model is a powerful Bayesian non-parametric method that can amplify the
most prominent features by its richer-gets-richer property, which allocates
increasing weights to them. Inspired by this unique characteristic of DP, we
propose a new DP-driven multimodal learning framework that automatically
achieves an optimal balance between prominent intra-modal representation
learning and cross-modal alignment. Specifically, we assume that each modality
follows a mixture of multivariate Gaussian distributions and further adopt DP
to calculate the mixture weights for all the components. This paradigm allows
DP to dynamically allocate the contributions of features and select the most
prominent ones, leveraging its richer-gets-richer property, thus facilitating
multimodal feature fusion. Extensive experiments on several multimodal datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of our model over other competitors.
Ablation analysis further validates the effectiveness of DP in aligning
modality distributions and its robustness to changes in key hyperparameters.

### [228] [Out-of-distribution Tests Reveal Compositionality in Chess Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20783)
*Anna Mészáros,Patrik Reizinger,Ferenc Huszár*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers trained on chess show compositional generalization by adhering to game rules in out-of-distribution scenarios, including Chess960, though they underperform symbolic AI in strategic adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether decision Transformers truly understand chess rules and exhibit systematic generalization, rather than just learning patterns from training data.

Method: Trained a 270M parameter chess Transformer and tested it on out-of-distribution scenarios including rule extrapolation tests and Chess960 variants, comparing performance against symbolic AI algorithms.

Result: Transformers demonstrated strong compositional generalization by consistently choosing valid moves in unfamiliar situations and generating high-quality moves for OOD puzzles. They showed basic strategy adaptation in Chess960 but were inferior to symbolic AI, though the gap narrowed in human gameplay.

Conclusion: Transformers exhibit emergent compositional understanding of chess rules and can generalize to novel scenarios, but still lag behind symbolic AI in strategic reasoning, particularly in randomized variants like Chess960.

Abstract: Chess is a canonical example of a task that requires rigorous reasoning and
long-term planning. Modern decision Transformers - trained similarly to LLMs -
are able to learn competent gameplay, but it is unclear to what extent they
truly capture the rules of chess. To investigate this, we train a 270M
parameter chess Transformer and test it on out-of-distribution scenarios,
designed to reveal failures of systematic generalization. Our analysis shows
that Transformers exhibit compositional generalization, as evidenced by strong
rule extrapolation: they adhere to fundamental syntactic rules of the game by
consistently choosing valid moves even in situations very different from the
training data. Moreover, they also generate high-quality moves for OOD puzzles.
In a more challenging test, we evaluate the models on variants including
Chess960 (Fischer Random Chess) - a variant of chess where starting positions
of pieces are randomized. We found that while the model exhibits basic strategy
adaptation, they are inferior to symbolic AI algorithms that perform explicit
search, but gap is smaller when playing against users on Lichess. Moreover, the
training dynamics revealed that the model initially learns to move only its own
pieces, suggesting an emergent compositional understanding of the game.

*Liang Ye,Shengqin Chen,Jiazhu Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BadGraph is a backdoor attack method targeting latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation, using textual triggers to poison training data and induce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the security concerns in graph generation, particularly the unexplored backdoor vulnerabilities in text-guided graph generation models, which have serious implications for applications like drug discovery.

Method: BadGraph leverages textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors in latent diffusion models that activate during inference when triggers appear, while maintaining normal performance on clean inputs.

Result: Extensive experiments show high effectiveness and stealth: less than 10% poisoning rate achieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate, with negligible performance degradation on benign samples.

Conclusion: The findings reveal significant security vulnerabilities in latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation, highlighting serious risks in applications like drug discovery and underscoring the need for robust defenses against such backdoor attacks.

Abstract: The rapid progress of graph generation has raised new security concerns,
particularly regarding backdoor vulnerabilities. While prior work has explored
backdoor attacks in image diffusion and unconditional graph generation,
conditional, especially text-guided graph generation remains largely
unexamined. This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method targeting
latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages
textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that
induce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear,
while preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the
effectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can
achieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate,
with negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies
further reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training
rather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in
latent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious
risks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need
for robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models.

### [230] [KL-Regularized Reinforcement Learning is Designed to Mode Collapse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20817)
*Anthony GX-Chen,Jatin Prakash,Jeff Guo,Rob Fergus,Rajesh Ranganath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper challenges conventional wisdom about KL divergence in RL, showing that reverse/forward KL choice determines optimal target distributions rather than mode seeking/covering behavior. It introduces a simple algorithm that modifies reward scaling to achieve diverse, high-quality sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To correct misconceptions about KL divergence in reinforcement learning, particularly the belief that forward KL leads to mass covering while reverse KL leads to mode seeking, and to develop better methods for achieving diverse sampling in language model training.

Method: The authors mathematically analyze KL divergence properties in RL contexts and develop a simple algorithm that minimally modifies reward magnitudes to optimize for target distributions covering all high-quality sampling modes, without requiring external diversity signals.

Result: The proposed method successfully post-trains both Large Language Models and Chemical Language Models to achieve higher solution quality and diversity, working with both forward and reverse KL where naive approaches fail.

Conclusion: Mode coverage in RL with KL regularization depends primarily on regularization strength and reward-probability scaling rather than KL direction choice, and a simple reward modification can achieve diverse, high-quality sampling across different model types.

Abstract: It is commonly believed that optimizing the reverse KL divergence results in
"mode seeking", while optimizing forward KL results in "mass covering", with
the latter being preferred if the goal is to sample from multiple diverse
modes. We show -- mathematically and empirically -- that this intuition does
not necessarily transfer well to doing reinforcement learning with
reverse/forward KL regularization (e.g. as commonly used with language models).
Instead, the choice of reverse/forward KL determines the family of optimal
target distributions, parameterized by the regularization coefficient. Mode
coverage depends primarily on other factors, such as regularization strength,
and relative scales between rewards and reference probabilities. Further, we
show commonly used settings such as low regularization strength and equal
verifiable rewards tend to specify unimodal target distributions, meaning the
optimization objective is, by construction, non-diverse. We leverage these
insights to construct a simple, scalable, and theoretically justified
algorithm. It makes minimal changes to reward magnitudes, yet optimizes for a
target distribution which puts high probability over all high-quality sampling
modes. In experiments, this simple modification works to post-train both Large
Language Models and Chemical Language Models to have higher solution quality
and diversity, without any external signals of diversity, and works with both
forward and reverse KL when using either naively fails.

TL;DR: Advanced machine learning with EEG feature extraction enables real-time, high-accuracy neural decoding for imagined handwriting on portable edge devices, achieving 89.83% accuracy with low latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a non-invasive BCI that overcomes EEG's limitations (low signal-to-noise ratio, poor spatial resolution) while providing intuitive character-level communication for motor/speech impaired individuals, avoiding surgical risks of invasive methods.

Method: Collected 32-channel EEG data from 15 participants performing imagined handwriting. Used bandpass filtering and artifact subspace reconstruction for preprocessing, extracted 85 time-, frequency-, and graphical-domain features, and developed EEdGeNet - a hybrid architecture combining Temporal Convolutional Network with multilayer perceptron.

Result: Achieved 89.83% accuracy with 914.18 ms per-character latency on NVIDIA Jetson TX2. Feature selection reduced latency to 202.6 ms (4.5x improvement) with less than 1% accuracy loss.

Conclusion: The approach establishes a pathway for accurate, low-latency, fully portable non-invasive BCIs that support real-time communication through imagined handwriting.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer a pathway to restore communication for
individuals with severe motor or speech impairments. Imagined handwriting
provides an intuitive paradigm for character-level neural decoding, bridging
the gap between human intention and digital communication. While invasive
approaches such as electrocorticography (ECoG) achieve high accuracy, their
surgical risks limit widespread adoption. Non-invasive electroencephalography
(EEG) offers safer and more scalable alternatives but suffers from low
signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution, constraining its decoding
precision. This work demonstrates that advanced machine learning combined with
informative EEG feature extraction can overcome these barriers, enabling
real-time, high-accuracy neural decoding on portable edge devices. A 32-channel
EEG dataset was collected from fifteen participants performing imagined
handwriting. Signals were preprocessed with bandpass filtering and artifact
subspace reconstruction, followed by extraction of 85 time-, frequency-, and
graphical-domain features. A hybrid architecture, EEdGeNet, integrates a
Temporal Convolutional Network with a multilayer perceptron trained on the
extracted features. When deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson TX2, the system achieved
89.83 percent accuracy with 914.18 ms per-character latency. Selecting only ten
key features reduced latency by 4.5 times to 202.6 ms with less than 1 percent
loss in accuracy. These results establish a pathway for accurate, low-latency,
and fully portable non-invasive BCIs supporting real-time communication.

under dynamic channels without transmitter knowledge. To address this need,
this article presents a labeled synthetic dataset designed for wireless

TL;DR: Proposes a semantic communication system for concurrent task execution and data reconstruction in multi-user scenarios, formulated as mutual information maximization with a convex combination of both objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most semantic communication works focus on either task execution or data reconstruction separately, with limited work combining both objectives, especially in multi-user scenarios.

Method: Formulates the problem as mutual information maximization with a joint objective as convex combination of task execution and data reconstruction. Shows SSIM loss can be derived from mutual information for data reconstruction.

Result: Demonstrates that increasing reconstruction weight up to a certain point can significantly improve data reconstruction while keeping task execution performance nearly constant for fixed resource usage.

Conclusion: The proposed system enables effective trade-off between task execution and data reconstruction, with SSIM loss providing human perception-aware reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Semantic communication has gained significant attention with the advances in
machine learning. Most semantic communication works focus on either task
execution or data reconstruction, with some recent works combining the two. In
this work, we propose a semantic communication system for concurrent task
execution and data reconstruction for a multi-user scenario, which we formulate
as the maximization of mutual information. To investigate the trade-off between
the two objectives, we formulate a joint objective as a convex combination of
task execution and data reconstruction. We show that under specific
assumptions, the \ac{SSIM} loss can be obtained from the mutual information
maximization objective for data reconstruction, which takes human visual
perception into account. Furthermore, for constant resource use, we show that
by increasing the weight of the reconstruction objective up to a certain point,
the task execution performance can be kept nearly constant, while the data
reconstruction can be significantly improved.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance signal coverage and SNR in 5G networks using RIS technology, particularly for mmWave frequencies where signal propagation is challenging.

Method: Developed a modular 32×32 1-bit RIS operating at 28 GHz, integrated with O-RAN E2 interface for dynamic control, and implemented two real-time mobility management algorithms for joint RIS and UE beam tracking.

Result: Field trials showed significant received signal power gains: 9-20 dB indoors and 6-18 dB outdoors. Mobility algorithms successfully tracked and adapted beams in real-time as UE moved.

Conclusion: RIS integration into O-RAN systems is practically feasible and can significantly enhance coverage, mobility support, and link reliability in next-generation cellular networks.

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) can redirect electromagnetic waves
to desired directions to enhance signal coverage and/or improve signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) at the user equipment (UE). We present the design, implementation,
and evaluation of an RIS-assisted O-RAN 5G system operating in the FR2
millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency band. We first introduce the design of 1,024
element (32 $\times$ 32) 1-bit RIS operating at the 28 GHz band, utilizing a
modular and scalable tiled architecture. Then we demonstrate how the O-RAN E2
interface can be leveraged to dynamically control RIS configurations without
modifying standard 5G signaling procedures. To evaluate the RIS-assisted 5G
system, we conducted extensive field trials in both indoor and outdoor
environments. The results of the O-RAN link coverage trials show that the
deployed RIS provides substantial received signal power gains, ranging from 9
to 20 dB and 6 to 18 dB in indoor and outdoors scenarios, respectively.
Handling UE mobility in RIS-assisted systems is challenging due to the need for
joint RIS and UE beam management. For that, we develop two UE mobility
management algorithms and evaluate them in real-time operation using the RIS
O-RAN testbed. These algorithms leverage the received signal power at the UE to
jointly track and adapt the RIS and UE beams in real time as the UE moves. The
findings draw important insights into the practical feasibility of integrating
RIS into O-RAN systems to enhance coverage, mobility support, and link
reliability in next-generation cellular networks.

TL;DR: This paper proposes an optimized signal design for OTFS-based dual-functional radar-communication systems that jointly optimizes pilot-symbol design and data-power allocation to enhance both sensing and communication performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OTFS offers advantages for mobility management in wireless sensing and communication, but optimal signal design for dual-functional radar-communication systems using OTFS has not been sufficiently explored.

Method: Formulated an optimization problem using integrated sidelobe level (ISL) of ambiguity function for radar metric and channel capacity lower bound for communication metric, solved via alternating optimization framework.

Result: Proposed signal achieves at least 9.44 dB gain in ISL suppression for sensing and 4.82 dB gain in SINR for communication compared to conventional schemes.

Conclusion: The optimized signal design significantly improves the sensing-communication performance region in OTFS-based DFRC systems.

Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) offers significant advantages in
managing mobility for both wireless sensing and communication systems, making
it a promising candidate for dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC).
However, the optimal signal design that fully exploits OTFS's potential in DFRC
has not been sufficiently explored. This paper addresses this gap by
formulating an optimization problem for signal design in DFRC-OTFS,
incorporating both pilot-symbol design for channel estimation and data-power
allocation. Specifically, we employ the integrated sidelobe level (ISL) of the
ambiguity function as a radar metric, accounting for the randomness of the data
symbols alongside the deterministic pilot symbols. For communication, we derive
a channel capacity lower bound metric that considers channel estimation errors
in OTFS. We maximize the weighted sum of sensing and communication metrics and
solve the optimization problem via an alternating optimization framework.
Simulations indicate that the proposed signal significantly improves the
sensing-communication performance region compared with conventional signal
schemes, achieving at least a 9.44 dB gain in ISL suppression for sensing, and
a 4.82 dB gain in the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for
communication.

Motivation: Underwater data infrastructures face acoustic injection attacks that disrupt data integrity, but existing TDOA/FDOA methods fail with dynamic receiver configurations needed for practical surveillance.

Method: Uses heterogeneous hydrophone arrays (fixed + mobile) with Locus-Conditioned Maximum A-Posteriori (LC-MAP) scheme for geometrically consistent priors, integrated into unscented Kalman filtering (UKF) pipeline for nonlinear tracking.

Abstract: Underwater data infrastructures offer natural cooling and enhanced physical
security compared to terrestrial facilities, but are susceptible to acoustic
injection attacks that can disrupt data integrity and availability. This work
presents a comprehensive surveillance framework for localizing and tracking
close-range adversarial acoustic sources targeting offshore infrastructures,
particularly underwater data centers (UDCs). We propose a heterogeneous
receiver configuration comprising a fixed hydrophone mounted on the facility
and a mobile hydrophone deployed on a dedicated surveillance robot. While using
enough arrays of static hydrophones covering large infrastructures is not
feasible in practice, off-the-shelf approaches based on time difference of
arrival (TDOA) and frequency difference of arrival (FDOA) filtering fail to
generalize for this dynamic configuration. To address this, we formulate a
Locus-Conditioned Maximum A-Posteriori (LC-MAP) scheme to generate acoustically
informed and geometrically consistent priors, ensuring a physically plausible
initial state for a joint TDOA-FDOA filtering. We integrate this into an
unscented Kalman filtering (UKF) pipeline, which provides reliable convergence
under nonlinearity and measurement noise. Extensive Monte Carlo analyses,
Gazebo-based physics simulations, and field trials demonstrate that the
proposed framework can reliably estimate the 3D position and velocity of an
adversarial acoustic attack source in real time. It achieves sub-meter
localization accuracy and over 90% success rates, with convergence times nearly
halved compared to baseline methods. Overall, this study establishes a
geometry-aware, real-time approach for acoustic threat localization, advancing
autonomous surveillance capabilities of underwater infrastructures.

### [239] [Sensing Security in Near-Field ISAC: Exploiting Scatterers for Eavesdropper Deception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20140)
*Jiangong Chen,Xia Lei,Kaitao Meng,Kawon Han,Yuchen Zhang,Christos Masouros,Athina P. Petropulu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A location deception scheme for near-field ISAC that uses known scatterers to mislead eavesdroppers by making them mistake scatterers for targets, without requiring prior information about eavesdroppers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance sensing security in ISAC scenarios by protecting legitimate targets from detection by eavesdroppers with sensing capabilities, without needing to know the eavesdroppers' characteristics or locations.

Method: Proposed a location deception scheme that illuminates scatterers with higher power than targets, uses fractional programming and semidefinite relaxation for optimization, and employs CRB, MSE, and KLD metrics for security evaluation.

Result: The scheme can flexibly adjust beamforming strategies to achieve tradeoffs between communication, sensing, and security, significantly enhancing clutter signal strength at eavesdroppers to cause target misdetection.

Conclusion: The proposed location deception framework effectively enhances sensing security by confusing eavesdroppers through deliberate scatterer illumination, achieving desired performance tradeoffs without requiring prior knowledge of eavesdroppers.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore sensing security in near-field (NF) integrated
sensing and communication (ISAC) scenarios by exploiting known scatterers in
the sensing scene. We propose a location deception (LD) scheme where scatterers
are deliberately illuminated with probing power that is higher than that
directed toward targets of interest, with the goal of deceiving potential
eavesdroppers (Eves) with sensing capability into misidentifying scatterers as
targets. While the known scatterers can be removed at the legitimate sensing
receiver, our LD approach causes Eves to misdetect targets. Notably, this
deception is achieved without requiring any prior information about the Eves'
characteristics or locations. To strike a flexible three-way tradeoff among
communication, sensing, and sensing-security performance, the sum rate and
power allocated to scatterers are weighted and maximized under a legitimate
radar signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint. We employ the
fractional programming (FP) framework and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) to
solve this problem. To evaluate the security of the proposed LD scheme, the
Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) and mean squared error (MSE) metrics are employed.
Additionally, we introduce the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) gap between
targets and scatterers at Eve to quantify the impact of the proposed LD
framework on Eve's sensing performance from an information-theoretical
perspective. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LD scheme can
flexibly adjust the beamforming strategy according to performance requirements,
thereby achieving the desired three-way tradeoff. In particular, in terms of
sensing security, the proposed scheme significantly enhances the clutter signal
strength at Eve's side, leading to confusion or even missed detection of the
actual target.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper proposes a deep learning-based joint space-time-frequency channel prediction model for cell-free massive MIMO systems, using enhanced Transformer with frequency and space convolution layers to improve prediction accuracy and reduce computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Channel prediction is crucial for obtaining accurate CSI to improve performance in 6G cell-free massive MIMO systems, which requires leveraging space-time-frequency correlations in irregular AP deployments.

Method: Proposed a novel channel prediction model that adds frequency convolution (FreqConv) and space convolution (SpaceConv) layers to Transformer-encoder to utilize space-time-frequency correlations and extract space correlation in irregular AP deployments.

Result: The proposed model achieves higher prediction accuracy than traditional models and lower computational complexity than traditional Transformer models, verified on both simulated datasets and realistic HST LTE network datasets.

Conclusion: The enhanced Transformer model with space and frequency convolution layers effectively improves channel prediction performance for CF-mMIMO systems, demonstrating practical value in real-world scenarios like high-speed train networks.

Abstract: The cell-free massive multi-input multi-output (CF-mMIMO) is a promising
technology for the six generation (6G) communication systems. Channel
prediction will play an important role in obtaining the accurate CSI to improve
the performance of CF-mMIMO systems. This paper studies a deep learning (DL)
based joint space-time-frequency domain channel prediction for CF-mMIMO.
Firstly, the prediction problems are formulated, which can output the
multi-step prediction results in parallel without error propagation. Then, a
novel channel prediction model is proposed, which adds frequency convolution
(FreqConv) and space convolution (SpaceConv) layers to Transformer-encoder. It
is able to utilize the space-time-frequency correlations and extract the space
correlation in the irregular AP deployment. Next, simulated datasets with
different sizes of service areas, UE velocities and scenarios are generated,
and correlation analysis and cross-validation are used to determine the optimal
hyper-parameters. According to the optimized hyper-parameters, the prediction
accuracy and computational complexity are evaluated based on simulated
datasets. It is indicated that the prediction accuracy of the proposed model is
higher than traditional model, and its computational complexity is lower than
traditional Transformer model. After that, the impacts of space-time-frequency
correlations on prediction accuracy are studied. Finally, realistic datasets in
a high-speed train (HST) long-term evolution (LTE) network are collected to
verify the prediction accuracy. The verification results demonstrate that it
also achieves higher prediction accuracy compared with traditional models in
the HST LTE network.

### [241] [NOMA for Visible Light Communications: Recent Advances and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20215)
*Xuesong Wang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper reviews Visible Light Communications (VLC) for 6G networks, highlighting the limitations of current standards adapted from RF systems and proposing NOMA (Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access) as a promising MAC layer solution for VLC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing demand for high-speed data in 6G networks requires larger link scales, lower latency, and higher spectral efficiency. Current VLC standards (ITU G.9991 and IEEE 802.11bb) are adapted from RF technologies and don't fully exploit optical nature, making TDMA inefficient for asymmetric traffic.

Method: The paper reviews progress in VLC and NOMA-based VLC, outlines key optimization constraints and objectives, surveys scenarios suitable for NOMA in VLC, and identifies future research directions.

Result: NOMA is identified as a promising approach for VLC that allows multiple users to share the same time and frequency resources while tolerating controlled interference, potentially yielding large gains in spectral efficiency.

Conclusion: A clean slate design for VLC at the MAC layer is needed, with NOMA showing particular promise for 6G VLC networks to overcome limitations of current RF-adapted standards and handle asymmetric traffic patterns effectively.

Abstract: Rapidly increasing demand for high speed data is pushing 6G wireless networks
to support larger link scales, lower latency, and higher spectral efficiency.
Visible light communications (VLC) is a strong complement to radio frequency
(RF) systems within 6G. The latest ITU G.9991 and IEEE 802.11bb standards are
adapted from cable and RF wireless technologies for use in VLC, so they do not
fully exploit the optical nature of light links. VLC links are often asymmetric
between uplink and downlink, which makes TDMA style protocols inefficient when
many users generate bursty and asymmetric traffic. Compared with RF, the strong
directionality and frequent line of sight in VLC can mitigate hidden and
exposed terminals, yet these effects can still appear under limited field of
view, blockage, or reflections. CSMA/CA and related methods remain usable in
VLC and in RF plus VLC networks, but they usually need design tweaks such as
RTS/CTS or directional sensing to perform well. Although the optical spectrum
is vast, the bandwidth of practical LEDs and of common PIN or APD receivers is
limited, so efficient multiple access can yield large gains. This motivates a
clean slate design for VLC, especially at the MAC layer. NOMA, first explored
in 5G RF systems, is also promising for 6G VLC. It lets multiple users share
the same time and frequency resources while tolerating controlled interference.
This paper reviews progress in VLC and in NOMA based VLC, outlines key
optimization constraints and objectives, surveys scenarios that fit NOMA in
VLC, and points to several directions for future work.

Conclusion: OTFS-IM systems show promise for 6G networks but face challenges in complexity, efficiency, latency, channel estimation, hardware constraints, synchronization, and security. Future research should focus on integration with other advanced wireless techniques and addressing these implementation challenges.

Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) is a two-dimensional modulation
technique that uses the delay-Doppler (DD) domain and is a candidate for
providing robust, high-capacity wireless communications for envisioned 6G and
beyond networks. The OTFS technique maps data to the DD domain instead of the
traditional time-frequency domain, enabling it to fully utilize channel
diversity and transform fast time-varying channels into nearly static channels.
Index modulation (IM) is a communication paradigm that conveys information not
only through conventional modulation symbols but also by encoding data bits in
the indices of the selected communication resources to improve error
performance, spectral efficiency, and energy efficiency. In this survey, a
comprehensive review of work on OTFS-based wireless communication systems is
presented. In particular, the existing OTFS-IM schemes are reviewed and
systematically categorized according to their system architectures, detection

OTFS-based media-based modulation, and OTFS-based code index modulation-are
described, followed by a comparative performance analysis in terms of
computational complexity, error performance, capacity, energy saving, spectral
efficiency, and throughput. Finally, the challenges, benefits, and future
directions for OTFS-IM systems are discussed, covering key aspects such as
complexity, efficiency, latency, channel estimation, hardware constraints,
synchronization, security, and potential integration with other advanced
wireless communication techniques.

*Kangda Zhi,Tianyu Yang,Songyan Xue,Giuseppe Caire*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Proposes a three-stage algorithm for channel estimation and 3D localization in near-field XL-MIMO systems with multi-antenna users, combining OMP, MUSIC, and SBL techniques to overcome limitations of existing codebooks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing channel estimation codebooks are ineffective for near-field XL-MIMO with multi-antenna users because the uplink MIMO channel has full column rank, requiring new approaches beyond far-field or single-antenna user designs.

Method: Three-stage algorithm: 1) Partition XL-MIMO into subarrays and use OMP with DFT-based dictionary for subarray channel estimation; 2) Estimate user array center location using MUSIC and LS criterion; 3) Construct location-aided dictionary and obtain final MIMO channel estimation using SBL.

Result: The proposed algorithm demonstrates significant superiority over benchmarks in both pilot overhead reduction and estimation accuracy improvement.

Conclusion: The three-stage OMP-MUSIC-SBL approach effectively addresses the channel estimation challenges in near-field XL-MIMO systems with multi-antenna users, providing superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: This paper investigates the design of channel estimation and 3D localization
algorithms in a challenging scenario, where a sub-connected planar extremely
large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) communicates with
multi-antenna users. In the near field, the uplink MIMO channel is of full
column rank and therefore can not be estimated effectively by applying existing
codebooks that are designed for the far-field case or for the near-field case
but limited to single antenna users. To solve this problem, we propose a
three-stage algorithm aided by orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) and sparse
Bayesian learning (SBL). Specifically, we firstly partition the XL-MIMO into
subarrays and use OMP to solve the compressed sensing (CS) problem about
subarray channel estimation with the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)-based
dictionary matrix. Secondly, exploiting the estimated subarray channels and
employing one-dimensional multiple signal classification (MUSIC), we estimate
the central location of the user array under the Least Squares (LS) criterion.
Finally, we utilize the estimated central location to construct a refined
location-aided dictionary matrix and obtain the MIMO channel estimation using
SBL. Results exhibit the significant superiority of the proposed algorithm
compared with several benchmarks, in terms of both the pilot overhead and
estimation accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pixel-based RIS eliminates phase shifters for cost reduction but creates challenges in channel estimation and beamforming due to non-separable state response, making existing methods ineffective.

Method: Approximate non-separable RIS response using kernel-based method and DNN; propose simplified cascaded channel model focusing on dominant paths; develop customized algorithms for parameter estimation and low-complexity passive beamforming.

Result: Simulation results show the proposed solution significantly outperforms various baselines across wide SNR range.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses challenges in pixel-based RIS systems through accurate response approximation, simplified channel modeling, and efficient algorithms, achieving superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Pixel-based reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) employ a novel design
to achieve high reflection gain at a lower hardware cost by eliminating the
phase shifters used in traditional RIS. However, this design presents
challenges for channel estimation and passive beamforming due to its
non-separable state response, rendering existing solutions ineffective. To
address this, we first approximate the non-separable RIS response functions
using a kernel-based method and a deep neural network, achieving high accuracy
while reducing computational and memory complexity. Next, we propose a
simplified cascaded channel model that focuses on dominated scattering paths
with limited unknown parameters, along with customized algorithms to estimate
short-term and long-term parameters separately. Finally, we introduce a
low-complexity passive beamforming algorithm to configure the discrete RIS
state vector, maximizing the achievable rate. Our simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed solution significantly outperforms various
baselines across a wide SNR range.

Motivation: To develop a MIMO detection method that combines model-based interpretability with data-driven flexibility, addressing the challenge of inter-stream interference in high-order, mixed QAM modulation schemes.

Method: Treats each transmit layer as a token, derives queries and keys from estimated channel matrix to quantify channel correlation, initializes values with matched-filter outputs and iteratively refines them using lightweight self-attention mechanism.

Result: Through link-level simulations under realistic 5G channel models, AttDet approaches near-optimal BER/BLER performance while maintaining predictable, polynomial complexity.

Conclusion: AttDet successfully combines model-based interpretability with data-driven flexibility, providing an effective MIMO detection solution that achieves near-optimal performance with manageable computational complexity.

Abstract: We present AttDet, a Transformer-inspired MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple
Output) detection method that treats each transmit layer as a token and learns
inter-stream interference via a lightweight self-attention mechanism. Queries
and keys are derived directly from the estimated channel matrix, so attention
scores quantify channel correlation. Values are initialized by matched-filter
outputs and iteratively refined. The AttDet design combines model-based
interpretability with data-driven flexibility. We demonstrate through
link-level simulations under realistic 5G channel models and high-order, mixed
QAM modulation and coding schemes, that AttDet can approach near-optimal
BER/BLER (Bit Error Rate/Block Error Rate) performance while maintaining
predictable, polynomial complexity.

*Anwar Ahmed Khan,Indrakshi Dey*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Comparison of two MAC protocols (BoP-MAC and FROG-MAC) for industrial M2M networks shows FROG-MAC performs better for multi-priority data in terms of delay and throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for efficient MAC protocols to enable low-latency and reliable communication in industrial M2M networks with multi-priority data in high-risk environments.

Method: Comprehensive cross-comparison of BoP-MAC (contention window-based with differentiated back-off) and FROG-MAC (fragmentation-based enabling early transmission of high-priority packets) through simulations on Contiki with varying node counts for two traffic priorities.

Result: FROG-MAC outperforms BoP-MAC in both delay and throughput when handling multi-priority heterogeneous data in industrial environments.

Conclusion: FROG-MAC is more effective than BoP-MAC for industrial M2M networks requiring efficient handling of multi-priority traffic.

Abstract: Efficient medium access control (MAC) is critical for enabling low-latency
and reliable communication in industrial Machine-to-Machine (M2M) net-works,
where timely data delivery is essential for seamless operation. The presence of
multi-priority data in high-risk industrial environments further adds to the
challenges. The development of tens of MAC schemes over the past decade often
makes it a tough choice to deploy the most efficient solu-tion. Therefore, a
comprehensive cross-comparison of major MAC protocols across a range of
performance parameters appears necessary to gain deeper insights into their
relative strengths and limitations. This paper presents a comparison of
Contention window-based MAC scheme BoP-MAC with a fragmentation based,
FROG-MAC; both protocols focus on reducing the delay for higher priority
traffic, while taking a diverse approach. BoP-MAC assigns a differentiated
back-off value to the multi-priority traffic, whereas FROG-MAC enables early
transmission of higher-priority packets by fragmenting lower-priority traffic.
Simulations were performed on Contiki by varying the number of nodes for two
traffic priorities. It has been shown that when work-ing with multi-priority
heterogenous data in the industrial environment, FROG-MAC results better both
in terms of delay and throughput.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes coordination gain in ISAC systems using a compress-and-estimate framework, focusing on inference performance measured via discriminant gain (DG) rather than traditional MSE minimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether maximizing discriminant gain (DG) can yield better inference performance than minimizing mean squared error (MSE) in integrated sensing and communication systems, enabling more power-efficient transmission.

Method: Developed closed-form solutions for DG-optimal and MSE-optimal transceiver designs with water-filling-type structures, analyzing the explicit tradeoff between sensing and communication performance.

Result: Numerical experiments show DG-optimal design achieves more power-efficient transmission, particularly in low SNR regimes, by selectively allocating power to informative features and saving transmit power for sensing.

Conclusion: Maximizing discriminant gain provides superior inference performance and power efficiency compared to MSE minimization, especially in low SNR scenarios, with explicit tradeoffs between sensing and communication capabilities.

Abstract: This work is concerned with the coordination gain in integrated sensing and
communication (ISAC) systems under a compress-and-estimate (CE) framework,
wherein inference performance is leveraged as the key metric. To enable
tractable transceiver design and resource optimization, we characterize
inference performance via an error probability bound as a monotonic function of
the discriminant gain (DG). This raises the natural question of whether
maximizing DG, rather than minimizing mean squared error (MSE), can yield
better inference performance. Closed-form solutions for DG-optimal and
MSE-optimal transceiver designs are derived, revealing water-filling-type
structures and explicit sensing and communication (S\&C) tradeoff. Numerical
experiments confirm that DG-optimal design achieves more power-efficient
transmission, especially in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, by
selectively allocating power to informative features and thus saving transmit
power for sensing.

Conclusion: The work provides fundamental insights for modeling and utilizing dispersive effects of DMAs in next-generation near-field and far-field holographic sensing and computational holographic imaging applications.

Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) represent a novel approach to

flexible dispersion manipulation through dynamic holographic reconfigurability
of the meta-atoms in a DMA. This effect can create distinct radiation patterns
across the operating frequency band, achieving flexible frequency diversity

eliminates the need for wideband systems or complex phase-shifting networks

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Proposes A-MMMSE algorithm for WSR maximization in MU-MIMO systems, avoiding matrix inversions through block coordinate gradient descent for GPU acceleration, achieving comparable performance to WMMSE with reduced computational time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard WMMSE algorithm has cubic computational complexity due to matrix inversions, limiting its use in latency-sensitive scenarios.

Method: Block coordinate descent framework with gradient descent updates, avoiding matrix inversions using only matrix multiplications, plus two-stage warm-start strategy based on sum MSE minimization.

Result: Matches WSR performance of conventional WMMSE and reduced-WMMSE while achieving substantial computational time reduction across diverse system configurations.

Conclusion: A-MMMSE provides an efficient alternative to WMMSE for latency-sensitive MU-MIMO systems with GPU-friendly implementation and proven convergence to stationary points.

Abstract: Precoding design based on weighted sum-rate (WSR) maximization is a
fundamental problem in downlink multi-user multiple-input multiple-output
(MU-MIMO) systems. While the weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE)
algorithm is a standard solution, its high computational complexity--cubic in
the number of base station antennas due to matrix inversions--hinders its
application in latency-sensitive scenarios. To address this limitation, we
propose a highly parallel algorithm based on a block coordinate descent
framework. Our key innovation lies in updating the precoding matrix via block
coordinate gradient descent, which avoids matrix inversions and relies solely
on matrix multiplications, making it exceptionally amenable to GPU
acceleration. We prove that the proposed algorithm converges to a stationary
point of the WSR maximization problem. Furthermore, we introduce a two-stage
warm-start strategy grounded in the sum mean-square error (MSE) minimization
problem to accelerate convergence. We refer to our method as the Accelerated
Mixed weighted-unweighted sum-MSE minimization (A-MMMSE) algorithm. Simulation
results demonstrate that A-MMMSE matches the WSR performance of both
conventional WMMSE and its enhanced variant, reduced-WMMSE, while achieving a
substantial reduction in computational time across diverse system
configurations.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a theoretical framework using stochastic geometry to analyze LEO satellite-aided shore-to-ship communication networks, deriving analytical expressions for transmission success probability and rate capacity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional performance modeling based on multiple circular orbits is challenging for large-scale LEO satellite constellations, requiring a tractable approach to accurately evaluate network performance in maritime communications.

Method: Proposes a theoretical framework where LEO satellites are distributed as a binomial point process on a spherical surface, uses distance approximation for serving satellite position, and leverages stochastic geometry with threshold-based communication scheme.

Result: Derives analytical expressions for end-to-end transmission success probability and average transmission rate capacity, with extensive numerical results verifying accuracy and demonstrating key parameter effects.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides an accurate and tractable approach for evaluating LEO satellite-aided shore-to-ship communication network performance, addressing challenges in traditional modeling methods.

Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks have shown strategic superiority in
maritime communications, assisting in establishing signal transmissions from
shore to ship through space-based links. Traditional performance modeling based
on multiple circular orbits is challenging to characterize large-scale LEO
satellite constellations, thus requiring a tractable approach to accurately
evaluate the network performance. In this paper, we propose a theoretical
framework for an LEO satellite-aided shore-to-ship communication network
(LEO-SSCN), where LEO satellites are distributed as a binomial point process
(BPP) on a specific spherical surface. The framework aims to obtain the
end-to-end transmission performance by considering signal transmissions through
either a marine link or a space link subject to Rician or Shadowed Rician
fading, respectively. Due to the indeterminate position of the serving
satellite, accurately modeling the distance from the serving satellite to the
destination ship becomes intractable. To address this issue, we propose a
distance approximation approach. Then, by approximation and incorporating a
threshold-based communication scheme, we leverage stochastic geometry to derive
analytical expressions of end-to-end transmission success probability and
average transmission rate capacity. Extensive numerical results verify the
accuracy of the analysis and demonstrate the effect of key parameters on the
performance of LEO-SSCN.

*Jacob Ayers,Richard Hahnloser,Julia Ulrich,Lothar Sebastian Krapp,Remo Nitschke,Sabine Stoll,Balthasar Bickel,Reinhard Furrer*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for ranking time-series complexity using prediction error bounds derived from information theory, validated through synthetic experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a computationally tractable way to rank time-series complexity when direct computation of conditional differential entropy is intractable for high-dimensional processes.

Method: Leverages information theoretic prediction error bounds and Hadamard's inequality to upper bound conditional differential entropy using prediction error covariance matrices from next-step prediction models.

Result: The framework successfully ranks complexity in synthetic experiments with linear autoregressive processes and bio-inspired audio data, recovering known complexity orderings.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a theoretically grounded and computationally feasible approach for time-series complexity ranking using prediction errors.

Abstract: Conditional differential entropy provides an intuitive measure for relatively
ranking time-series complexity by quantifying uncertainty in future
observations given past context. However, its direct computation for
high-dimensional processes from unknown distributions is often intractable.
This paper builds on the information theoretic prediction error bounds
established by Fang et al. \cite{fang2019generic}, which demonstrate that the
conditional differential entropy \textbf{$h(X_k \mid X_{k-1},...,X_{k-m})$} is
upper bounded by a function of the determinant of the covariance matrix of
next-step prediction errors for any next step prediction model. We add to this
theoretical framework by further increasing this bound by leveraging Hadamard's
inequality and the positive semi-definite property of covariance matrices.
  To see if these bounds can be used to rank the complexity of time series, we
conducted two synthetic experiments: (1) controlled linear autoregressive
processes with additive Gaussian noise, where we compare ordinary least squares
prediction error entropy proxies to the true entropies of various additive
noises, and (2) a complexity ranking task of bio-inspired synthetic audio data
with unknown entropy, where neural network prediction errors are used to
recover the known complexity ordering.
  This framework provides a computationally tractable method for time-series
complexity ranking using prediction errors from next-step prediction models,
that maintains a theoretical foundation in information theory.

*Tadashi Wadayama*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: A gradient-based framework for optimizing parametric nonlinear Gaussian channels via mutual information maximization using score-to-Fisher bridge methodology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable practical parameter optimization of nonlinear front-ends in Gaussian channels without requiring explicit computation of output distributions.

Method: Uses score-to-Fisher bridge methodology to derive computationally tractable information gradient formula, combining score function learning via denoising score matching and Jacobian computation via vector-Jacobian product in automatic differentiation.

Result: Extensive experimental validation confirms correctness of the information gradient formula and demonstrates effectiveness in optimizing both linear and nonlinear channels.

Conclusion: The framework enables end-to-end optimization of nonlinear front-ends and extends to task-oriented scenarios including task-specific mutual information and information bottleneck objectives.

Abstract: We propose a gradient-based framework for optimizing parametric nonlinear
Gaussian channels via mutual information maximization. Leveraging the
score-to-Fisher bridge (SFB) methodology, we derive a computationally tractable
formula for the information gradient that is the gradient of mutual information
with respect to the parameters of the nonlinear front-end. Our formula
expresses this gradient in terms of two key components: the score function of
the marginal output distribution, which can be learned via denoising score
matching (DSM), and the Jacobian of the front-end function, which is handled
efficiently using the vector-Jacobian product (VJP) within automatic
differentiation frameworks. This enables practical parameter optimization
through gradient ascent. Furthermore, we extend this framework to task-oriented
scenarios, deriving gradients for both task-specific mutual information, where
a task variable depends on the channel input, and the information bottleneck
(IB) objective. A key advantage of our approach is that it facilitates
end-to-end optimization of the nonlinear front-end without requiring explicit
computation on the output distribution. Extensive experimental validation
confirms the correctness of our information gradient formula against analytical
solutions and demonstrates its effectiveness in optimizing both linear and
nonlinear channels toward their objectives.

*Xiang Li,Cheuk Ting Li*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: A framework called type deviation convergence for second-order achievability in network information theory, with improved bounds for Wyner-Ziv, Heegard-Berger, and Gelfand-Pinsker problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a general framework for second-order achievability analysis in network information theory, particularly for lossy source coding and channel coding with cost constraints, where existing bounds need improvement.

Method: Proposed type deviation convergence framework for second-order achievability analysis, applied to various network information theory settings including Wyner-Ziv, Heegard-Berger, and Gelfand-Pinsker problems with cost.

Result: Achieved improved second-order achievability bounds for Wyner-Ziv problem (better than Watanabe-Kuzuoka-Tan, Yassaee-Aref-Gohari, Li-Anantharam), and also improved bounds for Heegard-Berger and Gelfand-Pinsker problems with cost.

Conclusion: The type deviation convergence framework provides a general approach for second-order achievability analysis that yields improved performance bounds across multiple important problems in network information theory.

Abstract: We propose a framework for second-order achievability, called type deviation
convergence, that is generally applicable to settings in network information
theory, and is especially suitable for lossy source coding and channel coding
with cost. We give a second-order achievability bound for lossy source coding
with side information at the decoder (Wyner-Ziv problem) that improves upon all
known bounds (e.g., Watanabe-Kuzuoka-Tan, Yassaee-Aref-Gohari and
Li-Anantharam). We also give second-order achievability bounds for lossy
compression where side information may be absent (Heegard-Berger problem) and
channels with noncausal state information at the encoder and cost constraint
(Gelfand-Pinsker problem with cost) that improve upon previous bounds.

### [254] [A Location-Aware Hybrid Deep Learning Framework for Dynamic Near-Far Field Channel Estimation in Low-Altitude UAV Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20277)
*Wenli Yuan,Kan Yu,Xiaowu Liu,Kaixuan Li,Qixun Zhang,Zhiyong Feng*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: A hybrid deep learning framework for UAV channel estimation that combines CNNs, BiLSTMs, and attention mechanisms with geometric location priors to handle near-field effects in air-to-ground communications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional channel estimation methods fail in UAV communications due to dynamic air-to-ground links, high mobility, and hybrid near/far-field conditions from large antenna arrays, while ignoring valuable geometric position information.

Method: Proposes a location-aware hybrid deep learning architecture combining CNNs for spatial features, BiLSTMs for temporal modeling, and multi-head self-attention for focusing on discriminative channel components, with embedded real-time transceiver positions as geometric priors.

Result: Extensive simulations show the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing benchmarks, achieving at least 30.25% reduction in normalized mean square error (NMSE) on average.

Conclusion: The unified framework effectively addresses near-field channel estimation challenges in UAV communications by leveraging geometric priors and hybrid deep learning, demonstrating superior performance over conventional methods.

Abstract: In low altitude UAV communications, accurate channel estimation remains
challenging due to the dynamic nature of air to ground links, exacerbated by
high node mobility and the use of large scale antenna arrays, which introduce
hybrid near and far field propagation conditions. While conventional estimation
methods rely on far field assumptions, they fail to capture the intricate
channel variations in near-field scenarios and overlook valuable geometric
priors such as real-time transceiver positions. To overcome these limitations,
this paper introduces a unified channel estimation framework based on a
location aware hybrid deep learning architecture. The proposed model
synergistically combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for spatial
feature extraction, bidirectional long short term memory (BiLSTM) networks for
modeling temporal evolution, and a multihead self attention mechanism to
enhance focus on discriminative channel components. Furthermore, real-time
transmitter and receiver locations are embedded as geometric priors, improving
sensitivity to distance under near field spherical wavefronts and boosting
model generalization. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of the
proposed approach, showing that it outperforms existing benchmarks by a
significant margin, achieving at least a 30.25% reduction in normalized mean
square error (NMSE) on average.

*Wenxu Wang,Xiaowu Liu,Wei Gong,Yujia Zhao,Kaixuan Li,Qixun Zhang,Zhiyong Feng,Kan Yu*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: RoleAware-MAPP is a Transformer-based framework that addresses movable antenna positioning for physical layer security by incorporating domain knowledge through role-aware embeddings, physics-informed features, and a composite loss function, achieving significant improvements in secrecy performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in movable antenna deployment including high computational complexity, temporal mismatch between slow mechanical movement and rapid channel variations, and the limitations of existing learning approaches that overlook communication-specific domain knowledge and adversarial interactions between legitimate users and eavesdroppers.

Method: Reformulates MA positioning as a predictive task using a Transformer-based framework with three key components: role-aware embeddings to model user-specific intentions, physics-informed semantic features for channel propagation characteristics, and a composite loss function that prioritizes secrecy performance over geometric accuracy.

Result: Achieves an average secrecy rate of 0.3569 bps/Hz and a strictly positive secrecy capacity of 81.52%, outperforming the strongest baseline by 48.4% and 5.39 percentage points respectively, while maintaining robust performance across diverse user velocities and noise conditions.

Conclusion: RoleAware-MAPP successfully addresses the practical deployment challenges of movable antenna technology by incorporating domain knowledge and adversarial considerations, demonstrating significant improvements in physical layer security performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) technology provides a promising avenue for actively
shaping wireless channels through dynamic antenna positioning, thereby enabling
electromagnetic radiation reconstruction to enhance physical layer security
(PLS). However, its practical deployment is hindered by two major challenges:
the high computational complexity of real time optimization and a critical
temporal mismatch between slow mechanical movement and rapid channel
variations. Although data driven methods have been introduced to alleviate
online optimization burdens, they are still constrained by suboptimal training
labels derived from conventional solvers or high sample complexity in
reinforcement learning. More importantly, existing learning based approaches
often overlook communication-specific domain knowledge, particularly the
asymmetric roles and adversarial interactions between legitimate users and
eavesdroppers, which are fundamental to PLS. To address these issues, this
paper reformulates the MA positioning problem as a predictive task and
introduces RoleAware-MAPP, a novel Transformer based framework that
incorporates domain knowledge through three key components: role-aware
embeddings that model user specific intentions, physics-informed semantic
features that encapsulate channel propagation characteristics, and a composite
loss function that strategically prioritizes secrecy performance over mere
geometric accuracy. Extensive simulations under 3GPP-compliant scenarios show
that RoleAware-MAPP achieves an average secrecy rate of 0.3569 bps/Hz and a
strictly positive secrecy capacity of 81.52%, outperforming the strongest
baseline by 48.4% and 5.39 percentage points, respectively, while maintaining
robust performance across diverse user velocities and noise conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the ergodic mutual information and outage probability for SIM-assisted MIMO systems, which are not available in existing literature, and to demonstrate performance improvements over conventional MIMO and single-layer systems.

Method: Used large random matrix theory tools to obtain the distribution of mutual information, derived closed-form expressions for outage probability based on statistical CSI, and applied gradient descent method for outage probability minimization.

Result: Simulation results verified analytical derivations, showing performance enhancements compared to conventional MIMO systems and single-layer counterparts, with the proposed optimization algorithm being faster than alternating optimization benchmark.

Conclusion: The paper successfully analyzed SIM-assisted MIMO systems, providing fundamental insights and demonstrating significant performance improvements with reduced computational overhead compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) is a promising enabler for
next-generation high-capacity networks that exhibit better performance compared
to its single-layer counterpart by means of just wave propagation. However, the
study of ergodic mutual information (EMI) and outage probability for
SIM-assisted multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems is not available in
the literature. To this end, we obtain the distribution of the MI by using
large random matrix theory (RMT) tools. Next, we derive a tight closed-form
expression for the outage probability based on statistical channel state
information (CSI). Moreover, we apply the gradient descent method for the
minimization of the outage probability. Simulation results verify the
analytical results and provide fundamental insights such as the performance
enhancements compared to conventional MIMO systems and the single-layer
counterpart. Notably the proposed optimization algorithm is faster than the
alternating optimization (AO) benchmark by saving significant overhead.

### [257] [Robust Analog Lagrange Coded Computing: Theory and Algorithms via Discrete Fourier Transforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20379)
*Rimpi Borah,J. Harshan*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Proposes a secure Analog Lagrange Coded Computing framework with Byzantine resilience using DFT error-correction and novel task distribution strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vanilla ALCC preserves privacy and handles stragglers but is vulnerable to Byzantine workers returning erroneous results, creating integrity threats.

Method: Uses error-correction algorithms for DFT codes for reconstruction, develops novel task distribution strategies based on worker trust profiles, and analyzes collusion attacks exploiting floating-point precision noise.

Result: Significantly improves computational accuracy in presence of bounded Byzantine workers, especially when worker trust profiles are available.

Conclusion: The proposed secure ALCC framework provides robust Byzantine resilience while maintaining the privacy and straggler tolerance benefits of vanilla ALCC.

Abstract: Analog Lagrange Coded Computing (ALCC) is a recently proposed computational
paradigm wherein certain computations over analog datasets are efficiently
performed using distributed worker nodes through floating point representation.
While the vanilla version of ALCC is known to preserve the privacy of the
datasets from the workers and also achieve resilience against stragglers, it is
not robust against Byzantine workers that return erroneous results.
Highlighting this vulnerability, we propose a secure ALCC framework that is
resilient against a wide range of integrity threats from the Byzantine workers.
As a foundational step, we use error-correction algorithms for Discrete Fourier
Transform (DFT) codes to build novel reconstruction strategies for ALCC thereby
improving its computational accuracy in the presence of a bounded number of
Byzantine workers. Furthermore, capitalizing on some theoretical results on the
performance of the DFT decoders, we propose novel strategies for distributing
the ALCC computational tasks to the workers, and show that such methods
significantly improve the accuracy when the workers' trust profiles are
available at the master server. Finally, we study the robustness of the
proposed framework against colluding attacks, and show that interesting attack
strategies can be executed by exploiting the inherent precision noise owing to
floating point implementation.

*Mohamed Seif,Malcolm Egan,Andrea J. Goldsmith,H. Vincent Poor*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Proposes privacy-preserving AI sensing framework where edge devices transform features before transmission to protect sensitive data from reconstruction attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI sensing at edge devices needs feature communication between sensors and model servers, but raw features can expose sensitive personal data to adversaries through reconstruction attacks.

Method: Devices apply transformations to extracted features before transmission to model servers, providing privacy protection for individual features.

Result: Framework enables privacy-preserving AI-based sensing while maintaining functionality for prediction tasks like classification and regression.

Conclusion: The proposed approach addresses privacy risks in edge AI sensing by transforming features before communication, complementing existing differential privacy methods for finite datasets.

Abstract: AI-based sensing at wireless edge devices has the potential to significantly
enhance Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, particularly for vision and
perception tasks such as in autonomous driving and environmental monitoring. AI
systems rely both on efficient model learning and inference. In the inference
phase, features extracted from sensing data are utilized for prediction tasks
(e.g., classification or regression). In edge networks, sensors and model
servers are often not co-located, which requires communication of features. As
sensitive personal data can be reconstructed by an adversary, transformation of
the features are required to reduce the risk of privacy violations. While
differential privacy mechanisms provide a means of protecting finite datasets,
protection of individual features has not been addressed. In this paper, we
propose a novel framework for privacy-preserving AI-based sensing, where
devices apply transformations of extracted features before transmission to a
model server.

Result: Simulation results show fluid antenna systems significantly improve energy harvesting efficiency at the energy receiver compared to traditional fixed-position antennas.

Conclusion: Fluid antenna technology provides substantial benefits for energy harvesting in SWIPT systems, offering improved performance over conventional fixed-antenna approaches.

Abstract: Fluid antenna is a promising wireless communication technology that enhances
communication rate by changing the antenna positions. This article proposes a
new communication system that combines multiple-input single-output (MISO)
fluid antennas with traditional fixed-position antennas, utilizing antenna
position optimization to improve energy harvesting efficiency. In this model,
we consider simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) which
transmits identical signals from the base station to both information receiver
(IR) and energy receiver (ER). We strive to enhance the power delivered to the
ER by fine-tuning the positions of transmit and receive fluid antennas, along
with optimizing the transmit covariance matrix, subject to a given minimum
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint at the IR. Simulation
results indicate that fluid antenna systems significantly enhance the energy
harvesting efficiency of the ER compared to traditional fixed-position
antennas.

*Haiyang Wang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper studies the growth rate of support points in capacity-achieving input distributions for amplitude-constrained AWGN channels, showing super-linear growth with amplitude constraint A.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While it's known that optimal inputs are discrete with finite support points, tight bounds on how the number of support points K(A) grows with amplitude constraint A remain an open problem.

Method: Combines total-variation convergence of output distribution to uniform law with quantitative limits on Gaussian mixture approximation, building on recent work by Dytso et al. (2019) and Mattingly et al. (2018).

Result: Derived a new analytical lower bound showing that K(A) grows super-linearly in A, meaning faster than linear growth.

Conclusion: The number of support points in capacity-achieving distributions for amplitude-constrained AWGN channels exhibits super-linear growth with increasing amplitude constraints.

Abstract: We study the growth of the support size of the capacity-achieving input
distribution for the amplitude-constrained additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)
channel. While it is known since Smith (1971) that the optimal input is
discrete with finitely many mass points, tight bounds on the number of support
points $K(A)$ as the amplitude constraint $A$ increases remain open. Building
on recent work by Dytso \emph{et al.} (2019) and Mattingly \emph{et al.}
(2018), we derive a new analytical lower bound showing that $K(A)$ grows
super-linearly in $A$. Our approach combines total-variation convergence of the
output distribution to the uniform law with quantitative limits on Gaussian
mixture approximation.

TL;DR: Proposed spread pilot design and channel estimation method for MIMO-Zak-OTFS systems with superimposed pilots, using cross-ambiguity domain separation and turbo iterations to achieve good performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need effective pilot design and channel estimation for MIMO-Zak-OTFS systems where data and pilots are superimposed, requiring separation of pilot sequences from different transmit antennas at the receiver.

Method: Spread pilot design that separates pilot sequences in cross-ambiguity domain, enabling simple read-off channel estimation, combined with turbo iterations between channel estimation and detection to reduce pilot-data interference.

Result: Simulation results for 2×2 and 3×3 MIMO-Zak-OTFS with vehicular-A channel model show very good estimation/detection performance with three turbo iterations.

Conclusion: The proposed pilot design and estimation scheme with turbo iterations effectively handles MIMO-Zak-OTFS channel estimation with superimposed pilots, achieving strong performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of spread pilot design and effective
channel estimation in multiple-input multiple-output Zak-OTFS (MIMO-Zak-OTFS)
with superimposed spread pilots, where data and spread pilot signals are
superimposed in the same frame. To achieve good estimation performance in a
MIMO setting, the spread pilots at different transmit antennas need to be
effectively separated at the receiver. Towards this, we propose a spread pilot
design that separates the pilot sequences in the cross-ambiguity domain and
enables the estimation of the effective channel taps by a simple read-off
operation. To further alleviate the effect of pilot-data interference on
performance, we carry out turbo iterations between channel estimation and
detection. Simulation results for $2\times 2$ and $3\times 3$ MIMO-Zak-OTFS
with Gaussian-sinc pulse shaping filter for vehicular-A channel model show that
the proposed pilot design and estimation scheme with three turbo iterations can
achieve very good estimation/detection performance.
