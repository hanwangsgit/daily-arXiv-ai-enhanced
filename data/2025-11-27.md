### [1] [Are Neuro-Inspired Multi-Modal Vision-Language Models Resilient to Membership Inference Privacy Leakage?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20710)
*David Amebley,Sayanton Dibbo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a neuroscience-inspired topological regularization framework to enhance privacy resilience in multi-modal vision-language models against membership inference attacks, showing 24% reduction in attack success while maintaining model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-modal models introduce new privacy attack vectors, and while neuro-inspired approaches have shown resilience in unimodal systems against adversarial attacks, their effectiveness against privacy attacks in multi-modal models remains unexplored.

Method: A systematic neuroscience-inspired topological regularization (tau) framework is applied to three VLMs (BLIP, PaliGemma 2, ViT-GPT2) across three datasets (COCO, CC3M, NoCaps) to analyze resilience against image-text-based inference privacy attacks.

Result: NEURO VLMs with topological regularization showed 24% mean ROC-AUC drop in MIA attack success on BLIP with COCO dataset while maintaining similar model utility (MPNet and ROUGE-2 metrics). Results were consistent across other models and datasets.

Conclusion: Neuro-inspired VLMs are more resilient against privacy attacks without significantly compromising model utility, contributing to understanding privacy risks in multi-modal models and demonstrating neuro VLMs' privacy threat resilience.

Abstract: In the age of agentic AI, the growing deployment of multi-modal models (MMs) has introduced new attack vectors that can leak sensitive training data in MMs, causing privacy leakage. This paper investigates a black-box privacy attack, i.e., membership inference attack (MIA) on multi-modal vision-language models (VLMs). State-of-the-art research analyzes privacy attacks primarily to unimodal AI-ML systems, while recent studies indicate MMs can also be vulnerable to privacy attacks. While researchers have demonstrated that biologically inspired neural network representations can improve unimodal model resilience against adversarial attacks, it remains unexplored whether neuro-inspired MMs are resilient against privacy attacks. In this work, we introduce a systematic neuroscience-inspired topological regularization (tau) framework to analyze MM VLMs resilience against image-text-based inference privacy attacks. We examine this phenomenon using three VLMs: BLIP, PaliGemma 2, and ViT-GPT2, across three benchmark datasets: COCO, CC3M, and NoCaps. Our experiments compare the resilience of baseline and neuro VLMs (with topological regularization), where the tau > 0 configuration defines the NEURO variant of VLM. Our results on the BLIP model using the COCO dataset illustrate that MIA attack success in NEURO VLMs drops by 24% mean ROC-AUC, while achieving similar model utility (similarities between generated and reference captions) in terms of MPNet and ROUGE-2 metrics. This shows neuro VLMs are comparatively more resilient against privacy attacks, while not significantly compromising model utility. Our extensive evaluation with PaliGemma 2 and ViT-GPT2 models, on two additional datasets: CC3M and NoCaps, further validates the consistency of the findings. This work contributes to the growing understanding of privacy risks in MMs and provides evidence on neuro VLMs privacy threat resilience.

*Inferix Team,Tianyu Feng,Yizeng Han,Jiahao He,Yuanyu He,Xi Lin,Teng Liu,Hanfeng Lu,Jiasheng Tang,Wei Wang,Zhiyuan Wang,Jichao Wu,Mingyang Yang,Yinghao Yu,Zeyu Zhang,Bohan Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Inferix is a next-generation inference engine designed for world models that uses semi-autoregressive decoding to generate coherent, high-quality videos, distinguishing itself from high-concurrency systems and traditional video diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: World models are crucial for agentic AI, embodied AI, and gaming as they can generate realistic, interactive videos. Scaling these models could unlock emergent capabilities in visual perception and reasoning, moving beyond current LLM-centric vision foundation models.

Method: Inferix employs semi-autoregressive (block-diffusion) decoding, which combines diffusion and autoregressive methods by generating video tokens in blocks with diffusion within each block while conditioning on previous ones. It uses LLM-style KV Cache management for efficient, variable-length generation and includes interactive video streaming, profiling, and LV-Bench integration for benchmarking.

Result: The approach enables more coherent and stable video sequences, overcoming limitations of standard video diffusion. It supports efficient, high-quality generation of minute-long videos with real-time interaction capabilities.

Conclusion: Inferix is positioned as a dedicated engine for world simulation, distinct from other systems, and aims to advance world model exploration through community collaboration.

Abstract: World models serve as core simulators for fields such as agentic AI, embodied AI, and gaming, capable of generating long, physically realistic, and interactive high-quality videos. Moreover, scaling these models could unlock emergent capabilities in visual perception, understanding, and reasoning, paving the way for a new paradigm that moves beyond current LLM-centric vision foundation models. A key breakthrough empowering them is the semi-autoregressive (block-diffusion) decoding paradigm, which merges the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive methods by generating video tokens in block-applying diffusion within each block while conditioning on previous ones, resulting in more coherent and stable video sequences. Crucially, it overcomes limitations of standard video diffusion by reintroducing LLM-style KV Cache management, enabling efficient, variable-length, and high-quality generation.
  Therefore, Inferix is specifically designed as a next-generation inference engine to enable immersive world synthesis through optimized semi-autoregressive decoding processes. This dedicated focus on world simulation distinctly sets it apart from systems engineered for high-concurrency scenarios (like vLLM or SGLang) and from classic video diffusion models (such as xDiTs). Inferix further enhances its offering with interactive video streaming and profiling, enabling real-time interaction and realistic simulation to accurately model world dynamics. Additionally, it supports efficient benchmarking through seamless integration of LV-Bench, a new fine-grained evaluation benchmark tailored for minute-long video generation scenarios. We hope the community will work together to advance Inferix and foster world model exploration.

### [3] [Video Object Recognition in Mobile Edge Networks: Local Tracking or Edge Detection?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20716)
*Kun Guo,Yun Shen,Xijun Wang,Chaoqun You,Yun Rui,Tony Q. S. Quek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LTED-Ada is a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm that adaptively selects between local tracking and edge detection for video object recognition, with federated learning enhancement for multi-device scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Resource-constrained devices like traffic cameras struggle with fast and accurate video object recognition. While mobile edge computing enables offloading computation-intensive detection to edge servers, the challenge is deciding when to use edge detection versus local tracking.

Method: Formulated long-term optimization problems for single/multi-device scenarios, proposed LTED-Ada using deep reinforcement learning for adaptive selection between local tracking and edge detection, and enhanced with federated learning for multi-device collaborative policy training.

Result: Extensive hardware-in-the-loop experiments using Raspberry Pi 4B devices and PC edge server demonstrated the superiority of LTED-Ada in performance.

Conclusion: LTED-Ada effectively addresses the challenge of adaptive selection between local tracking and edge detection for video object recognition in resource-constrained environments, with federated learning improving generalization across devices.

Abstract: Fast and accurate video object recognition, which relies on frame-by-frame video analytics, remains a challenge for resource-constrained devices such as traffic cameras. Recent advances in mobile edge computing have made it possible to offload computation-intensive object detection to edge servers equipped with high-accuracy neural networks, while lightweight and fast object tracking algorithms run locally on devices. This hybrid approach offers a promising solution but introduces a new challenge: deciding when to perform edge detection versus local tracking. To address this, we formulate two long-term optimization problems for both single-device and multi-device scenarios, taking into account the temporal correlation of consecutive frames and the dynamic conditions of mobile edge networks. Based on the formulation, we propose the LTED-Ada in single-device setting, a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm that adaptively selects between local tracking and edge detection, according to the frame rate as well as recognition accuracy and delay requirement. In multi-device setting, we further enhance LTED-Ada using federated learning to enable collaborative policy training across devices, thereby improving its generalization to unseen frame rates and performance requirements. Finally, we conduct extensive hardware-in-the-loop experiments using multiple Raspberry Pi 4B devices and a personal computer as the edge server, demonstrating the superiority of LTED-Ada.

### [4] [DeeAD: Dynamic Early Exit of Vision-Language Action for Efficient Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20720)
*Haibo HU,Lianming Huang,Nan Guan,Chun Jason Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeeAD is a training-free early-exit framework that accelerates Vision-Language Action models for autonomous driving by terminating inference when trajectories align with lightweight planning priors, achieving 29% latency reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Action models suffer from significant inference latency due to deep transformer stacks, which limits their practical deployment in autonomous driving applications.

Method: Uses action-guided early-exit with physical feasibility evaluation of intermediate trajectories, a multi-hop controller for adaptive layer skipping, and integrates with existing VLA models without retraining.

Result: Achieves up to 28% transformer-layer sparsity and 29% latency reduction on Bench2Drive benchmark while preserving planning quality and safety.

Conclusion: DeeAD provides an effective training-free solution to accelerate VLA planning models without compromising performance or safety.

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models unify perception, reasoning, and trajectory generation for autonomous driving, but suffer from significant inference latency due to deep transformer stacks. We present DeeAD, a training-free, action-guided early-exit framework that accelerates VLA planning by evaluating the physical feasibility of intermediate trajectories. Instead of relying on confidence scores, DeeAD terminates inference when predicted trajectories align with lightweight planning priors (e.g., Navigation or Low-precision Planning) within a tolerable deviation (<2m). To improve efficiency, we introduce a multi-hop controller that adaptively skips redundant layers based on the change rate of scores. DeeAD integrates into existing VLA models, such as ORION, without requiring retraining. Experiments on the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate up to 28% transformer-layer sparsity and 29% latency reduction, while preserving planning quality and safety.

### [5] [Foundry: Distilling 3D Foundation Models for the Edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20721)
*Guillaume Letellier,Siddharth Srivastava,Frédéric Jurie,Gaurav Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FMD compresses large SSL foundation models into compact proxies that retain general-purpose representational power, with Foundry as the first implementation for 3D point clouds using SuperTokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large foundation models are too computationally expensive for edge devices, and existing compression methods sacrifice the crucial generality that makes foundation models valuable.

Method: Foundry trains a student model to learn compressed SuperTokens that reconstruct the teacher's token-level representations, capturing a compact basis of the latent space.

Result: A single distilled model maintains strong transferability across diverse downstream tasks (classification, part segmentation, few-shot scenarios), approaching full foundation-model performance with significantly fewer tokens and FLOPs.

Conclusion: FMD enables practical deployment of foundation models on resource-constrained hardware while preserving their general-purpose capabilities.

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained with self-supervised learning (SSL) on large-scale datasets have become powerful general-purpose feature extractors. However, their immense size and computational cost make them prohibitive for deployment on edge devices such as robots and AR/VR headsets. Existing compression techniques like standard knowledge distillation create efficient 'specialist' models but sacrifice the crucial, downstream-agnostic generality that makes foundation models so valuable.  In this paper, we introduce Foundation Model Distillation (FMD), a new paradigm for compressing large SSL models into compact, efficient, and faithful proxies that retain their general-purpose representational power. We present Foundry, the first implementation of FMD for 3D point clouds. Our approach, Foundry, trains a student to learn a compressed set of SuperTokens that reconstruct the teacher's token-level representations, capturing a compact basis of its latent space. A single distilled model maintains strong transferability across diverse downstream tasks-classification, part segmentation, and few-shot scenarios-approaching full foundation-model performance while using significantly fewer tokens and FLOPs, making such models more practical for deployment on resourceconstrained hardware.

### [6] [DinoLizer: Learning from the Best for Generative Inpainting Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20722)
*Minh Thong Doi,Jan Butora,Vincent Itier,Jérémie Boulanger,Patrick Bas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DinoLizer is a DINOv2-based model for detecting manipulated regions in generative inpainting, using patch-level classification and sliding-window aggregation to achieve state-of-the-art localization performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an effective method for localizing manipulated regions in generative inpainting that can distinguish semantic alterations from non-semantic edits and remain robust to common post-processing operations.

Method: Uses DINOv2 pretrained on B-Free dataset with added linear classification head on patch embeddings, sliding-window strategy for larger images, and post-processing to refine binary manipulation masks.

Result: Achieves 12% higher IoU than next best model, remains robust to resizing, noise addition, and JPEG compression, and shows superiority over DINOv3 in ablation studies.

Conclusion: DINOv2-based Vision Transformers demonstrate strong representational power for manipulation localization, with DinoLizer outperforming state-of-the-art methods across various inpainting datasets.

Abstract: We introduce DinoLizer, a DINOv2-based model for localizing manipulated regions in generative inpainting. Our method builds on a DINOv2 model pretrained to detect synthetic images on the B-Free dataset. We add a linear classification head on top of the Vision Transformer's patch embeddings to predict manipulations at a $14\times 14$ patch resolution. The head is trained to focus on semantically altered regions, treating non-semantic edits as part of the original content. Because the ViT accepts only fixed-size inputs, we use a sliding-window strategy to aggregate predictions over larger images; the resulting heatmaps are post-processed to refine the estimated binary manipulation masks. Empirical results show that DinoLizer surpasses state-of-the-art local manipulation detectors on a range of inpainting datasets derived from different generative models. It remains robust to common post-processing operations such as resizing, noise addition, and JPEG (double) compression. On average, DinoLizer achieves a 12\% higher Intersection-over-Union (IoU) than the next best model, with even greater gains after post-processing. Our experiments with off-the-shelf DINOv2 demonstrate the strong representational power of Vision Transformers for this task. Finally, extensive ablation studies comparing DINOv2 and its successor, DINOv3, in deepfake localization confirm DinoLizer's superiority. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.

### [7] [CANVAS: A Benchmark for Vision-Language Models on Tool-Based User Interface Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20737)
*Daeheon Jeong,Seoyeon Byun,Kihoon Son,Dae Hyun Kim,Juho Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CANVAS is a benchmark for evaluating vision language models' ability to perform tool-based UI design tasks through iterative software interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: No existing benchmark evaluates VLMs' capacity to operate design software for UI editing, which is important for understanding their potential to collaborate with designers in conventional workflows.

Method: Created CANVAS benchmark with 598 tool-based design tasks from 3.3K mobile UI designs across 30 categories, featuring design replication and modification tasks where VLMs update designs through context-based tool invocations linked to design software.

Result: Leading models demonstrate more strategic tool invocations that improve design quality, and common error patterns were identified to guide future improvements.

Conclusion: CANVAS enables systematic evaluation of VLMs' tool-based UI design capabilities, revealing current performance levels and providing direction for enhancing these collaborative design abilities.

Abstract: User interface (UI) design is an iterative process in which designers progressively refine their work with design software such as Figma or Sketch. Recent advances in vision language models (VLMs) with tool invocation suggest these models can operate design software to edit a UI design through iteration. Understanding and enhancing this capacity is important, as it highlights VLMs' potential to collaborate with designers within conventional software. However, as no existing benchmark evaluates tool-based design performance, the capacity remains unknown. To address this, we introduce CANVAS, a benchmark for VLMs on tool-based user interface design. Our benchmark contains 598 tool-based design tasks paired with ground-truth references sampled from 3.3K mobile UI designs across 30 function-based categories (e.g., onboarding, messaging). In each task, a VLM updates the design step-by-step through context-based tool invocations (e.g., create a rectangle as a button background), linked to design software. Specifically, CANVAS incorporates two task types: (i) design replication evaluates the ability to reproduce a whole UI screen; (ii) design modification evaluates the ability to modify a specific part of an existing screen. Results suggest that leading models exhibit more strategic tool invocations, improving design quality. Furthermore, we identify common error patterns models exhibit, guiding future work in enhancing tool-based design capabilities.

### [8] [Text-Guided Semantic Image Encoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20770)
*Raghuveer Thirukovalluru,Xiaochuang Han,Bhuwan Dhingra,Emily Dinan,Maha Elbayad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TIE is a text-guided semantic image encoder that generates image representations conditioned on text queries, improving vision-language model performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard image encoders in VLMs process images agnostically without considering downstream tasks or text queries, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Proposed Text-Guided Semantic Image Encoder (TIE) that generates image representations conditioned on input text queries through text-conditioned training.

Result: TIE-based VLMs outperform conventional counterparts by +1.5 and +1.3 points on average across nine benchmarks at 1B and 3B scales, with up to 6-point gains on DocVQA and InfoVQA, while using only half the image tokens.

Conclusion: TIE effectively optimizes encoders to capture key visual features, improves interpretability through query-specific attention, and enhances both performance and inference efficiency.

Abstract: Image encoders, a fundamental component of vision-language models (VLMs), are typically pretrained independently before being aligned with a language model. This standard paradigm results in encoders that process images agnostically, without regard to the specific downstream task or text query. To address this limitation, we propose the Text-Guided Semantic Image Encoder (TIE), which generates image representations conditioned on the input text query. VLMs equipped with TIE outperform their conventional counterparts by +1.5 and +1.3 points on average across nine image-to-text benchmarks at the 1B and 3B scales, respectively, with gains reaching up to 6 points on tasks such as DocVQA and InfoVQA. Moreover, TIE-based VLMs attain superior performance while utilizing only half as many image tiles (tokens), resulting in notably improved inference efficiency. TIE also generalizes well with generic queries, indicating that text-conditioned training effectively optimizes the encoder to capture key visual features. Qualitative analysis confirms that TIE consistently attends to query-relevant regions, enhancing both interpretability and query-specific grounding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SMARC is a unified model that reconstructs full RGB surfaces and classifies material categories from just a single 10% contiguous image patch, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods require dense or full-scene observations, limiting their effectiveness in constrained environments with partial views. There's a need for models that can work with minimal visual input.

Method: Combines a Partial Convolutional U-Net with a classification head, enabling spatial inpainting and semantic understanding under extreme observation sparsity from only 10% of image data.

Result: Achieves PSNR of 17.55 dB for surface reconstruction and 85.10% accuracy for material classification, outperforming five baseline models including ViT, MAE, Swin Transformer, and DETR.

Conclusion: Partial convolution provides significant advantages for spatial reasoning with missing data, establishing a strong foundation for minimal-vision surface understanding applications.

Abstract: Understanding material surfaces from sparse visual cues is critical for applications in robotics, simulation, and material perception. However, most existing methods rely on dense or full-scene observations, limiting their effectiveness in constrained or partial view environment. To address this challenge, we introduce SMARC, a unified model for Surface MAterial Reconstruction and Classification from minimal visual input. By giving only a single 10% contiguous patch of the image, SMARC recognizes and reconstructs the full RGB surface while simultaneously classifying the material category. Our architecture combines a Partial Convolutional U-Net with a classification head, enabling both spatial inpainting and semantic understanding under extreme observation sparsity. We compared SMARC against five models including convolutional autoencoders [17], Vision Transformer (ViT) [13], Masked Autoencoder (MAE) [5], Swin Transformer [9], and DETR [2] using Touch and Go dataset [16] of real-world surface textures. SMARC achieves state-of-the-art results with a PSNR of 17.55 dB and a material classification accuracy of 85.10%. Our findings highlight the advantages of partial convolution in spatial reasoning under missing data and establish a strong foundation for minimal-vision surface understanding.

### [10] [LongVT: Incentivizing "Thinking with Long Videos" via Native Tool Calling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20785)
*Zuhao Yang,Sudong Wang,Kaichen Zhang,Keming Wu,Sicong Leng,Yifan Zhang,Chengwei Qin,Shijian Lu,Xingxuan Li,Lidong Bing*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongVT is an agentic framework that enables multimodal reasoning on long videos through iterative global-to-local analysis using temporal grounding as a native cropping tool, addressing hallucination issues in large multimodal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large multimodal models struggle with hallucinations when processing long-form videos where evidence is sparse and temporally dispersed, unlike humans who skim globally and examine relevant clips for details.

Method: Uses LMMs' temporal grounding ability as a native video cropping tool to zoom in on specific clips and resample finer-grained frames in a global-to-local reasoning loop until answers are grounded in visual evidence.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines across four challenging long-video understanding benchmarks through a three-stage training strategy using curated datasets.

Conclusion: LongVT provides an effective framework for long video reasoning that reduces hallucinations by mimicking human comprehension patterns through interleaved multimodal chain-of-tool-thought.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown great potential for video reasoning with textual Chain-of-Thought. However, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, especially when processing long-form videos where evidence is sparse and temporally dispersed. Inspired by how humans comprehend long videos - by first skimming globally and then examining relevant clips for details - we introduce LongVT, an end-to-end agentic framework that enables "Thinking with Long Videos" via interleaved Multimodal Chain-of-Tool-Thought. Specifically, we exploit LMMs' inherent temporal grounding ability as a native video cropping tool to zoom in on a specific video clip and resample finer-grained video frames. This global-to-local reasoning loop continues until answers are grounded in retrieved visual evidence. Given the scarcity of fine-grained question-answering (QA) data for the long video reasoning task, we curate and will release a data suite named VideoSIAH to facilitate both training and evaluation. Specifically, our training dataset consists of 247.9K samples for tool-integrated cold-start supervised fine-tuning, 1.6K samples for agentic reinforcement learning, and 15.4K samples for agentic reinforcement fine-tuning, respectively. Our evaluation benchmark consists of 1,280 QA pairs that are carefully curated through a semi-automatic data pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation. With a meticulously designed three-stage training strategy and extensive empirical validation, LongVT consistently outperforms existing strong baselines across four challenging long-video understanding and reasoning benchmarks. Our codes, data, and model checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/LongVT .

### [11] [Revisiting KRISP: A Lightweight Reproduction and Analysis of Knowledge-Enhanced Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20795)
*Souradeep Dutta,Keshav Bulia,Neena S Nair*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lightweight reproduction of KRISP with fewer parameters, achieving 75% of original performance while revealing design flaws and enabling edge device deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a more efficient version of KRISP that addresses computational demands and tight coupling with large backbones, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments.

Method: Systematic replication with reduced parameters, systematic ablation studies, proof-of-concept on synthetic VQA data, and evaluation on DAQUAR dataset with constrained knowledge graph domain.

Result: Achieved 75% of original KRISP performance while preventing AI hallucinations and enabling operation on edge devices like smartphones and AR-VR.

Conclusion: The lightweight reproduction uncovers design flaws in the original KRISP while demonstrating feasibility of knowledge-enhanced VQA under resource constraints, with practical applications for offline visual reasoning.

Abstract: Facebook AI Research introduced KRISP [4], which integrates structured external knowledge into pipelines for vision-language reasoning. Despite its effectiveness, the original model has been developed for industrial-scale training, is computationally demanding, and is tightly connected to a large backbone. In this work, we reexamine KRISP from a different angle and offer a lightweight reproduction with significantly fewer parameters. Even though our replicated model performs about 75 % of the original, the replication process uncovers a number of design flaws, real-world pitfalls, and implicit problems that were not fully covered in the original paper. We offer insights into the scalability and efficacy of knowledge-enhanced VQA architectures under resource constraints through systematic ablation studies, which include a proof-of-concept on synthetic VQA data and evaluation on the DAQUAR dataset. Our model, configured with a low parameter setup and constrained by the external Knowledge graph domain, prevents AI hallucinations and generates outputs solely within that domain. Minimal parameters allow us to function on edge devices like smartphones and AR-VR, further improving offline visual reasoning.

*Nisarg K. Trivedi,Vinayak A. Belludi,Li-Yun Wang,Pardis Taghavi,Dante Lok*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Presents first high-resolution stereo DSLR dataset with 18,000 images, systematically varying focal length and aperture across real scenes to bridge realism gap between synthetic training data and real camera optics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of large-scale, high-fidelity real stereo DSLR datasets limits real-world generalization and evaluation of depth estimation models trained on synthetic data.

Method: Captured 18,000 high-resolution (5472x3648px) stereo images across 9 scenes with varying complexity, using two identical camera assemblies at 10 focal lengths (28-70mm) and 5 apertures (f/2.8-f/22), spanning 50 optical configurations per scene.

Result: Dataset enables controlled analysis of geometric and optical effects for monocular/stereo depth estimation, depth-of-field rendering, deblurring, 3D reconstruction, and novel view synthesis, while demonstrating challenges with current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Bridges realism gap between synthetic training data and real camera optics, supporting reproducible research on real-world optical generalization through released dataset, calibration files, and evaluation code.

Abstract: Reliable depth estimation under real optical conditions remains a core challenge for camera vision in systems such as autonomous robotics and augmented reality. Despite recent progress in depth estimation and depth-of-field rendering, research remains constrained by the lack of large-scale, high-fidelity, real stereo DSLR datasets, limiting real-world generalization and evaluation of models trained on synthetic data as shown extensively in literature. We present the first high-resolution (5472$\times$3648px) stereo DSLR dataset with 18000 images, systematically varying focal length and aperture across complex real scenes and capturing the optical realism and complexity of professional camera systems. For 9 scenes with varying scene complexity, lighting and background, images are captured with two identical camera assemblies at 10 focal lengths (28-70mm) and 5 apertures (f/2.8-f/22), spanning 50 optical configurations in 2000 images per scene. This full-range optics coverage enables controlled analysis of geometric and optical effects for monocular and stereo depth estimation, shallow depth-of-field rendering, deblurring, 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Each focal configuration has a dedicated calibration image set, supporting evaluation of classical and learning based methods for intrinsic and extrinsic calibration. The dataset features challenging visual elements such as multi-scale optical illusions, reflective surfaces, mirrors, transparent glass walls, fine-grained details, and natural / artificial ambient light variations. This work attempts to bridge the realism gap between synthetic training data and real camera optics, and demonstrates challenges with the current state-of-the-art monocular, stereo depth and depth-of-field methods. We release the dataset, calibration files, and evaluation code to support reproducible research on real-world optical generalization.

### [13] [Intriguing Properties of Dynamic Sampling Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20800)
*Dario Morle,Reid Zaffino*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper develops a unified theoretical framework called 'warping' that generalizes dynamic sampling methods in deep learning, analyzes their statistical properties, and reveals unique training asymmetries between forward and backward passes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify the theoretical analysis of various dynamic sampling mechanisms in computer vision models, which have demonstrated utility but lack unified theoretical understanding.

Method: Developed a novel 'warping' operator that generalizes existing dynamic sampling methods, conducted statistical analysis modeling inputs as IID variables and homogeneous random fields, and introduced gradient-based loss landscape visualization.

Result: Discovered unique asymmetry between forward and backward passes in training, identified dynamic sampling as orthogonal to traditional convolution operators, established conditions for stable training, and analyzed discretization effects.

Conclusion: The warping framework provides a unified theoretical foundation for dynamic sampling methods, enabling better understanding of their behavior and establishing conditions for stable training in deep learning architectures.

Abstract: Dynamic sampling mechanisms in deep learning architectures have demonstrated utility across many computer vision models, though the theoretical analysis of these structures has not yet been unified. In this paper we connect the various dynamic sampling methods by developing and analyzing a novel operator which generalizes existing methods, which we term "warping". Warping provides a minimal implementation of dynamic sampling which is amenable to analysis, and can be used to reconstruct existing architectures including deformable convolutions, active convolutional units, and spatial transformer networks. Using our formalism, we provide statistical analysis of the operator by modeling the inputs as both IID variables and homogeneous random fields. Extending this analysis, we discover a unique asymmetry between the forward and backward pass of the model training. We demonstrate that these mechanisms represent an entirely different class of orthogonal operators to the traditional translationally invariant operators defined by convolutions. With a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical investigation, we find the conditions necessary to ensure stable training of dynamic sampling networks. In addition, statistical analysis of discretization effects are studied. Finally, we introduce a novel loss landscape visualization which utilizes gradient update information directly, to better understand learning behavior.

*Kriti Ghosh,Devjyoti Chakraborty,Lakshmish Ramaswamy,Suchendra M. Bhandarkar,In Kee Kim,Nancy O'Hare,Deepak Mishra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Δ-NeRF is a modular residual framework for incremental refinement of Neural Radiance Fields that enables efficient updates without catastrophic forgetting, achieving comparable performance to joint training while reducing training time by 30-42%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NeRF frameworks require complete retraining for new views, limiting applicability in sequential data scenarios like satellite terrain analysis where regions are repeatedly observed over time.

Method: Proposes a residual controller for per-layer corrections in frozen base NeRF, uncertainty-aware gating to prevent overcorrection, view selection to reduce training data by 47%, and knowledge distillation for model compression.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to joint training with 30-42% faster training, up to 43.5% PSNR improvement over naive fine-tuning, and surpasses joint training on some metrics while compressing model to 20% of original size.

Conclusion: Δ-NeRF provides an effective solution for incremental NeRF refinement that overcomes catastrophic forgetting and enables efficient updates in sequential data scenarios.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, most existing NeRF frameworks require complete retraining when new views are introduced incrementally, limiting their applicability in domains where data arrives sequentially. This limitation is particularly problematic in satellite-based terrain analysis, where regions are repeatedly observed over time. Incremental refinement of NeRFs remains underexplored, and naive approaches suffer from catastrophic forgetting when past data is unavailable. We propose $Δ$-NeRF, a unique modular residual framework for incremental NeRF refinement. $Δ$-NeRF introduces several novel techniques including: (1) a residual controller that injects per-layer corrections into a frozen base NeRF, enabling refinement without access to past data; (2) an uncertainty-aware gating mechanism that prevents overcorrection by adaptively combining base and refined predictions; and (3) a view selection strategy that reduces training data by up to 47\% while maintaining performance. Additionally, we employ knowledge distillation to compress the enhanced model into a compact student network (20\% of original size). Experiments on satellite imagery demonstrate that $Δ$-NeRF achieves performance comparable to joint training while reducing training time by 30-42\%. $Δ$-NeRF consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving an improvement of up to 43.5\% in PSNR over naive fine-tuning and surpassing joint training on some metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Split-then-Merge (StM) is a novel framework that enhances control in generative video composition by splitting unlabeled videos into foreground/background layers and self-composing them to learn compositional dynamics, addressing data scarcity without annotated datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the data scarcity problem in generative video composition and enhance control over dynamic subject-scene interactions without relying on annotated datasets or handcrafted rules.

Method: Splits unlabeled videos into dynamic foreground and background layers, then self-composes them with transformation-aware training using multi-layer fusion, augmentation for affordance-aware composition, and identity-preservation loss to maintain foreground fidelity.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative benchmarks and human/VLLM-based qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: StM effectively learns complex compositional dynamics for realistic video generation through self-supervised learning from unlabeled video data, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: We present Split-then-Merge (StM), a novel framework designed to enhance control in generative video composition and address its data scarcity problem. Unlike conventional methods relying on annotated datasets or handcrafted rules, StM splits a large corpus of unlabeled videos into dynamic foreground and background layers, then self-composes them to learn how dynamic subjects interact with diverse scenes. This process enables the model to learn the complex compositional dynamics required for realistic video generation. StM introduces a novel transformation-aware training pipeline that utilizes a multi-layer fusion and augmentation to achieve affordance-aware composition, alongside an identity-preservation loss that maintains foreground fidelity during blending. Experiments show StM outperforms SoTA methods in both quantitative benchmarks and in humans/VLLM-based qualitative evaluations.

*Samuele Dell'Erba,Andrew D. Bagdanov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OVI replaces expensive diffusion prior networks with optimization-based visual inversion, using text embedding similarity and regularization constraints to generate images without training or data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge the necessity of computationally expensive trained prior networks in diffusion models by proposing a training-free, data-free alternative.

Method: Optimization-based Visual Inversion (OVI) initializes latent representations from random pseudo-tokens and optimizes them using cosine similarity with text embeddings, with Mahalanobis and Nearest-Neighbor constraints for regularization.

Result: OVI serves as viable alternative to traditional priors, with Nearest-Neighbor approach achieving comparable or higher scores than state-of-the-art data-efficient prior, while revealing flaws in current evaluation benchmarks.

Conclusion: OVI demonstrates that trained priors may not be necessary, with constrained optimization methods showing promising results that merit further investigation.

Abstract: Diffusion models have established the state-of-the-art in text-to-image generation, but their performance often relies on a diffusion prior network to translate text embeddings into the visual manifold for easier decoding. These priors are computationally expensive and require extensive training on massive datasets. In this work, we challenge the necessity of a trained prior at all by employing Optimization-based Visual Inversion (OVI), a training-free and data-free alternative, to replace the need for a prior. OVI initializes a latent visual representation from random pseudo-tokens and iteratively optimizes it to maximize the cosine similarity with input textual prompt embedding. We further propose two novel constraints, a Mahalanobis-based and a Nearest-Neighbor loss, to regularize the OVI optimization process toward the distribution of realistic images. Our experiments, conducted on Kandinsky 2.2, show that OVI can serve as an alternative to traditional priors. More importantly, our analysis reveals a critical flaw in current evaluation benchmarks like T2I-CompBench++, where simply using the text embedding as a prior achieves surprisingly high scores, despite lower perceptual quality. Our constrained OVI methods improve visual fidelity over this baseline, with the Nearest-Neighbor approach proving particularly effective, achieving quantitative scores comparable to or higher than the state-of-the-art data-efficient prior, indicating that the idea merits further investigation. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RefTr is a 3D image-to-graph model for vascular tree centerline generation that uses recurrent refinement of confluent trajectories with a Producer-Refiner architecture, achieving superior recall and comparable precision to previous state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate detection of tubular tree centerlines with correct topology is critical for clinical applications like diagnosis and surgical navigation, where missing small branches can lead to fatal mistakes due to incomplete assessments.

Method: Uses a Producer-Refiner architecture based on Transformer decoder, where Producer proposes initial confluent trajectories and Refiner recurrently refines them to form centerline graphs. Introduces efficient non-maximum suppression for spatial tree graphs to merge duplicate branches.

Result: Achieves superior recall and comparable precision to previous SOTA across multiple public datasets, with 2.4x reduction in decoder parameters and faster inference.

Conclusion: RefTr demonstrates potential as a new state-of-the-art framework for vascular tree analysis in 3D medical imaging, offering improved performance with fewer parameters and faster processing.

Abstract: Tubular trees, such as blood vessels and lung airways, are essential for material transport within the human body. Accurately detecting their centerlines with correct tree topology is critical for clinical tasks such as diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical navigation. In these applications, maintaining high recall is crucial, as missing small branches can result in fatal mistakes caused by incomplete assessments or undetected abnormalities. We present RefTr, a 3D image-to-graph model for centerline generation of vascular trees via recurrent refinement of confluent trajectories. RefTr uses a Producer-Refiner architecture based on a Transformer decoder, where the Producer proposes a set of initial confluent trajectories that are recurrently refined by the Refiner to produce final trajectories, which forms the centerline graph. The confluent trajectory representation enables refinement of complete trajectories while explicitly enforcing a valid tree topology. The recurrent refinement scheme improves precision and reuses the same Refiner block across multiple steps, yielding a 2.4x reduction in decoder parameters compared to previous SOTA. We also introduce an efficient non-maximum suppression algorithm for spatial tree graphs to merge duplicate branches and boost precision. Across multiple public centerline datasets, RefTr achieves superior recall and comparable precision to previous SOTA, while offering faster inference and substantially fewer parameters, demonstrating its potential as a new state-of-the-art framework for vascular tree analysis in 3D medical imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first large-scale unsupervised dataset for visual memorability using 82,000+ videos with recall descriptions from online tip-of-the-tongue queries, enabling improved recall generation and multimodal retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual memorability datasets are limited by expensive human annotations, lack diversity and scalability, and only capture aggregate scores rather than nuanced memorability signals from natural recall descriptions.

Method: Leveraged tip-of-the-tongue retrieval queries from online platforms like Reddit to create an unsupervised dataset, then fine-tuned large vision-language models and used contrastive training for multimodal ToT retrieval.

Result: Models fine-tuned on the dataset outperform GPT-4o in generating open-ended memorability descriptions, and the contrastive training created the first model capable of multimodal ToT retrieval.

Conclusion: The unsupervised dataset and models provide a novel direction for visual memorability research, offering rich signals for recall generation and retrieval tasks while overcoming annotation limitations.

Abstract: Visual content memorability has intrigued the scientific community for decades, with applications ranging widely, from understanding nuanced aspects of human memory to enhancing content design. A significant challenge in progressing the field lies in the expensive process of collecting memorability annotations from humans. This limits the diversity and scalability of datasets for modeling visual content memorability. Most existing datasets are limited to collecting aggregate memorability scores for visual content, not capturing the nuanced memorability signals present in natural, open-ended recall descriptions. In this work, we introduce the first large-scale unsupervised dataset designed explicitly for modeling visual memorability signals, containing over 82,000 videos, accompanied by descriptive recall data. We leverage tip-of-the-tongue (ToT) retrieval queries from online platforms such as Reddit. We demonstrate that our unsupervised dataset provides rich signals for two memorability-related tasks: recall generation and ToT retrieval. Large vision-language models fine-tuned on our dataset outperform state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o in generating open-ended memorability descriptions for visual content. We also employ a contrastive training strategy to create the first model capable of performing multimodal ToT retrieval. Our dataset and models present a novel direction, facilitating progress in visual content memorability research.

### [20] [Estimating Fog Parameters from a Sequence of Stereo Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20865)
*Yining Ding,João F. C. Mota,Andrew M. Wallace,Sen Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a method for estimating fog parameters from stereo images using simultaneous optimization, handles inhomogeneous fog, and introduces the SDIRF dataset for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods estimate fog parameters sequentially, leading to error propagation. Real-world fog is often globally inhomogeneous, requiring better parameter estimation approaches.

Method: Simultaneous optimization of all fog parameters using stereo foggy images, assuming locally homogeneous fog. Can be integrated as a module in existing SLAM/odometry systems.

Result: Superior performance on both synthetic and real foggy data (SDIRF dataset), producing more accurate estimates and better adaptation to real fog conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively handles real-world inhomogeneous fog and advances visual perception research in foggy conditions. Code and dataset are publicly available.

Abstract: We propose a method which, given a sequence of stereo foggy images, estimates the parameters of a fog model and updates them dynamically. In contrast with previous approaches, which estimate the parameters sequentially and thus are prone to error propagation, our algorithm estimates all the parameters simultaneously by solving a novel optimisation problem. By assuming that fog is only locally homogeneous, our method effectively handles real-world fog, which is often globally inhomogeneous. The proposed algorithm can be easily used as an add-on module in existing visual Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) or odometry systems in the presence of fog. In order to assess our method, we also created a new dataset, the Stereo Driving In Real Fog (SDIRF), consisting of high-quality, consecutive stereo frames of real, foggy road scenes under a variety of visibility conditions, totalling over 40 minutes and 34k frames. As a first-of-its-kind, SDIRF contains the camera's photometric parameters calibrated in a lab environment, which is a prerequisite for correctly applying the atmospheric scattering model to foggy images. The dataset also includes the counterpart clear data of the same routes recorded in overcast weather, which is useful for companion work in image defogging and depth reconstruction. We conducted extensive experiments using both synthetic foggy data and real foggy sequences from SDIRF to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over prior methods. Our method not only produces the most accurate estimates on synthetic data, but also adapts better to real fog. We make our code and SDIRF publicly available\footnote{https://github.com/SenseRoboticsLab/estimating-fog-parameters} to the community with the aim of advancing the research on visual perception in fog.

TL;DR: V^2-SAM adapts SAM2 for cross-view object correspondence using two complementary prompt generators and a multi-expert selection mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing segmentation models like SAM2 struggle with cross-view object correspondence due to drastic viewpoint and appearance variations between different perspectives (e.g., ego-centric and exo-centric views).

Method: Proposes V^2-SAM with: 1) Cross-View Anchor Prompt Generator (V^2-Anchor) for geometry-aware correspondences using DINOv3 features, 2) Cross-View Visual Prompt Generator (V^2-Visual) for appearance-guided cues via feature and structural alignment, and 3) Post-hoc Cyclic Consistency Selector (PCCS) to adaptively select the most reliable expert.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on Ego-Exo4D (ego-exo object correspondence), DAVIS-2017 (video object tracking), and HANDAL-X (robotic-ready cross-view correspondence).

Conclusion: V^2-SAM successfully adapts SAM2 for cross-view object correspondence through complementary prompt generators and adaptive expert selection, demonstrating strong performance across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Cross-view object correspondence, exemplified by the representative task of ego-exo object correspondence, aims to establish consistent associations of the same object across different viewpoints (e.g., ego-centric and exo-centric). This task poses significant challenges due to drastic viewpoint and appearance variations, making existing segmentation models, such as SAM2, non-trivial to apply directly. To address this, we present V^2-SAM, a unified cross-view object correspondence framework that adapts SAM2 from single-view segmentation to cross-view correspondence through two complementary prompt generators. Specifically, the Cross-View Anchor Prompt Generator (V^2-Anchor), built upon DINOv3 features, establishes geometry-aware correspondences and, for the first time, unlocks coordinate-based prompting for SAM2 in cross-view scenarios, while the Cross-View Visual Prompt Generator (V^2-Visual) enhances appearance-guided cues via a novel visual prompt matcher that aligns ego-exo representations from both feature and structural perspectives. To effectively exploit the strengths of both prompts, we further adopt a multi-expert design and introduce a Post-hoc Cyclic Consistency Selector (PCCS) that adaptively selects the most reliable expert based on cyclic consistency. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of V^2-SAM, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on Ego-Exo4D (ego-exo object correspondence), DAVIS-2017 (video object tracking), and HANDAL-X (robotic-ready cross-view correspondence).

*Taehoon Kim,Henry Gouk,Timothy Hospedales*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Null-TTA aligns diffusion models by optimizing the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance, preventing reward hacking while achieving state-of-the-art test-time alignment and maintaining cross-reward generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time alignment methods tend to either under-optimize or over-optimize (reward hack) the target reward function, exploiting non-semantic noise patterns rather than achieving meaningful semantic alignment.

Method: Optimize the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance rather than manipulating latent or noise variables, leveraging the structured semantic nature of the text embedding space to ensure alignment occurs on a semantically coherent manifold.

Result: Null-TTA achieves state-of-the-art target test-time alignment while maintaining strong cross-reward generalization, preventing reward hacking by avoiding exploitation of non-semantic noise patterns.

Conclusion: Semantic-space optimization through unconditional embedding optimization establishes an effective and principled novel paradigm for test-time alignment in diffusion models.

Abstract: Test-time alignment (TTA) aims to adapt models to specific rewards during inference. However, existing methods tend to either under-optimise or over-optimise (reward hack) the target reward function. We propose Null-Text Test-Time Alignment (Null-TTA), which aligns diffusion models by optimising the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance, rather than manipulating latent or noise variables. Due to the structured semantic nature of the text embedding space, this ensures alignment occurs on a semantically coherent manifold and prevents reward hacking (exploiting non-semantic noise patterns to improve the reward). Since the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance serves as the anchor for the model's generative distribution, Null-TTA directly steers model's generative distribution towards the target reward rather than just adjusting the samples, even without updating model parameters. Thanks to these desirable properties, we show that Null-TTA achieves state-of-the-art target test-time alignment while maintaining strong cross-reward generalisation. This establishes semantic-space optimisation as an effective and principled novel paradigm for TTA.

TL;DR: GaINeR is a geometry-aware implicit neural representation for 2D images that combines trainable Gaussian distributions with neural networks to enable continuous representation, interpretable structure, and local editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional INRs lack explicit geometric structure and have limited capabilities for local editing or integration with physical simulation, restricting their use in dynamic or interactive settings.

Method: Proposes GaINeR framework that retrieves K nearest Gaussians for image coordinates, aggregates distance-weighted embeddings, and predicts RGB values via neural network.

Result: Enables continuous image representation with interpretable geometric structure and flexible local editing capabilities.

Conclusion: GaINeR provides a foundation for physically aware and interactive image manipulation by combining Gaussian distributions with neural network-based INR.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have become an essential tool for modeling continuous 2D images, enabling high-fidelity reconstruction, super-resolution, and compression. Popular architectures such as SIREN, WIRE, and FINER demonstrate the potential of INR for capturing fine-grained image details. However, traditional INRs often lack explicit geometric structure and have limited capabilities for local editing or integration with physical simulation, restricting their applicability in dynamic or interactive settings. To address these limitations, we propose GaINeR: Geometry-Aware Implicit Network Representation, a novel framework for 2D images that combines trainable Gaussian distributions with a neural network-based INR. For a given image coordinate, the model retrieves the K nearest Gaussians, aggregates distance-weighted embeddings, and predicts the RGB value via a neural network. This design enables continuous image representation, interpretable geometric structure, and flexible local editing, providing a foundation for physically aware and interactive image manipulation. The official implementation of our method is publicly available at https://github.com/WJakubowska/GaINeR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning model successfully restores standard-dose MRI quality from low-dose (10-30%) contrast-enhanced images for cerebellopontine angle cistern, enabling accurate vestibular schwannoma detection and segmentation with significantly reduced contrast agent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce contrast agent dose in MRI scans while maintaining diagnostic image quality, particularly for cerebellopontine angle cistern imaging in vestibular schwannoma patients.

Method: Multi-center retrospective study using T1 and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI to simulate low-dose images, training deep learning models to restore standard-dose quality from reduced contrast agent doses.

Result: DL restoration improved image quality metrics (SSIM from 0.639 to 0.993, PSNR from 21.6 to 41.4 dB) and segmentation performance (Dice from 0.673 to 0.734) at 10% input dose. Radiologist evaluation confirmed excellent image quality at 10-30% dose levels.

Conclusion: Deep learning enables reliable cerebellopontine angle cistern MRI with only 10-30% of standard contrast agent dose while maintaining diagnostic quality for lesion detection and characterization.

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate a deep learning (DL) model for reducing the agent dose of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI (T1ce) of the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) cistern. Materials and methods: In this multi-center retrospective study, T1 and T1ce of vestibular schwannoma (VS) patients were used to simulate low-dose T1ce with varying reductions of contrast agent dose. DL models were trained to restore standard-dose T1ce from the low-dose simulation. The image quality and segmentation performance of the DL-restored T1ce were evaluated. A head and neck radiologist was asked to rate DL-restored images in multiple aspects, including image quality and diagnostic characterization. Results: 203 MRI studies from 72 VS patients (mean age, 58.51 \pm 14.73, 39 men) were evaluated. As the input dose increased, the structural similarity index measure of the restored T1ce increased from 0.639 \pm 0.113 to 0.993 \pm 0.009, and the peak signal-to-noise ratio increased from 21.6 \pm 3.73 dB to 41.4 \pm 4.84 dB. At 10% input dose, using DL-restored T1ce for segmentation improved the Dice from 0.673 to 0.734, the 95% Hausdorff distance from 2.38 mm to 2.07 mm, and the average surface distance from 1.00 mm to 0.59 mm. Both DL-restored T1ce from 10% and 30% input doses showed excellent images, with the latter being considered more informative. Conclusion: The DL model improved the image quality of low-dose MRI of the CPA cistern, which makes lesion detection and diagnostic characterization possible with 10% - 30% of the standard dose.

TL;DR: A smooth regularization technique using Gaussian Random Walk to enforce temporal coherence in video recognition models, significantly improving accuracy of lightweight architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To instill strong temporal inductive bias in video recognition models, particularly benefiting lightweight architectures by better capturing natural temporal coherence in videos.

Method: Encourages smoothness in intermediate-layer embeddings of consecutive frames by modeling their changes as a Gaussian Random Walk, penalizing abrupt representational shifts and promoting low-acceleration solutions.

Result: Achieves 3.8% to 6.4% accuracy improvement on Kinetics-600, with MoViNets improving state-of-the-art by 3.8%-6.1% within FLOP constraints, and MobileNetV3/MoViNets-Stream gaining 4.9%-6.4% over prior models with comparable memory footprints.

Conclusion: The proposed smooth regularization technique effectively enhances temporal modeling in lightweight video recognition models, leading to significant accuracy improvements while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: We propose a smooth regularization technique that instills a strong temporal inductive bias in video recognition models, particularly benefiting lightweight architectures. Our method encourages smoothness in the intermediate-layer embeddings of consecutive frames by modeling their changes as a Gaussian Random Walk (GRW). This penalizes abrupt representational shifts, thereby promoting low-acceleration solutions that better align with the natural temporal coherence inherent in videos. By leveraging this enforced smoothness, lightweight models can more effectively capture complex temporal dynamics. Applied to such models, our technique yields a 3.8% to 6.4% accuracy improvement on Kinetics-600. Notably, the MoViNets model family trained with our smooth regularization improves the current state of the art by 3.8% to 6.1% within their respective FLOP constraints, while MobileNetV3 and the MoViNets-Stream family achieve gains of 4.9% to 6.4% over prior state-of-the-art models with comparable memory footprints.

*Biagio La Rosa,Leilani H. Gilpin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for open vocabulary compositional explanations in vision that uses semantic segmentation masks instead of human annotations to probe neurons for arbitrary concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing compositional explanations rely on human-annotated datasets, limiting their applicability to specific domains and predefined concepts.

Method: Three-step framework: specify arbitrary concepts, generate semantic segmentation masks using open vocabulary models, and derive compositional explanations from these masks.

Result: The framework enables flexible neuron probing for arbitrary concepts and datasets, with comparisons showing differences from human-annotated approaches and enhanced interpretability.

Conclusion: Open vocabulary compositional explanations provide greater flexibility and applicability across domains while maintaining interpretability.

Abstract: Neurons are the fundamental building blocks of deep neural networks, and their interconnections allow AI to achieve unprecedented results. Motivated by the goal of understanding how neurons encode information, compositional explanations leverage logical relationships between concepts to express the spatial alignment between neuron activations and human knowledge. However, these explanations rely on human-annotated datasets, restricting their applicability to specific domains and predefined concepts. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing a framework for the vision domain that allows users to probe neurons for arbitrary concepts and datasets. Specifically, the framework leverages masks generated by open vocabulary semantic segmentation to compute open vocabulary compositional explanations. The proposed framework consists of three steps: specifying arbitrary concepts, generating semantic segmentation masks using open vocabulary models, and deriving compositional explanations from these masks. The paper compares the proposed framework with previous methods for computing compositional explanations both in terms of quantitative metrics and human interpretability, analyzes the differences in explanations when shifting from human-annotated data to model-annotated data, and showcases the additional capabilities provided by the framework in terms of flexibility of the explanations with respect to the tasks and properties of interest.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UruDendro4, a new dataset of 102 Pinus taeda L. wood cross-section images with manual ring annotations, and provides baseline performance for automatic ring detection using state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual measurement of tree-ring growth is time-consuming and imprecise, and there is scarcity of wood cross-section data for developing automated algorithms.

Method: Created UruDendro4 dataset with samples from multiple stem heights, performed baseline evaluation using DeepCS-TRD method, conducted ablation experiments, and demonstrated improved generalization through dataset inclusion.

Result: DeepCS-TRD achieved best performance with 0.838 mAP, 0.782 mAR, and 0.084 ARE. Training with this dataset improved model generalization for tree-ring detection.

Conclusion: UruDendro4 enables volumetric modeling of annual growth and supports development of automated ring detection methods, with DeepCS-TRD showing state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Tree-ring growth represents the annual wood increment for a tree, and quantifying it allows researchers to assess which silvicultural practices are best suited for each species. Manual measurement of this growth is time-consuming and often imprecise, as it is typically performed along 4 to 8 radial directions on a cross-sectional disc. In recent years, automated algorithms and datasets have emerged to enhance accuracy and automate the delineation of annual rings in cross-sectional images.
  To address the scarcity of wood cross-section data, we introduce the UruDendro4 dataset, a collection of 102 image samples of Pinus taeda L., each manually annotated with annual growth rings. Unlike existing public datasets, UruDendro4 includes samples extracted at multiple heights along the stem, allowing for the volumetric modeling of annual growth using manually delineated rings. This dataset (images and annotations) allows the development of volumetric models for annual wood estimation based on cross-sectional imagery.
  Additionally, we provide a performance baseline for automatic ring detection on this dataset using state-of-the-art methods. The highest performance was achieved by the DeepCS-TRD method, with a mean Average Precision of 0.838, a mean Average Recall of 0.782, and an Adapted Rand Error score of 0.084. A series of ablation experiments were conducted to empirically validate the final parameter configuration. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that training a learning model including this dataset improves the model's generalization in the tree-ring detection task.

TL;DR: BUSTR is a multitask vision-language framework that generates breast ultrasound reports without paired image-report data by using structured descriptors and radiomics features, achieving improved clinical efficacy and report quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated radiology report generation for breast ultrasound is limited by lack of paired image-report datasets and hallucination risks from large language models.

Method: BUSTR constructs reports from structured descriptors (BI-RADS, pathology, histology) and radiomics features, uses a multi-head Swin encoder with multitask loss for descriptor-aware visual representations, and aligns visual/textual tokens via dual-level objective combining cross-entropy and cosine-similarity alignment.

Result: BUSTR consistently improves standard natural language generation metrics and clinical efficacy metrics across two BUS datasets (BrEaST and BUS-BRA), particularly for key targets like BI-RADS category and pathology.

Conclusion: The descriptor-aware vision model trained with combined token-level and alignment loss improves both automatic report metrics and clinical efficacy without requiring paired image-report data.

Abstract: Automated radiology report generation (RRG) for breast ultrasound (BUS) is limited by the lack of paired image-report datasets and the risk of hallucinations from large language models. We propose BUSTR, a multitask vision-language framework that generates BUS reports without requiring paired image-report supervision. BUSTR constructs reports from structured descriptors (e.g., BI-RADS, pathology, histology) and radiomics features, learns descriptor-aware visual representations with a multi-head Swin encoder trained using a multitask loss over dataset-specific descriptor sets, and aligns visual and textual tokens via a dual-level objective that combines token-level cross-entropy with a cosine-similarity alignment loss between input and output representations. We evaluate BUSTR on two public BUS datasets, BrEaST and BUS-BRA, which differ in size and available descriptors. Across both datasets, BUSTR consistently improves standard natural language generation metrics and clinical efficacy metrics, particularly for key targets such as BI-RADS category and pathology. Our results show that this descriptor-aware vision model, trained with a combined token-level and alignment loss, improves both automatic report metrics and clinical efficacy without requiring paired image-report data.

### [29] [Beyond Realism: Learning the Art of Expressive Composition with StickerNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20957)
*Haoming Lu,David Kocharian,Humphrey Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StickerNet is a two-stage framework for expressive image composition that learns from real user editing data to predict placement parameters like opacity, mask, location, and scale, focusing on artistic and engaging content rather than realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image composition research focuses on visual realism, but real-world users on creative platforms often aim for artistic, playful, or socially engaging content that doesn't preserve realism, creating a gap between research and practical editing needs.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) determines composition type, 2) predicts placement parameters (opacity, mask, location, scale). Dataset built from 1.8 million real user editing actions from an online creative platform.

Result: StickerNet outperforms common baselines and closely matches human placement behavior in user studies and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating effectiveness in learning from real-world editing patterns.

Conclusion: This work introduces a new direction in visual understanding that emphasizes expressiveness and user intent over realism, showing the value of learning from authentic user editing behavior.

Abstract: As a widely used operation in image editing workflows, image composition has traditionally been studied with a focus on achieving visual realism and semantic plausibility. However, in practical editing scenarios of the modern content creation landscape, many compositions are not intended to preserve realism. Instead, users of online platforms motivated by gaining community recognition often aim to create content that is more artistic, playful, or socially engaging. Taking inspiration from this observation, we define the expressive composition task, a new formulation of image composition that embraces stylistic diversity and looser placement logic, reflecting how users edit images on real-world creative platforms. To address this underexplored problem, we present StickerNet, a two-stage framework that first determines the composition type, then predicts placement parameters such as opacity, mask, location, and scale accordingly. Unlike prior work that constructs datasets by simulating object placements on real images, we directly build our dataset from 1.8 million editing actions collected on an anonymous online visual creation and editing platform, each reflecting user-community validated placement decisions. This grounding in authentic editing behavior ensures strong alignment between task definition and training supervision. User studies and quantitative evaluations show that StickerNet outperforms common baselines and closely matches human placement behavior, demonstrating the effectiveness of learning from real-world editing patterns despite the inherent ambiguity of the task. This work introduces a new direction in visual understanding that emphasizes expressiveness and user intent over realism.

*Md Adnan Arefeen,Biplob Debnath,Srimat Chakradhar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TrafficLens is a novel algorithm that accelerates multi-camera traffic video analysis by using sequential VLM processing with overlapping camera coverage and object-level similarity detection, reducing conversion time by 4x while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches using LLMs with RAG systems require time-consuming video-to-text conversion via VLMs, causing delays in timely traffic analysis and incident investigation at multi-camera intersections.

Method: Uses sequential processing with overlapping camera coverage areas, iteratively applying VLMs with varying token limits using previous outputs as prompts, and incorporates object-level similarity detection to bypass redundant VLM invocations.

Result: Experimental results show TrafficLens reduces video-to-text conversion time by up to 4x while maintaining information accuracy compared to conventional approaches.

Conclusion: TrafficLens provides an efficient solution for real-time traffic video analysis at multi-camera intersections, enabling faster insights and incident investigation without compromising data accuracy.

Abstract: Traffic cameras are essential in urban areas, playing a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems. Multiple cameras at intersections enhance law enforcement capabilities, traffic management, and pedestrian safety. However, efficiently managing and analyzing multi-camera feeds poses challenges due to the vast amount of data. Analyzing such huge video data requires advanced analytical tools. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, equipped with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, excel in text-based tasks, integrating them into traffic video analysis demands converting video data into text using a Vision-Language Model (VLM), which is time-consuming and delays the timely utilization of traffic videos for generating insights and investigating incidents. To address these challenges, we propose TrafficLens, a tailored algorithm for multi-camera traffic intersections. TrafficLens employs a sequential approach, utilizing overlapping coverage areas of cameras. It iteratively applies VLMs with varying token limits, using previous outputs as prompts for subsequent cameras, enabling rapid generation of detailed textual descriptions while reducing processing time. Additionally, TrafficLens intelligently bypasses redundant VLM invocations through an object-level similarity detector. Experimental results with real-world datasets demonstrate that TrafficLens reduces video-to-text conversion time by up to $4\times$ while maintaining information accuracy.

*Al Amin,Kamrul Hasan,Liang Hong,Sharif Ullah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A privacy-preserving federated learning framework combining Vision Transformers with homomorphic encryption for secure multi-institutional histopathology classification, achieving 96.12% accuracy while preventing gradient-based reconstruction attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collaborative machine learning in healthcare is limited by privacy regulations like HIPAA that prohibit direct data sharing, and conventional federated learning remains vulnerable to gradient reconstruction attacks that can expose sensitive medical information.

Method: Combines Vision Transformers with homomorphic encryption, using ViT CLS tokens as compact 768-dimensional feature representations that are encrypted using CKKS homomorphic encryption before transmission to the server for secure aggregation.

Result: Encrypting CLS tokens achieves 30-fold communication reduction compared to gradient encryption, prevents model inversion attacks (vs vulnerable gradients with PSNR: 52.26 dB, SSIM: 0.999, NMI: 0.741), and enables encrypted inference with only 326 KB encrypted data per round. Achieves 96.12% global accuracy unencrypted and 90.02% encrypted.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides strong privacy guarantees for collaborative healthcare ML by preventing reconstruction attacks while maintaining high classification accuracy and significantly reducing communication overhead through CLS token encryption.

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning across healthcare institutions promises improved diagnostic accuracy by leveraging diverse datasets, yet privacy regulations such as HIPAA prohibit direct patient data sharing. While federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training without raw data exchange, recent studies show that model gradients in conventional FL remain vulnerable to reconstruction attacks, potentially exposing sensitive medical information. This paper presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework combining Vision Transformers (ViT) with homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure multi-institutional histopathology classification. The approach leverages the ViT CLS token as a compact 768-dimensional feature representation for secure aggregation, encrypting these tokens using CKKS homomorphic encryption before transmission to the server. We demonstrate that encrypting CLS tokens achieves a 30-fold communication reduction compared to gradient encryption while maintaining strong privacy guarantees. Through evaluation on a three-client federated setup for lung cancer histopathology classification, we show that gradients are highly susceptible to model inversion attacks (PSNR: 52.26 dB, SSIM: 0.999, NMI: 0.741), enabling near-perfect image reconstruction. In contrast, the proposed CLS-protected HE approach prevents such attacks while enabling encrypted inference directly on ciphertexts, requiring only 326 KB of encrypted data transmission per aggregation round. The framework achieves 96.12 percent global classification accuracy in the unencrypted domain and 90.02 percent in the encrypted domain.

*Yingying Deng,Xiangyu He,Fan Tang,Weiming Dong,Xucheng Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an inversion-free style transfer framework using dual rectified flows that eliminates the need for computationally expensive inversion processes, enabling style transfer with only forward passes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing diffusion-based style transfer methods that rely on computationally intensive inversion processes, which compromise efficiency and introduce visual distortions when inversion is inaccurate.

Method: Uses dual rectified flows to predict content and style trajectories in parallel, then fuses them through dynamic midpoint interpolation that integrates velocities from both paths while adapting to the evolving stylized image. Includes attention injection for style integration guidance.

Result: Achieves robust fusion without naive overlays, demonstrates generalization across diverse styles and content, and provides an effective and efficient pipeline for style transfer.

Conclusion: The proposed inversion-free framework based on dual rectified flows offers a computationally efficient solution for style transfer that avoids the shortcomings of inversion-based methods while maintaining visual fidelity and content preservation.

Abstract: Style transfer, a pivotal task in image processing, synthesizes visually compelling images by seamlessly blending realistic content with artistic styles, enabling applications in photo editing and creative design. While mainstream training-free diffusion-based methods have greatly advanced style transfer in recent years, their reliance on computationally inversion processes compromises efficiency and introduces visual distortions when inversion is inaccurate. To address these limitations, we propose a novel \textit{inversion-free} style transfer framework based on dual rectified flows, which tackles the challenge of finding an unknown stylized distribution from two distinct inputs (content and style images), \textit{only with forward pass}. Our approach predicts content and style trajectories in parallel, then fuses them through a dynamic midpoint interpolation that integrates velocities from both paths while adapting to the evolving stylized image. By jointly modeling the content, style, and stylized distributions, our velocity field design achieves robust fusion and avoids the shortcomings of naive overlays. Attention injection further guides style integration, enhancing visual fidelity, content preservation, and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate generalization across diverse styles and content, providing an effective and efficient pipeline for style transfer.

*Yu-Huan Wu,Zi-Xuan Zhu,Yan Wang,Liangli Zhen,Deng-Ping Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new Ref-COD framework that distills reference images into class-prototype memory during training, eliminating the need for test-time references through query-conditioned prototype mixture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Ref-COD systems require reference images at test time, which limits deployability, adds latency, and increases data-collection burden.

Method: Maintains EMA-updated prototypes per category, predicts mixture weights from queries to synthesize reference vectors, and uses bidirectional attention alignment to bridge representation gaps between references and queries.

Result: Achieves competitive or superior performance on R2C7K benchmark compared to state-of-the-art methods while eliminating test-time reference requirements.

Conclusion: Proposes an efficient Ref-COD approach that works without mandatory references at inference, improving deployability and reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Referring Camouflaged Object Detection (Ref-COD) segments specified camouflaged objects in a scene by leveraging a small set of referring images. Though effective, current systems adopt a dual-branch design that requires reference images at test time, which limits deployability and adds latency and data-collection burden. We introduce a Ref-COD framework that distills references into a class-prototype memory during training and synthesizes a reference vector at inference via a query-conditioned mixture of prototypes. Concretely, we maintain an EMA-updated prototype per category and predict mixture weights from the query to produce a guidance vector without any test-time references. To bridge the representation gap between reference statistics and camouflaged query features, we propose a bidirectional attention alignment module that adapts both the query features and the class representation. Thus, our approach yields a simple, efficient path to Ref-COD without mandatory references. We evaluate the proposed method on the large-scale R2C7K benchmark. Extensive experiments demonstrate competitive or superior performance of the proposed method compared with recent state-of-the-arts. Code is available at https://github.com/yuhuan-wu/RefOnce.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WavePCNet is a physics-driven neural network that uses complex amplitude modeling and momentum memory to accurately localize and segment obscured objects from faint light patterns beyond the field of view, outperforming existing methods in challenging low signal-to-noise conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to capture coherent light propagation physics and converge to non-physical solutions under low signal-to-noise conditions, compromising observation stability and reliability for obscured object detection.

Method: WavePCNet integrates Tri-Phase Wavefront Complex-Propagation Reprojection with complex amplitude transfer operators, momentum memory mechanism for perturbation suppression, and High-frequency Cross-layer Compensation Enhancement for multi-scale frequency-selective pathways.

Result: Extensive experiments on four physically collected datasets show WavePCNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: WavePCNet effectively addresses the challenges of obscured object detection through physics-driven wavefront propagation modeling, demonstrating superior performance and reliability in complex environmental conditions.

Abstract: Accurately localizing and segmenting obscured objects from faint light patterns beyond the field of view is highly challenging due to multiple scattering and medium-induced perturbations. Most existing methods, based on real-valued modeling or local convolutional operations, are inadequate for capturing the underlying physics of coherent light propagation. Moreover, under low signal-to-noise conditions, these methods often converge to non-physical solutions, severely compromising the stability and reliability of the observation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel physics-driven Wavefront Propagating Compensation Network (WavePCNet) to simulate wavefront propagation and enhance the perception of obscured objects. This WavePCNet integrates the Tri-Phase Wavefront Complex-Propagation Reprojection (TriWCP) to incorporate complex amplitude transfer operators to precisely constrain coherent propagation behavior, along with a momentum memory mechanism to effectively suppress the accumulation of perturbations. Additionally, a High-frequency Cross-layer Compensation Enhancement is introduced to construct frequency-selective pathways with multi-scale receptive fields and dynamically model structural consistency across layers, further boosting the model's robustness and interpretability under complex environmental conditions. Extensive experiments conducted on four physically collected datasets demonstrate that WavePCNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across both accuracy and robustness.

TL;DR: GuardTrace-VL is a vision-aware safety auditor that monitors multimodal reasoning models' intermediate rationales to detect unsafe content during reasoning, achieving 93.1% F1 score on unsafe reasoning detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal safety guards only evaluate input questions and final answers, missing unsafe content that emerges during intermediate reasoning stages, creating deployment risks.

Method: Introduces GuardTrace-VL with joint image-text analysis of the full Question-Thinking-Answer pipeline, uses GuardTrace dataset generated via diverse prompting and human verification, and employs three-stage progressive training with data refinement.

Result: Achieves 93.1% F1 score on unsafe reasoning detection, representing 13.5% improvement over previous multimodal safety defense methods on both in-domain and out-of-domain test scenarios.

Conclusion: GuardTrace-VL effectively detects unsafe content in multimodal reasoning traces, addressing a critical gap in current safety evaluation methods for MLRMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) are increasingly deployed for vision-language tasks that produce explicit intermediate rationales. However, reasoning traces can contain unsafe content even when the final answer is non-harmful, creating deployment risks. Existing multimodal safety guards primarily evaluate only the input question and the final answer, neglecting the intermediate reasoning process. This oversight allows undetected harm, such as biased inferences or policy-violating use of visual context, to emerge during reasoning. We introduce GuardTrace-VL, a vision-aware safety auditor that monitors the full Question-Thinking-Answer (QTA) pipeline via joint image-text analysis, enabling detection of unsafe content as it emerges in the reasoning stage. To support training and evaluation, we construct the GuardTrace dataset, which is generated through diverse prompting strategies and refined via a MLRM- and human-based voting and verification pipeline. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage progressive training scheme combined with the data refinement process, enabling the model to learn nuanced and context-dependent safety preferences according to different risk levels. On our proposed test set covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, GuardTrace-VL model achieves an F1 score of 93.1% on unsafe reasoning detection tasks, representing a 13.5% improvement in F1 score compared to the previous strongest multimodal safety defense methods. The codes will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Layered image representation enables flexible editing but single image decomposition remains challenging due to limited methods and data. Strong connection observed between layer decomposition and in/outpainting tasks.

Method: Adapt diffusion-based inpainting model for layer decomposition using lightweight finetuning. Introduce multi-modal context fusion module with linear attention complexity to preserve detail in latent space. Trained on synthetic dataset from open-source assets.

Result: Achieves superior performance in object removal and occlusion recovery. Unlocks new possibilities in downstream editing and creative applications.

Conclusion: Proposed approach successfully bridges layer decomposition with inpainting tasks, enabling effective layered image editing through lightweight adaptation of existing models.

Abstract: Images can be viewed as layered compositions, foreground objects over background, with potential occlusions. This layered representation enables independent editing of elements, offering greater flexibility for content creation. Despite the progress in large generative models, decomposing a single image into layers remains challenging due to limited methods and data. We observe a strong connection between layer decomposition and in/outpainting tasks, and propose adapting a diffusion-based inpainting model for layer decomposition using lightweight finetuning. To further preserve detail in the latent space, we introduce a novel multi-modal context fusion module with linear attention complexity. Our model is trained purely on a synthetic dataset constructed from open-source assets and achieves superior performance in object removal and occlusion recovery, unlocking new possibilities in downstream editing and creative applications.

Motivation: Existing news image captioning methods struggle with incomplete information coverage, weak cross-modal alignment, and suboptimal visual-entity grounding, limiting their journalistic informativeness.

Method: MERGE constructs an entity-centric multimodal knowledge base (EMKB) integrating textual, visual, and structured knowledge. It uses multistage hypothesis-caption strategy for cross-modal alignment and dynamic retrieval guided by image content for visual-entity matching.

Result: Significant improvements on GoodNews and NYTimes800k datasets: +6.84 and +1.16 CIDEr gains in caption quality, +4.14 and +2.64 F1-score improvements in named entity recognition. Strong generalization on Visual News dataset with +20.17 CIDEr and +6.22 F1-score.

Conclusion: MERGE demonstrates superior performance, strong robustness, and domain adaptability in news image captioning by effectively addressing key challenges through multimodal entity-aware retrieval-augmented generation.

Abstract: News image captioning aims to produce journalistically informative descriptions by combining visual content with contextual cues from associated articles. Despite recent advances, existing methods struggle with three key challenges: (1) incomplete information coverage, (2) weak cross-modal alignment, and (3) suboptimal visual-entity grounding. To address these issues, we introduce MERGE, the first Multimodal Entity-aware Retrieval-augmented GEneration framework for news image captioning. MERGE constructs an entity-centric multimodal knowledge base (EMKB) that integrates textual, visual, and structured knowledge, enabling enriched background retrieval. It improves cross-modal alignment through a multistage hypothesis-caption strategy and enhances visual-entity matching via dynamic retrieval guided by image content. Extensive experiments on GoodNews and NYTimes800k show that MERGE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with CIDEr gains of +6.84 and +1.16 in caption quality, and F1-score improvements of +4.14 and +2.64 in named entity recognition. Notably, MERGE also generalizes well to the unseen Visual News dataset, achieving +20.17 in CIDEr and +6.22 in F1-score, demonstrating strong robustness and domain adaptability.

TL;DR: MetaRank is a meta-learning framework that automatically selects the most appropriate Model Transferability Estimation (MTE) metric for a given target dataset using textual descriptions and learned ranking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MTE metric selection is ad hoc or based on average performance, but no single metric works optimally across all datasets. The effectiveness of MTE metrics is highly task-dependent.

Method: Formulates metric selection as a learning-to-rank problem. Uses pretrained language models to encode dataset and metric descriptions into a shared semantic space. Trains a meta-predictor offline on diverse meta-tasks with listwise ranking objective.

Result: Extensive experiments across 11 pretrained models and 11 target datasets demonstrate strong effectiveness. MetaRank enables practitioners to select the most appropriate MTE metric a priori for new datasets.

Conclusion: MetaRank provides an effective solution for task-aware MTE metric selection, outperforming ad hoc approaches by leveraging semantic understanding of datasets and metrics through meta-learning.

Abstract: Selecting an appropriate pre-trained source model is a critical, yet computationally expensive, task in transfer learning. Model Transferability Estimation (MTE) methods address this by providing efficient proxy metrics to rank models without full fine-tuning. In practice, the choice of which MTE metric to use is often ad hoc or guided simply by a metric's average historical performance. However, we observe that the effectiveness of MTE metrics is highly task-dependent and no single metric is universally optimal across all target datasets. To address this gap, we introduce MetaRank, a meta-learning framework for automatic, task-aware MTE metric selection. We formulate metric selection as a learning-to-rank problem. Rather than relying on conventional meta-features, MetaRank encodes textual descriptions of both datasets and MTE metrics using a pretrained language model, embedding them into a shared semantic space. A meta-predictor is then trained offline on diverse meta-tasks to learn the intricate relationship between dataset characteristics and metric mechanisms, optimized with a listwise objective that prioritizes correctly ranking the top-performing metrics. During the subsequent online phase, MetaRank efficiently ranks the candidate MTE metrics for a new, unseen target dataset based on its textual description, enabling practitioners to select the most appropriate metric a priori. Extensive experiments across 11 pretrained models and 11 target datasets demonstrate the strong effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel trustworthy multi-view classification framework using prototypes to represent neighbor structures, enabling efficient cross-view consensus discovery and improved trustworthiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TMVC methods have high computational costs from dense neighbor relationships, cannot ensure inter-view consistency, and lack guarantees for learned neighbor structures being consistent in class space.

Method: Introduces prototypes to represent neighbor structures of each view, simplifies intra-view neighbor relations learning, and enables dynamic alignment of intra- and inter-view structures.

Result: Achieves competitive downstream performance and robustness compared to prevalent TMVC methods on multiple public multi-view datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework facilitates more efficient and consistent discovery of cross-view consensus, improving trustworthiness of multi-view classification outcomes.

Abstract: Trustworthy multi-view classification (TMVC) addresses the challenge of achieving reliable decision-making in complex scenarios where multi-source information is heterogeneous, inconsistent, or even conflicting. Existing TMVC approaches predominantly rely on globally dense neighbor relationships to model intra-view dependencies, leading to high computational costs and an inability to directly ensure consistency across inter-view relationships. Furthermore, these methods typically aggregate evidence from different views through manually assigned weights, lacking guarantees that the learned multi-view neighbor structures are consistent within the class space, thus undermining the trustworthiness of classification outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel TMVC framework that introduces prototypes to represent the neighbor structures of each view. By simplifying the learning of intra-view neighbor relations and enabling dynamic alignment of intra- and inter-view structure, our approach facilitates more efficient and consistent discovery of cross-view consensus. Extensive experiments on multiple public multi-view datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive downstream performance and robustness compared to prevalent TMVC methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CameraMaster is a unified camera-aware framework for image retouching that decouples camera directives and parameter embeddings to achieve precise physical control over camera parameters like exposure, white balance, and zoom.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-guided diffusion models struggle with physically consistent image retouching using precise parameter control. Current methods either rely on ambiguous text prompts that hinder precise camera control, or use separate training heads that compromise scalability and multi-parameter composition.

Method: CameraMaster explicitly decouples camera directive and parameter embeddings, using camera parameter embedding to modulate both directive and content semantics. It injects modulated directive into content features via cross-attention and uses directive/camera embeddings as conditioning signals throughout the denoising process for semantic-parameter alignment.

Result: CameraMaster produces monotonic and near-linear responses to parameter variations, supports seamless multi-parameter composition, and significantly outperforms existing methods. The framework was trained on a large-scale dataset of 78K image-prompt pairs with camera parameter annotations.

Conclusion: CameraMaster provides a unified solution for precise camera parameter control in image retouching, overcoming limitations of existing text-guided diffusion models by effectively decoupling and integrating camera directives with parameter embeddings.

Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models have greatly advanced image editing and generation. However, achieving physically consistent image retouching with precise parameter control (e.g., exposure, white balance, zoom) remains challenging. Existing methods either rely solely on ambiguous and entangled text prompts, which hinders precise camera control, or train separate heads/weights for parameter adjustment, which compromises scalability, multi-parameter composition, and sensitivity to subtle variations. To address these limitations, we propose CameraMaster, a unified camera-aware framework for image retouching. The key idea is to explicitly decouple the camera directive and then coherently integrate two critical information streams: a directive representation that captures the photographer's intent, and a parameter embedding that encodes precise camera settings. CameraMaster first uses the camera parameter embedding to modulate both the camera directive and the content semantics. The modulated directive is then injected into the content features via cross-attention, yielding a strongly camera-sensitive semantic context. In addition, the directive and camera embeddings are injected as conditioning and gating signals into the time embedding, enabling unified, layer-wise modulation throughout the denoising process and enforcing tight semantic-parameter alignment. To train and evaluate CameraMaster, we construct a large-scale dataset of 78K image-prompt pairs annotated with camera parameters. Extensive experiments show that CameraMaster produces monotonic and near-linear responses to parameter variations, supports seamless multi-parameter composition, and significantly outperforms existing methods.

TL;DR: CaptionQA is a utility-based benchmark that evaluates image captions by measuring how well they support downstream tasks across 4 domains, revealing significant gaps between image and caption utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation practices miss whether captions can effectively substitute for images in real downstream tasks, necessitating a utility-focused benchmark.

Method: Built 33,027 densely annotated multiple-choice questions across 4 domains with fine-grained taxonomies; uses LLMs to answer questions using captions alone to measure caption utility.

Result: Evaluation shows substantial gaps between image and caption utility, with models performing up to 32% lower on caption utility despite similar performance on traditional image-QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: CaptionQA provides a comprehensive utility-based evaluation framework that reveals limitations in current caption generation models and enables extension to new domains.

Abstract: Image captions serve as efficient surrogates for visual content in multimodal systems such as retrieval, recommendation, and multi-step agentic inference pipelines. Yet current evaluation practices miss a fundamental question: Can captions stand-in for images in real downstream tasks? We propose a utility-based benchmark, CaptionQA, to evaluate model-generated captions, where caption quality is measured by how well it supports downstream tasks. CaptionQA is an extensible domain-dependent benchmark covering 4 domains--Natural, Document, E-commerce, and Embodied AI--each with fine-grained taxonomies (25 top-level and 69 subcategories) that identify useful information for domain-specific tasks. CaptionQA builds 33,027 densely annotated multiple-choice questions (50.3 per image on average) that explicitly require visual information to answer, providing a comprehensive probe of caption utility. In our evaluation protocol, an LLM answers these questions using captions alone, directly measuring whether captions preserve image-level utility and are utilizable by a downstream LLM. Evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals substantial gaps between the image and its caption utility. Notably, models nearly identical on traditional image-QA benchmarks lower by up to 32% in caption utility. We release CaptionQA along with an open-source pipeline for extension to new domains.

Motivation: Existing music-to-dance generation methods have limited generation efficiency, which restricts their ability to support high-fidelity 3D rendering and expressiveness in real-world applications like virtual reality and digital entertainment.

Method: Combines MeanFlow with Physical Consistency Constraints for high-quality motion generation with few sampling steps. Uses BiMamba-based backbone with Channel-Level Cross-Modal Fusion for efficient non-autoregressive generation. Also supports interactive motion editing.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on AIST++ and FineDance datasets in both motion quality and generation efficiency (inference speed and memory utilization).

Conclusion: FlowerDance provides an efficient solution for music-to-dance generation that enables high-quality motion with physical plausibility and artistic expressiveness while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: Music-to-dance generation aims to translate auditory signals into expressive human motion, with broad applications in virtual reality, choreography, and digital entertainment. Despite promising progress, the limited generation efficiency of existing methods leaves insufficient computational headroom for high-fidelity 3D rendering, thereby constraining the expressiveness of 3D characters during real-world applications. Thus, we propose FlowerDance, which not only generates refined motion with physical plausibility and artistic expressiveness, but also achieves significant generation efficiency on inference speed and memory utilization . Specifically, FlowerDance combines MeanFlow with Physical Consistency Constraints, which enables high-quality motion generation with only a few sampling steps. Moreover, FlowerDance leverages a simple but efficient model architecture with BiMamba-based backbone and Channel-Level Cross-Modal Fusion, which generates dance with efficient non-autoregressive manner. Meanwhile, FlowerDance supports motion editing, enabling users to interactively refine dance sequences. Extensive experiments on AIST++ and FineDance show that FlowerDance achieves state-of-the-art results in both motion quality and generation efficiency. Code will be released upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal LLMs struggle with accurate nodule morphology description and medical expertise integration, limiting clinical reliability. Multi-agent systems offer potential for balancing generality and precision in medical applications.

Method: Three-module system: Nodule Spotter coordinates detection models; Radiologist uses localized image description for CT reports; Doctor Agent System performs malignancy reasoning using images, reports, pathology knowledge base, and multi-agent framework.

Result: Outperforms mainstream vision-language models, agent systems, and expert models on private datasets and LIDC-IDRI dataset, demonstrating superior nodule diagnosis capabilities.

Conclusion: LungNoduleAgent shows the importance of region-level semantic alignment and multi-agent collaboration in nodule diagnosis, serving as a promising foundational tool for clinical lung nodule analysis.

Abstract: Diagnosing lung cancer typically involves physicians identifying lung nodules in Computed tomography (CT) scans and generating diagnostic reports based on their morphological features and medical expertise. Although advancements have been made in using multimodal large language models for analyzing lung CT scans, challenges remain in accurately describing nodule morphology and incorporating medical expertise. These limitations affect the reliability and effectiveness of these models in clinical settings. Collaborative multi-agent systems offer a promising strategy for achieving a balance between generality and precision in medical applications, yet their potential in pathology has not been thoroughly explored. To bridge these gaps, we introduce LungNoduleAgent, an innovative collaborative multi-agent system specifically designed for analyzing lung CT scans. LungNoduleAgent streamlines the diagnostic process into sequential components, improving precision in describing nodules and grading malignancy through three primary modules. The first module, the Nodule Spotter, coordinates clinical detection models to accurately identify nodules. The second module, the Radiologist, integrates localized image description techniques to produce comprehensive CT reports. Finally, the Doctor Agent System performs malignancy reasoning by using images and CT reports, supported by a pathology knowledge base and a multi-agent system framework. Extensive testing on two private datasets and the public LIDC-IDRI dataset indicates that LungNoduleAgent surpasses mainstream vision-language models, agent systems, and advanced expert models. These results highlight the importance of region-level semantic alignment and multi-agent collaboration in diagnosing nodules. LungNoduleAgent stands out as a promising foundational tool for supporting clinical analyses of lung nodules.

*Hakki Motorcu,Mujdat Cetin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework that combines generative models with explicit physical constraints for spatially varying image deblurring, outperforming both model-based and generative approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either produce over-smoothed results with artifacts (model-based deep unrolling) or hallucinate details due to weak physical constraints (generative models). There's a need to bridge the gap between physical accuracy and perceptual realism.

Method: Models degradation as a dense continuum of high-dimensional compressed kernels to capture minute variations, then conditions a ControlNet architecture to strongly guide the diffusion sampling process with explicit physical constraints.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art model-based methods and generative baselines in challenging, severely blurred scenarios, effectively bridging physical accuracy and perceptual realism.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully reconciles model-based and generative paradigms by taming powerful generative priors with explicit, dense physical constraints for superior spatially varying image deblurring.

Abstract: Spatially varying image deblurring remains a fundamentally ill-posed problem, especially when degradations arise from complex mixtures of motion and other forms of blur under significant noise. State-of-the-art learning-based approaches generally fall into two paradigms: model-based deep unrolling methods that enforce physical constraints by modeling the degradations, but often produce over-smoothed, artifact-laden textures, and generative models that achieve superior perceptual quality yet hallucinate details due to weak physical constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that uniquely reconciles these paradigms by taming a powerful generative prior with explicit, dense physical constraints. Rather than oversimplifying the degradation field, we model it as a dense continuum of high-dimensional compressed kernels, ensuring that minute variations in motion and other degradation patterns are captured. We leverage this rich descriptor field to condition a ControlNet architecture, strongly guiding the diffusion sampling process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively bridges the gap between physical accuracy and perceptual realism, outperforming state-of-the-art model-based methods as well as generative baselines in challenging, severely blurred scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MUSE is a unified framework for emotional image generation and editing that uses test-time scaling with an off-the-shelf emotion classifier, addressing how, when, and which emotions to guide synthesis without requiring specialized datasets or model updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches artificially separate generation and editing tasks, creating inefficiencies and limiting applications where these tasks naturally intertwine, such as therapeutic interventions or storytelling.

Method: Uses test-time scaling strategy with gradient-based optimization of emotional tokens, identifies optimal timing using semantic similarity, and employs multi-emotion loss to reduce interference from inherent and similar emotions.

Result: Performs favorably against all methods for both generation and editing, improving emotional accuracy and semantic diversity while maintaining optimal balance between content, text prompts, and realistic emotional expression.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for emotion synthesis by unifying generation and editing capabilities without requiring specialized datasets or model updates.

Abstract: Images evoke emotions that profoundly influence perception, often prioritized over content. Current Image Emotional Synthesis (IES) approaches artificially separate generation and editing tasks, creating inefficiencies and limiting applications where these tasks naturally intertwine, such as therapeutic interventions or storytelling. In this work, we introduce MUSE, the first unified framework capable of both emotional generation and editing. By adopting a strategy conceptually aligned with Test-Time Scaling (TTS) that widely used in both LLM and diffusion model communities, it avoids the requirement for additional updating diffusion model and specialized emotional synthesis datasets. More specifically, MUSE addresses three key questions in emotional synthesis: (1) HOW to stably guide synthesis by leveraging an off-the-shelf emotion classifier with gradient-based optimization of emotional tokens; (2) WHEN to introduce emotional guidance by identifying the optimal timing using semantic similarity as a supervisory signal; and (3) WHICH emotion to guide synthesis through a multi-emotion loss that reduces interference from inherent and similar emotions. Experimental results show that MUSE performs favorably against all methods for both generation and editing, improving emotional accuracy and semantic diversity while maintaining an optimal balance between desired content, adherence to text prompts, and realistic emotional expression. It establishes a new paradigm for emotion synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-term AD predictions face difficulties maintaining disease-related characteristics when dealing with irregular time intervals in sequential imaging data. Time-related distribution aspects can reflect disease characteristic changes in unevenly distributed images.

Method: T-NIG model uses brain images from two time points to create intermediate images, forecast future images, and predict disease. It identifies features using coordinate neighborhoods, incorporates time parameter into normal inverse gamma distribution, and uses uncertainty estimation to reduce epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties.

Result: T-NIG demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term prediction tasks. It proficiently forecasts disease progression while maintaining disease-related characteristics even with irregular temporal data distribution.

Conclusion: The proposed T-NIG model effectively handles irregular time intervals in brain imaging sequences for Alzheimer's Disease prediction through temporal parameter estimation and uncertainty reduction, achieving superior performance in maintaining disease characteristics over time.

Abstract: Image generation can provide physicians with an imaging diagnosis basis in the prediction of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Recent research has shown that long-term AD predictions by image generation often face difficulties maintaining disease-related characteristics when dealing with irregular time intervals in sequential data. Considering that the time-related aspects of the distribution can reflect changes in disease-related characteristics when images are distributed unevenly, this research proposes a model to estimate the temporal parameter within the Normal Inverse Gamma Distribution (T-NIG) to assist in generating images over the long term. The T-NIG model employs brain images from two different time points to create intermediate brain images, forecast future images, and predict the disease. T-NIG is designed by identifying features using coordinate neighborhoods. It incorporates a time parameter into the normal inverse gamma distribution to understand how features change in brain imaging sequences that have varying time intervals. Additionally, T-NIG utilizes uncertainty estimation to reduce both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in the model, which arise from insufficient temporal data. In particular, the T-NIG model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term prediction tasks within the dataset. Experimental results indicate that T-NIG is proficient in forecasting disease progression while maintaining disease-related characteristics, even when faced with an irregular temporal data distribution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based editing models struggle with complex user instructions involving compositional relationships, contextual cues, or referring expressions, leading to semantic drift and inaccurate edits.

Method: Proposes MIRA, a plug-and-play multimodal reasoning agent that performs editing through iterative perception-reasoning-action loops, predicting atomic edit instructions step by step using visual feedback. Trained on 150K multimodal dataset with SFT + GRPO pipeline.

Result: When paired with open-source editing models (Flux.1-Kontext, Step1X-Edit, Qwen-Image-Edit), MIRA significantly improves semantic consistency and perceptual quality, achieving performance comparable to or exceeding proprietary systems like GPT-Image and Nano-Banana.

Conclusion: MIRA effectively addresses the limitations of current diffusion-based editing models by simulating multi-turn human-model interactions, enabling more accurate interpretation and execution of complex editing instructions.

Abstract: Instruction-guided image editing offers an intuitive way for users to edit images with natural language. However, diffusion-based editing models often struggle to accurately interpret complex user instructions, especially those involving compositional relationships, contextual cues, or referring expressions, leading to edits that drift semantically or fail to reflect the intended changes. We tackle this problem by proposing MIRA (Multimodal Iterative Reasoning Agent), a lightweight, plug-and-play multimodal reasoning agent that performs editing through an iterative perception-reasoning-action loop, effectively simulating multi-turn human-model interaction processes. Instead of issuing a single prompt or static plan, MIRA predicts atomic edit instructions step by step, using visual feedback to make its decisions. Our 150K multimodal tool-use dataset, MIRA-Editing, combined with a two-stage SFT + GRPO training pipeline, enables MIRA to perform reasoning and editing over complex editing instructions. When paired with open-source image editing models such as Flux.1-Kontext, Step1X-Edit, and Qwen-Image-Edit, MIRA significantly improves both semantic consistency and perceptual quality, achieving performance comparable to or exceeding proprietary systems such as GPT-Image and Nano-Banana.

TL;DR: Proposes a novel iris authentication pipeline using 3D-CNN to capture spatio-temporal features, trained with curriculum learning for robust performance against rotation, scale, reflections, and blur.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing iris authentication methods struggle with robustness to variations like rotation, scale, reflections, and blur, and rely on simple point-to-point comparisons without leveraging spatio-temporal structure of iris patterns.

Method: Splits iris images into sequences of sub-images, uses 3D-CNN to capture spatial and spatio-temporal features, trains with curriculum learning using triplet and ArcFace loss for discriminative embeddings.

Result: The approach learns rich spatio-temporal representations that embed temporal dependencies directly into feature space, improving discriminability in deep metric domain.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a robust and generalizable solution for iris authentication that effectively handles common challenges like rotation, scale, reflections, and blur.

Abstract: Iris authentication algorithms have achieved impressive recognition performance, making them highly promising for real-world applications such as border control, citizen identification, and both criminal investigations and commercial systems. However, their robustness is still challenged by variations in rotation, scale, specular reflections, and defocus blur. In addition, most existing approaches rely on straightforward point-to-point comparisons, typically using cosine or L2 distance, without effectively leveraging the spatio-spatial-temporal structure of iris patterns. To address these limitations, we propose a novel and generalized matching pipeline that learns rich spatio-spatial-temporal representations of iris features. Our approach first splits each iris image along one dimension, generating a sequence of sub-images that serve as input to a 3D-CNN, enabling the network to capture both spatial and spatio-spatial-temporal cues. To further enhance the modeling of spatio-spatial-temporal feature dynamics, we train the model in curriculum manner. This design allows the network to embed temporal dependencies directly into the feature space, improving discriminability in the deep metric domain. The framework is trained end-to-end with triplet and ArcFace loss in a curriculum manner, enforcing highly discriminative embeddings despite challenges like rotation, scale, reflections, and blur. This design yields a robust and generalizable solution for iris authentication.Github code: https://github.com/GeetanjaliGTZ/CLRecogEye

TL;DR: Pygmalion Effect in Vision framework transforms reflective objects into clay-like forms to separate appearance from geometry, enabling robust 3D reconstruction from multi-view images with complex reflections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reflection remains a challenge in 3D reconstruction due to the entanglement of appearance and geometry under view-dependent reflections, which complicates accurate geometry estimation.

Method: Dual-branch network with BRDF-based reflective branch and clay-guided branch that stabilizes geometry and refines surface normals, trained jointly using synthesized clay-like images as reflection-free supervision.

Result: Substantial improvement in normal accuracy and mesh completeness over existing reflection-handling methods on both synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: Seeing by unshining - translating radiance into neutrality - serves as a powerful inductive bias for reflective object geometry learning, enabling better separation of appearance and geometry.

Abstract: Understanding reflection remains a long-standing challenge in 3D reconstruction due to the entanglement of appearance and geometry under view-dependent reflections. In this work, we present the Pygmalion Effect in Vision, a novel framework that metaphorically "sculpts" reflective objects into clay-like forms through image-to-clay translation. Inspired by the myth of Pygmalion, our method learns to suppress specular cues while preserving intrinsic geometric consistency, enabling robust reconstruction from multi-view images containing complex reflections. Specifically, we introduce a dual-branch network in which a BRDF-based reflective branch is complemented by a clay-guided branch that stabilizes geometry and refines surface normals. The two branches are trained jointly using the synthesized clay-like images, which provide a neutral, reflection-free supervision signal that complements the reflective views. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate substantial improvement in normal accuracy and mesh completeness over existing reflection-handling methods. Beyond technical gains, our framework reveals that seeing by unshining, translating radiance into neutrality, can serve as a powerful inductive bias for reflective object geometry learning.

Motivation: Radar sensors provide reliable perception in adverse conditions, but existing radar approaches are fragmented and task-specific, preventing transfer learning across different tasks.

Result: Proposes localization-aware metrics for spatial accuracy assessment beyond traditional detection measures.

Conclusion: RadarFM enables unified scene understanding and transfer learning across radar perception tasks through structured spatial language supervision.

Abstract: Radar sensors provide reliable perception across adverse weather, lighting, and long-range conditions. Recent advances in foundation models have transformed visual and language understanding, yet their integration with radar sensing remains largely underexplored. Existing radar approaches are fragmented and task-specific; each downstream task employs distinct architectures and training objectives, preventing transfer across tasks. In this work, we introduce RadarFM: a radar foundation model that learns unified scene-level representations through structured spatial language supervision. We make two key contributions: (1) a structured caption framework that encodes vehicle distributions in native radar coordinates, and (2) a hash-aware contrastive learning objective that quantifies continuous scene similarity rather than binary matching, enabling fine-grained spatial reasoning. Leveraging the CARLA simulator, we generate large-scale, well-annotated radar datasets across diverse driving scenarios. We also propose localization-aware metrics that assess spatial accuracy beyond traditional detection measures.

TL;DR: EM-KD enhances Efficient MLLMs through knowledge distillation by addressing unbalanced vision tokens using Manhattan distance and Hungarian matching, then applying Vision-Language Affinity Distillation and Vision Semantic Distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing efficient MLLMs lose visual information when compressing vision tokens, degrading comprehension. Prior knowledge distillation methods overlook fine-grained vision differences caused by unbalanced tokens between student and teacher models.

Method: 1) Calculate Manhattan distance between teacher and student vision logits, align them spatially with Hungarian matching. 2) Apply Vision-Language Affinity Distillation (VLAD) using smooth L1 distance on affinity matrices. 3) Apply Vision Semantic Distillation (VSD) using reverse KL divergence on aligned vision logits.

Result: EM-KD trained models outperform prior Efficient MLLMs on both accuracy and efficiency by large margins. Also achieves better performance than previous distillation methods when equipped with the proposed vision token matching strategy.

Conclusion: EM-KD effectively enhances Efficient MLLMs through novel knowledge distillation paradigm that addresses vision token imbalance, demonstrating superior performance across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) compress vision tokens to reduce resource consumption, but the loss of visual information can degrade comprehension capabilities. Although some priors introduce Knowledge Distillation to enhance student models, they overlook the fundamental differences in fine-grained vision comprehension caused by unbalanced vision tokens between the efficient student and vanilla teacher. In this paper, we propose EM-KD, a novel paradigm that enhances the Efficient MLLMs with Knowledge Distillation. To overcome the challenge of unbalanced vision tokens, we first calculate the Manhattan distance between the vision logits of teacher and student, and then align them in the spatial dimension with the Hungarian matching algorithm. After alignment, EM-KD introduces two distillation strategies: 1) Vision-Language Affinity Distillation (VLAD) and 2) Vision Semantic Distillation (VSD). Specifically, VLAD calculates the affinity matrix between text tokens and aligned vision tokens, and minimizes the smooth L1 distance of the student and the teacher affinity matrices. Considering the semantic richness of vision logits in the final layer, VSD employs the reverse KL divergence to measure the discrete probability distributions of the aligned vision logits over the vocabulary space. Comprehensive evaluation on diverse benchmarks demonstrates that EM-KD trained model outperforms prior Efficient MLLMs on both accuracy and efficiency with a large margin, validating its effectiveness. Compared with previous distillation methods, which are equipped with our proposed vision token matching strategy for fair comparison, EM-KD also achieves better performance.

Method: Introduces Expected Information Gain (EIG) as a unified policy for coherent spatio-temporal synthesis - guiding diffusion as spatial prior to refine high-uncertainty regions and using pixel-level weighting to distill edits back into 3DGS.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on Waymo dataset across NTA-IoU, NTL-IoU, and FID metrics, maintaining FID of 107.47 even at 6 meters lane shift.

Conclusion: FaithFusion provides an effective plug-and-play system for controllable driving-scene reconstruction that maintains geometric fidelity without requiring extra prior conditions or structural modifications.

Abstract: In controllable driving-scene reconstruction and 3D scene generation, maintaining geometric fidelity while synthesizing visually plausible appearance under large viewpoint shifts is crucial. However, effective fusion of geometry-based 3DGS and appearance-driven diffusion models faces inherent challenges, as the absence of pixel-wise, 3D-consistent editing criteria often leads to over-restoration and geometric drift. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{FaithFusion}, a 3DGS-diffusion fusion framework driven by pixel-wise Expected Information Gain (EIG). EIG acts as a unified policy for coherent spatio-temporal synthesis: it guides diffusion as a spatial prior to refine high-uncertainty regions, while its pixel-level weighting distills the edits back into 3DGS. The resulting plug-and-play system is free from extra prior conditions and structural modifications.Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our approach attains SOTA performance across NTA-IoU, NTL-IoU, and FID, maintaining an FID of 107.47 even at 6 meters lane shift.

TL;DR: DATGN is a novel method that uses temporal generative networks to predict Alzheimer's disease progression by generating future MRI images, handling missing data through interpolation and improving classification accuracy when integrated with existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early prediction of Alzheimer's disease is crucial to slow progression, and current methods rely on manual feature extraction from brain images showing morphological changes like brain atrophy.

Method: Deformation-Aware Temporal Generative Network (DATGN) interpolates incomplete MRI sequences, then uses a bidirectional temporal deformation-aware module to generate future MRI images following disease progression patterns.

Result: DATGN achieved competitive PSNR and MMSE metrics, and when integrated with SVM/CNN/3DCNN classifiers, improved AD vs. NC accuracy by 6.21-16% and AD vs. MCI vs. NC accuracy by 7.34-21.25%. Generated images showed consistent brain atrophy trends.

Conclusion: DATGN successfully automates learning of morphological changes in brain images for early Alzheimer's prediction, producing realistic future MRI sequences that improve classification performance and align with disease progression patterns.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD), a degenerative brain condition, can benefit from early prediction to slow its progression. As the disease progresses, patients typically undergo brain atrophy. Current prediction methods for Alzheimers disease largely involve analyzing morphological changes in brain images through manual feature extraction. This paper proposes a novel method, the Deformation-Aware Temporal Generative Network (DATGN), to automate the learning of morphological changes in brain images about disease progression for early prediction. Given the common occurrence of missing data in the temporal sequences of MRI images, DATGN initially interpolates incomplete sequences. Subsequently, a bidirectional temporal deformation-aware module guides the network in generating future MRI images that adhere to the disease's progression, facilitating early prediction of Alzheimer's disease. DATGN was tested for the generation of temporal sequences of future MRI images using the ADNI dataset, and the experimental results are competitive in terms of PSNR and MMSE image quality metrics. Furthermore, when DATGN-generated synthetic data was integrated into the SVM vs. CNN vs. 3DCNN-based classification methods, significant improvements were achieved from 6. 21\% to 16\% in AD vs. NC classification accuracy and from 7. 34\% to 21. 25\% in AD vs. MCI vs. NC classification accuracy. The qualitative visualization results indicate that DATGN produces MRI images consistent with the brain atrophy trend in Alzheimer's disease, enabling early disease prediction.

TL;DR: EntPruner is an entropy-guided automatic progressive pruning framework for diffusion and flow models that reduces parameter redundancy while maintaining generation quality, achieving up to 2.22× inference speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale vision generative models have significant parameter redundancy when transferred to downstream tasks, and existing pruning methods designed for discriminative models don't preserve the diversity and condition-fidelity required for generative models.

Method: Uses entropy-guided pruning with Conditional Entropy Deviation (CED) metric to assess block importance, and a zero-shot adaptive pruning framework that automatically determines when and how much to prune during training.

Result: Achieved up to 2.22× inference speedup while maintaining competitive generation quality on ImageNet and three downstream datasets with DiT and SiT models.

Conclusion: EntPruner effectively reduces parameter redundancy in generative models while preserving output diversity and condition-fidelity, providing a practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion and flow models.

Abstract: Large-scale vision generative models, including diffusion and flow models, have demonstrated remarkable performance in visual generation tasks. However, transferring these pre-trained models to downstream tasks often results in significant parameter redundancy. In this paper, we propose EntPruner, an entropy-guided automatic progressive pruning framework for diffusion and flow models. First, we introduce entropy-guided pruning, a block-level importance assessment strategy specifically designed for generative models. Unlike discriminative models, generative models require preserving the diversity and condition-fidelity of the output distribution. As the importance of each module can vary significantly across downstream tasks, EntPruner prioritizes pruning of less important blocks using data-dependent Conditional Entropy Deviation (CED) as a guiding metric. CED quantifies how much the distribution diverges from the learned conditional data distribution after removing a block. Second, we propose a zero-shot adaptive pruning framework to automatically determine when and how much to prune during training. This dynamic strategy avoids the pitfalls of one-shot pruning, mitigating mode collapse, and preserving model performance. Extensive experiments on DiT and SiT models demonstrate the effectiveness of EntPruner, achieving up to 2.22$\times$ inference speedup while maintaining competitive generation quality on ImageNet and three downstream datasets.

TL;DR: CtrlVDiff is a unified diffusion model that handles both video understanding and controllable generation using multiple graphics-based modalities (depth, normals, segmentation, edges, albedo, roughness, metallic) with a Hybrid Modality Control Strategy for robust feature fusion and temporal coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geometry-only cues are insufficient for physically meaningful video edits as they under-constrain appearance, materials, and illumination, causing temporal drift. Adding graphics-based modalities provides complementary constraints for better understanding and precise control.

Method: Proposes CtrlVDiff with Hybrid Modality Control Strategy (HMCS) that routes and fuses features from multiple modalities, trained on MMVideo dataset - a hybrid real-and-synthetic dataset aligned across modalities and captions.

Result: Superior controllability and fidelity across understanding and generation benchmarks, enabling layer-wise edits (relighting, material adjustment, object insertion) and surpassing state-of-the-art baselines while remaining robust to missing modalities.

Conclusion: Enriching video models with graphics-based modalities enables precise, predictable control and physically meaningful edits while maintaining temporal coherence, overcoming limitations of geometry-only approaches.

Abstract: We tackle the dual challenges of video understanding and controllable video generation within a unified diffusion framework. Our key insights are two-fold: geometry-only cues (e.g., depth, edges) are insufficient: they specify layout but under-constrain appearance, materials, and illumination, limiting physically meaningful edits such as relighting or material swaps and often causing temporal drift. Enriching the model with additional graphics-based modalities (intrinsics and semantics) provides complementary constraints that both disambiguate understanding and enable precise, predictable control during generation.
  However, building a single model that uses many heterogeneous cues introduces two core difficulties. Architecturally, the model must accept any subset of modalities, remain robust to missing inputs, and inject control signals without sacrificing temporal consistency. Data-wise, training demands large-scale, temporally aligned supervision that ties real videos to per-pixel multimodal annotations.
  We then propose CtrlVDiff, a unified diffusion model trained with a Hybrid Modality Control Strategy (HMCS) that routes and fuses features from depth, normals, segmentation, edges, and graphics-based intrinsics (albedo, roughness, metallic), and re-renders videos from any chosen subset with strong temporal coherence. To enable this, we build MMVideo, a hybrid real-and-synthetic dataset aligned across modalities and captions. Across understanding and generation benchmarks, CtrlVDiff delivers superior controllability and fidelity, enabling layer-wise edits (relighting, material adjustment, object insertion) and surpassing state-of-the-art baselines while remaining robust when some modalities are unavailable.

*Xintian Mao,Haofei Song,Yin-Nian Liu,Qingli Li,Yan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Fourier Kernel Estimator (FKE) for kernel-level blur process learning in image deblurring, enabling networks to understand blur essence through Fourier space conversion and feature-based convolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep networks only perform pixel-level restoration, failing to understand the fundamental blur process which occurs at kernel-level through convolution operations.

Method: Fourier Kernel Estimator (FKE) converts spatial convolution to Fourier multiplication, uses feature-based convolution instead of image convolution, and employs decoupled multi-scale architecture with reversible sub-unets.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art motion deblurring performance, learns physically meaningful kernels, and shows potential for other kernel-related problems.

Conclusion: Kernel-level blur process learning through FKE significantly improves deblurring performance by enabling networks to understand the essence of blur with low complexity and no additional supervision.

Abstract: It is well-known that if a network aims to learn how to deblur, it should understand the blur process. Blurring is naturally caused by the convolution of the sharp image with the blur kernel. Thus, allowing the network to learn the blur process in the kernel-level can significantly improve the image deblurring performance. But, current deep networks are still at the pixel-level learning stage, either performing end-to-end pixel-level restoration or stage-wise pseudo kernel-level restoration, failing to enable the deblur model to understand the essence of the blur. To this end, we propose Fourier Kernel Estimator (FKE), which considers the activation operation in Fourier space and converts the convolution problem in the spatial domain to a multiplication problem in Fourier space. Our FKE, jointly optimized with the deblur model, enables the network to learn the kernel-level blur process with low complexity and without any additional supervision. Furthermore, we change the convolution object of the kernel from ``image" to network extracted ``feature", whose rich semantic and structural information is more suitable to blur process learning. With the convolution of the feature and the estimated kernel, our model can learn the essence of blur in kernel-level. To further improve the efficiency of feature extraction, we design a decoupled multi-scale architecture with multiple hierarchical sub-unets with a reversible strategy, which allows better multi-scale encoding and decoding in low training memory. Extensive experiments indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art motion deblurring results and show potential for handling other kernel-related problems. Analysis also shows our kernel estimator is able to learn physically meaningful kernels. The code will be available at https://github.com/DeepMed-Lab-ECNU/Single-Image-Deblur.

TL;DR: Ent-Prog is an efficient training framework for human video generation using diffusion models, reducing training time by 2.2x and GPU memory by 2.4x without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational cost and memory consumption in training diffusion models for high-resolution human video generation pose significant challenges.

Method: Uses Conditional Entropy Inflation to prioritize critical model components and adaptive progressive schedule to increase computational complexity based on convergence efficiency.

Result: Achieved up to 2.2x training speedup and 2.4x GPU memory reduction across three datasets while maintaining generative performance.

Conclusion: Ent-Prog provides an effective solution for efficient training of diffusion models in human video generation, addressing computational and memory constraints.

Abstract: Human video generation has advanced rapidly with the development of diffusion models, but the high computational cost and substantial memory consumption associated with training these models on high-resolution, multi-frame data pose significant challenges. In this paper, we propose Entropy-Guided Prioritized Progressive Learning (Ent-Prog), an efficient training framework tailored for diffusion models on human video generation. First, we introduce Conditional Entropy Inflation (CEI) to assess the importance of different model components on the target conditional generation task, enabling prioritized training of the most critical components. Second, we introduce an adaptive progressive schedule that adaptively increases computational complexity during training by measuring the convergence efficiency. Ent-Prog reduces both training time and GPU memory consumption while maintaining model performance. Extensive experiments across three datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of Ent-Prog, achieving up to 2.2$\times$ training speedup and 2.4$\times$ GPU memory reduction without compromising generative performance.

### [58] [Referring Video Object Segmentation with Cross-Modality Proxy Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21139)
*Baoli Sun,Xinzhu Ma,Ning Wang,Zhihui Wang,Zhiyong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProxyFormer introduces proxy queries to integrate visual and text semantics for referring video object segmentation, addressing limitations in cross-modality alignment and inter-frame dependency modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RVOS methods have two key limitations: conditional queries lack inter-frame dependency modeling, making accurate tracking difficult amid frame variations, and they integrate textual constraints too late, potentially focusing on non-referred objects.

Method: ProxyFormer uses proxy queries to integrate visual and text semantics, progressively updating them across video feature encoder stages. It decouples cross-modality interactions into temporal and spatial dimensions for efficiency, and employs Joint Semantic Consistency training for alignment.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on four RVOS benchmarks demonstrate ProxyFormer's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, showing improved accuracy and coherence in object tracking.

Conclusion: ProxyFormer effectively addresses cross-modality alignment challenges in RVOS through proxy queries and semantic consistency training, achieving state-of-the-art performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) is an emerging cross-modality task that aims to generate pixel-level maps of the target objects referred by given textual expressions. The main concept involves learning an accurate alignment of visual elements and language expressions within a semantic space. Recent approaches address cross-modality alignment through conditional queries, tracking the target object using a query-response based mechanism built upon transformer structure. However, they exhibit two limitations: (1) these conditional queries lack inter-frame dependency and variation modeling, making accurate target tracking challenging amid significant frame-to-frame variations; and (2) they integrate textual constraints belatedly, which may cause the video features potentially focus on the non-referred objects. Therefore, we propose a novel RVOS architecture called ProxyFormer, which introduces a set of proxy queries to integrate visual and text semantics and facilitate the flow of semantics between them. By progressively updating and propagating proxy queries across multiple stages of video feature encoder, ProxyFormer ensures that the video features are focused on the object of interest. This dynamic evolution also enables the establishment of inter-frame dependencies, enhancing the accuracy and coherence of object tracking. To mitigate high computational costs, we decouple cross-modality interactions into temporal and spatial dimensions. Additionally, we design a Joint Semantic Consistency (JSC) training strategy to align semantic consensus between the proxy queries and the combined video-text pairs. Comprehensive experiments on four widely used RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our ProxyFormer to the state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TEAR is an automated red-teaming framework that uncovers safety risks in Text-to-Video models by exploiting temporal dynamics through temporal-aware test generation and preference learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety evaluation methods for static image and text generation are insufficient for capturing the complex temporal dynamics and safety risks in video generation models.

Method: TEAR employs a temporal-aware test generator with two-stage optimization (initial training and temporal-aware online preference learning) and uses a refine model to cyclically improve prompt stealthiness and adversarial effectiveness.

Result: TEAR achieves over 80% attack success rate across open-source and commercial T2V systems, significantly outperforming prior best results of 57%.

Conclusion: The framework effectively uncovers critical safety vulnerabilities in T2V models by specifically targeting temporal dynamics, demonstrating the need for temporal-aware safety evaluation methods.

Abstract: Text-to-Video (T2V) models are capable of synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent dynamic video content, but the diverse generation also inherently introduces critical safety challenges. Existing safety evaluation methods,which focus on static image and text generation, are insufficient to capture the complex temporal dynamics in video generation. To address this, we propose a TEmporal-aware Automated Red-teaming framework, named TEAR, an automated framework designed to uncover safety risks specifically linked to the dynamic temporal sequencing of T2V models. TEAR employs a temporal-aware test generator optimized via a two-stage approach: initial generator training and temporal-aware online preference learning, to craft textually innocuous prompts that exploit temporal dynamics to elicit policy-violating video output. And a refine model is adopted to improve the prompt stealthiness and adversarial effectiveness cyclically. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of TEAR across open-source and commercial T2V systems with over 80% attack success rate, a significant boost from prior best result of 57%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLaVA-UHD v3 introduces Progressive Visual Compression (PVC) to enable efficient native-resolution visual encoding in MLLMs, reducing computational overhead while maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global native-resolution visual encoding in MLLMs enhances capability but incurs significant computational overhead, creating a need for more efficient encoding methods.

Method: Progressive Visual Compression (PVC) with two modules: refined patch embedding for flexible patch-size scaling, and windowed token compression hierarchically deployed across ViT layers to progressively aggregate local token representations.

Result: ViT-UHD achieves competitive performance with MoonViT while reducing TTFT by 2.4x, and LLaVA-UHD v3 achieves competitive performance to Qwen2-VL while reducing TTFT by 1.9x.

Conclusion: PVC enables efficient native-resolution encoding in MLLMs, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining competitive performance, supporting future research on efficient multi-modal models.

Abstract: Visual encoding followed by token condensing has become the standard architectural paradigm in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Many recent MLLMs increasingly favor global native- resolution visual encoding over slice-based methods. To investigate this trend, we systematically compare their behavior on vision-language understanding and attention patterns, revealing that global encoding enhances overall capability but at the expense of greater computational overhead. To address this issue, we present LLaVA-UHD v3, an MLLM centered upon our proposed Progressive Visual Compression (PVC) method, which can be seamlessly integrated into standard Vision Transformer (ViT) to enable efficient native-resolution encoding. The PVC approach consists of two key modules: (i) refined patch embedding, which supports flexible patch-size scaling for fine-grained visual model- ing, (ii) windowed token compression, hierarchically deployed across ViT layers to progressively aggregate local token representations. Jointly modulated by these two modules, a widely pretrained ViT can be reconfigured into an efficient architecture while largely preserving generality. Evaluated across extensive benchmarks, the transformed ViT, termed ViT-UHD, demonstrates competitive performance with MoonViT while reducing TTFT (time-to-first-token) by 2.4x, when developed within an identical MLLM architecture. Building upon ViT-UHD, LLaVA-UHD v3 also achieves competitive performance to Qwen2-VL, while further reducing TTFT by 1.9x. We will release all code and checkpoints to support future research on efficient MLLMs.

### [61] [Progress by Pieces: Test-Time Scaling for Autoregressive Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21185)
*Joonhyung Park,Hyeongwon Jang,Joowon Kim,Eunho Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GridAR introduces a test-time scaling framework for visual autoregressive models that uses grid-partitioned progressive generation with early pruning and layout-specified prompt reformulation to improve image generation quality while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current test-time scaling strategies like Best-of-N are suboptimal for visual AR models because they consume full computation on erroneous trajectories and lack a blueprint of the entire canvas, limiting scaling benefits.

Method: GridAR employs grid-partitioned progressive generation where multiple partial candidates are generated, infeasible ones are pruned early, and viable ones become anchors to guide subsequent decoding. It also uses layout-specified prompt reformulation to infer feasible layouts from partial views.

Result: GridAR achieves higher-quality results with less computation: with N=4, it outperforms Best-of-N (N=8) by 14.4% on T2I-CompBench++ while reducing cost by 25.6%. It also shows comparable edit quality and 13.9% gain in semantic preservation on PIE-Bench.

Conclusion: GridAR effectively addresses the blueprint deficiency in visual AR models through progressive generation and layout inference, enabling better test-time scaling performance for both text-to-image generation and image editing tasks.

Abstract: Recent visual autoregressive (AR) models have shown promising capabilities in text-to-image generation, operating in a manner similar to large language models. While test-time computation scaling has brought remarkable success in enabling reasoning-enhanced outputs for challenging natural language tasks, its adaptation to visual AR models remains unexplored and poses unique challenges. Naively applying test-time scaling strategies such as Best-of-N can be suboptimal: they consume full-length computation on erroneous generation trajectories, while the raster-scan decoding scheme lacks a blueprint of the entire canvas, limiting scaling benefits as only a few prompt-aligned candidates are generated. To address these, we introduce GridAR, a test-time scaling framework designed to elicit the best possible results from visual AR models. GridAR employs a grid-partitioned progressive generation scheme in which multiple partial candidates for the same position are generated within a canvas, infeasible ones are pruned early, and viable ones are fixed as anchors to guide subsequent decoding. Coupled with this, we present a layout-specified prompt reformulation strategy that inspects partial views to infer a feasible layout for satisfying the prompt. The reformulated prompt then guides subsequent image generation to mitigate the blueprint deficiency. Together, GridAR achieves higher-quality results under limited test-time scaling: with N=4, it even outperforms Best-of-N (N=8) by 14.4% on T2I-CompBench++ while reducing cost by 25.6%. It also generalizes to autoregressive image editing, showing comparable edit quality and a 13.9% gain in semantic preservation on PIE-Bench over larger-N baselines.

### [62] [AnchorOPT: Towards Optimizing Dynamic Anchors for Adaptive Prompt Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21188)
*Zheng Li,Yibing Song,Xin Zhang,Lei Luo,Xiang Li,Jian Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnchorOPT introduces dynamic anchor-based prompt learning with learnable anchor values and adaptive positional relationships between anchors and soft tokens, achieving competitive performance without additional modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt learning methods use static textual tokens as anchors, lacking cross-task and stage-adaptive flexibility, which limits CLIP model generalization capabilities.

Method: Two-stage training: first learn dynamic anchor tokens from task-specific data, then freeze anchors and optimize soft tokens and learnable position matrix. Introduces dynamism in both anchor values and positional relationships.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to or exceeding methods with additional learnable modules or regularization techniques. Works as plug-and-play module with consistent gains across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: Dynamic anchor-based prompt learning with learnable anchors and adaptive positions effectively improves CLIP generalization without complex additional components.

Abstract: Existing prompt learning methods, which are built upon CLIP models, leverage textual tokens as anchors to guide the learnable soft tokens. This guidance improves CLIP generalizations. However, these anchors-static in both value and position-lack cross-task and stage-adaptive flexibility. To address this limitation, we propose AnchorOPT, a dynamic anchor-based prompt learning framework. Specifically, AnchorOPT introduces dynamism in two key dimensions: (i) anchor values eschew handcrafted explicit textual tokens (e.g., "shape", "color"), instead learning dynamically from task-specific data; and (ii) the positional relationship between anchor and soft tokens is no longer fixed but adaptively optimized via a learnable position matrix conditioned on the training stage and task context. Training occurs in two stages: we first learn the anchor tokens, then freeze and transfer them to the second stage for optimization of soft tokens and the position matrix. Extensive experiments demonstrate that using only a simple learnable anchor and position matrix achieves performance comparable to or exceeding some methods incorporating additional learnable modules or regularization techniques. As a plug-and-play module, AnchorOPT integrates seamlessly into existing frameworks, yielding consistent performance gains across diverse datasets.

Motivation: Effectively tokenizing 3D scenes into holistic scene tokens and leveraging them across diverse 3D understanding tasks remains challenging, despite recent advances in 3D vision-language models.

Method: Uses a three-stage scene tokenization pipeline with Multi-Scale NDT representation and Multi-Scale NDT Decoder (MSDec) to construct multi-scale representations from point clouds, fuse cross-scale features, and produce holistic scene tokens for LLM endpoints.

Result: Achieves remarkable improvements in 3D Referring Segmentation, 3D Visual Question Answering, and 3D Dense Captioning tasks.

Conclusion: NDTokenizer3D provides a compact and unified design for a fine-grained, general-purpose 3D VLM that naturally supports human interactions and unifies diverse 3D scene understanding tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D vision-language models (VLMs) highlight a strong potential for 3D scene understanding and reasoning. However, effectively tokenizing 3D scenes into holistic scene tokens, and leveraging these tokens across diverse 3D understanding tasks, remain highly challenging. We present NDTokenizer3D, a generalist 3D VLM that performs a wide range of 3D scene understanding tasks while naturally supporting human interactions, thereby bridging language-level reasoning with 3D spatial understanding. The core of our approach is a novel three-stage scene tokenization pipeline built upon a Multi-Scale Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) representation, paired with a Multi-Scale NDT Decoder (MSDec). Specifically, NDTokenizer3D first constructs a multi-scale NDT representation from raw high-resolution point clouds, preserving both global context and fine-grained geometric details. Next, the MSDec progressively fuses cross-scale NDT features, producing holistic scene tokens consumable by LLM endpoints. Beyond tokenization, MSDec is repurposed as a general interface for human-interactive prompting (points, boxes, masks) and segmentation-mask decoding, unifying diverse 3D scene understanding tasks within a single architecture. With this compact and unified design, NDTokenizer3D offers a fine-grained, general-purpose 3D VLM, achieving remarkable improvements in 3D Referring Segmentation, 3D Visual Question Answering, and 3D Dense Captioning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language-Action models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, but existing patches overfit to single models and fail in black-box settings, leaving universal and transferable attacks underexplored.

Method: UPA-RFAS combines: (1) feature-space objective with ℓ1 prior and repulsive InfoNCE loss, (2) two-phase min-max procedure with invisible perturbations, (3) VLA-specific Patch Attention Dominance and Patch Semantic Misalignment losses.

Result: Experiments show UPA-RFAS consistently transfers across diverse VLA models, manipulation suites, and physical executions, exposing a practical patch-based attack surface.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a strong baseline for universal adversarial patches against VLA-driven robots and highlights the need for future defenses.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, yet universal and transferable attacks remain underexplored, as most existing patches overfit to a single model and fail in black-box settings. To address this gap, we present a systematic study of universal, transferable adversarial patches against VLA-driven robots under unknown architectures, finetuned variants, and sim-to-real shifts. We introduce UPA-RFAS (Universal Patch Attack via Robust Feature, Attention, and Semantics), a unified framework that learns a single physical patch in a shared feature space while promoting cross-model transfer. UPA-RFAS combines (i) a feature-space objective with an $\ell_1$ deviation prior and repulsive InfoNCE loss to induce transferable representation shifts, (ii) a robustness-augmented two-phase min-max procedure where an inner loop learns invisible sample-wise perturbations and an outer loop optimizes the universal patch against this hardened neighborhood, and (iii) two VLA-specific losses: Patch Attention Dominance to hijack text$\to$vision attention and Patch Semantic Misalignment to induce image-text mismatch without labels. Experiments across diverse VLA models, manipulation suites, and physical executions show that UPA-RFAS consistently transfers across models, tasks, and viewpoints, exposing a practical patch-based attack surface and establishing a strong baseline for future defenses.

TL;DR: DCBoost is a parameter-free plug-in that enhances deep clustering models by using reliable local structural cues to improve global feature structures, significantly boosting clustering performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep clustering methods suffer from disparity between well-structured local features and poorly separated global features, leading to intertwined cluster boundaries.

Method: Uses adaptive k-nearest neighbors-based consistency filtering to identify high-confidence samples as anchors, then applies discriminative loss for intra-class compactness and inter-class separability.

Result: Significantly improves clustering performance across various benchmarks, boosting state-of-the-art baselines by over 3% and amplifying silhouette coefficient by 7x.

Conclusion: DCBoost effectively bridges the gap between local and global feature structures in deep clustering, providing substantial performance improvements without additional parameters.

Abstract: Recent deep clustering models have produced impressive clustering performance. However, a common issue with existing methods is the disparity between global and local feature structures. While local structures typically show strong consistency and compactness within class samples, global features often present intertwined boundaries and poorly separated clusters. Motivated by this observation, we propose DCBoost, a parameter-free plug-in designed to enhance the global feature structures of current deep clustering models. By harnessing reliable local structural cues, our method aims to elevate clustering performance effectively. Specifically, we first identify high-confidence samples through adaptive $k$-nearest neighbors-based consistency filtering, aiming to select a sufficient number of samples with high label reliability to serve as trustworthy anchors for self-supervision. Subsequently, these samples are utilized to compute a discriminative loss, which promotes both intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, to guide network optimization. Extensive experiments across various benchmark datasets showcase that our DCBoost significantly improves the clustering performance of diverse existing deep clustering models. Notably, our method improves the performance of current state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., ProPos) by more than 3% and amplifies the silhouette coefficient by over $7\times$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To adapt foundation models for domain-specific tasks without expensive retraining, enabling frugal representation learning for data-scarce ecological applications.

Method: Multimodal contrastive learning framework that aligns high-resolution aerial imagery with botanical relevés, using regularization to prevent catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained knowledge.

Result: Consistent improvements over DOFA and supervised baselines in plant presence prediction, butterfly occurrence modeling, and soil trophic group abundance estimation.

Conclusion: Domain-aware adaptation of foundation models can effectively inject expert knowledge into data-scarce settings, enabling efficient representation learning for ecological applications.

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated a remarkable ability to learn rich, transferable representations across diverse modalities such as images, text, and audio. In modern machine learning pipelines, these representations often replace raw data as the primary input for downstream tasks. In this paper, we address the challenge of adapting a pre-trained foundation model to inject domain-specific knowledge, without retraining from scratch or incurring significant computational costs. To this end, we introduce BotaCLIP, a lightweight multimodal contrastive framework that adapts a pre-trained Earth Observation foundation model (DOFA) by aligning high-resolution aerial imagery with botanical relevés. Unlike generic embeddings, BotaCLIP internalizes ecological structure through contrastive learning with a regularization strategy that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Once trained, the resulting embeddings serve as transferable representations for downstream predictors. Motivated by real-world applications in biodiversity modeling, we evaluated BotaCLIP representations in three ecological tasks: plant presence prediction, butterfly occurrence modeling, and soil trophic group abundance estimation. The results showed consistent improvements over those derived from DOFA and supervised baselines. More broadly, this work illustrates how domain-aware adaptation of foundation models can inject expert knowledge into data-scarce settings, enabling frugal representation learning.

TL;DR: The paper proposes ART framework for fine-grained action recognition using query-response mechanism to track distinctive local details across video frames, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current action recognition methods capture coarse-grained motion patterns but struggle with subtle local details that evolve over time, which are crucial for distinguishing similar fine-grained actions.

Method: Uses region-specific semantic activation module with text-constrained queries from VLMs to capture action-related regions, organizes responses into action tracklets, and applies multi-level tracklet contrastive constraints with task-specific fine-tuning.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show superiority over previous state-of-the-art baselines on widely used action recognition benchmarks.

Conclusion: The ART framework effectively discovers and tracks distinctive local details through query-response mechanism and action tracklets, enabling better discrimination of fine-grained actions.

Abstract: Fine-grained action recognition (FGAR) aims to identify subtle and distinctive differences among fine-grained action categories. However, current recognition methods often capture coarse-grained motion patterns but struggle to identify subtle details in local regions evolving over time. In this work, we introduce the Action-Region Tracking (ART) framework, a novel solution leveraging a query-response mechanism to discover and track the dynamics of distinctive local details, enabling effective distinction of similar actions. Specifically, we propose a region-specific semantic activation module that employs discriminative and text-constrained semantics as queries to capture the most action-related region responses in each video frame, facilitating interaction among spatial and temporal dimensions with corresponding video features. The captured region responses are organized into action tracklets, which characterize region-based action dynamics by linking related responses across video frames in a coherent sequence. The text-constrained queries encode nuanced semantic representations derived from textual descriptions of action labels extracted by language branches within Visual Language Models (VLMs). To optimize the action tracklets, we design a multi-level tracklet contrastive constraint among region responses at spatial and temporal levels, enabling effective discrimination within each frame and correlation between adjacent frames. Additionally, a task-specific fine-tuning mechanism refines textual semantics such that semantic representations encoded by VLMs are preserved while optimized for task preferences. Comprehensive experiments on widely used action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the superiority to previous state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: Comparative study of DDPM, CFM, and MeanFlow generative models showing CFM outperforms DDPM (FID 24.15 vs 402.98) and MeanFlow enables 50X faster single-step generation (FID 29.15).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compare different generative modeling paradigms and explore efficient sampling methods, particularly focusing on reducing iterative sampling requirements.

Method: Implemented DDPM, CFM, and MeanFlow using unified TinyUNet architecture on CIFAR-10, with CFM extended to image inpainting using four mask types and mask-guided sampling.

Result: CFM achieved FID 24.15 (50 steps), significantly better than DDPM's 402.98. MeanFlow achieved FID 29.15 with single-step sampling. Inpainting improved PSNR from 4.95 to 8.57 dB (+73%) and SSIM from 0.289 to 0.418 (+45%).

Conclusion: CFM is superior to DDPM for iterative sampling, while MeanFlow offers dramatic speedup with competitive quality. Inpainting-aware training significantly improves reconstruction quality.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive comparative study of three generative modeling paradigms: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM), Conditional Flow Matching (CFM), and MeanFlow. While DDPM and CFM require iterative sampling, MeanFlow enables direct one-step generation by modeling the average velocity over time intervals. We implement all three methods using a unified TinyUNet architecture (<1.5M parameters) on CIFAR-10, demonstrating that CFM achieves an FID of 24.15 with 50 steps, significantly outperforming DDPM (FID 402.98). MeanFlow achieves FID 29.15 with single-step sampling -- a 50X reduction in inference time. We further extend CFM to image inpainting, implementing mask-guided sampling with four mask types (center, random bbox, irregular, half). Our fine-tuned inpainting model achieves substantial improvements: PSNR increases from 4.95 to 8.57 dB on center masks (+73%), and SSIM improves from 0.289 to 0.418 (+45%), demonstrating the effectiveness of inpainting-aware training.

*Shuhan Xia,Xuannan Liu,Xing Cui,Peipei Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T3-Tracer is a novel framework for detecting partial audio forgeries by jointly analyzing audio at frame, segment, and audio levels using two complementary modules: FA-FAM for frame authenticity and SMDAM for segment-level boundary detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Partial audio forgeries selectively modify semantically critical frames while preserving overall perceptual authenticity, making them difficult to detect with existing methods that only analyze single frames independently without hierarchical temporal structure.

Method: T3-Tracer uses two core modules: FA-FAM combines frame-level and audio-level temporal information to detect intra-frame forgery cues and global inconsistencies, while SMDAM employs a dual-branch architecture to model frame features and inter-frame differences across multi-scale temporal windows for boundary detection.

Result: Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate that T3-Tracer achieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting partial audio forgeries.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical framework effectively captures both transient and sustained anomalies across different temporal levels, providing comprehensive detection of partial audio forgery traces that existing single-frame approaches miss.

Abstract: Recently, partial audio forgery has emerged as a new form of audio manipulation. Attackers selectively modify partial but semantically critical frames while preserving the overall perceptual authenticity, making such forgeries particularly difficult to detect. Existing methods focus on independently detecting whether a single frame is forged, lacking the hierarchical structure to capture both transient and sustained anomalies across different temporal levels. To address these limitations, We identify three key levels relevant to partial audio forgery detection and present T3-Tracer, the first framework that jointly analyzes audio at the frame, segment, and audio levels to comprehensively detect forgery traces. T3-Tracer consists of two complementary core modules: the Frame-Audio Feature Aggregation Module (FA-FAM) and the Segment-level Multi-Scale Discrepancy-Aware Module (SMDAM). FA-FAM is designed to detect the authenticity of each audio frame. It combines both frame-level and audio-level temporal information to detect intra-frame forgery cues and global semantic inconsistencies. To further refine and correct frame detection, we introduce SMDAM to detect forgery boundaries at the segment level. It adopts a dual-branch architecture that jointly models frame features and inter-frame differences across multi-scale temporal windows, effectively identifying abrupt anomalies that appeared on the forged boundaries. Extensive experiments conducted on three challenging datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.

*Chen Ling,Henglin Shi,Hedvig Kjellström*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FIELDS improves 3D face reconstruction by combining 2D image consistency with direct 3D expression supervision and emotion recognition, enabling accurate capture of subtle emotional details from single images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D face reconstruction methods fail to capture subtle emotional details due to reliance on 2D supervision and lack of 3D ground truth, limiting their ability to convey authentic facial expressions.

Method: Extends self-supervised 2D image consistency with direct 3D expression parameter supervision from spontaneous 4D facial scans and an auxiliary emotion recognition branch with intensity-aware emotion loss.

Result: Produces high-fidelity 3D reconstructions that preserve subtle emotional cues, significantly improving in-the-wild facial expression recognition performance while maintaining naturalness.

Conclusion: FIELDS successfully bridges the 2D/3D domain gap and mitigates expression-intensity bias, enabling emotion-rich face models with realistic expressions from single images.

Abstract: Facial expressions convey the bulk of emotional information in human communication, yet existing 3D face reconstruction methods often miss subtle affective details due to reliance on 2D supervision and lack of 3D ground truth. We propose FIELDS (Face reconstruction with accurate Inference of Expression using Learning with Direct Supervision) to address these limitations by extending self-supervised 2D image consistency cues with direct 3D expression parameter supervision and an auxiliary emotion recognition branch. Our encoder is guided by authentic expression parameters from spontaneous 4D facial scans, while an intensity-aware emotion loss encourages the 3D expression parameters to capture genuine emotion content without exaggeration. This dual-supervision strategy bridges the 2D/3D domain gap and mitigates expression-intensity bias, yielding high-fidelity 3D reconstructions that preserve subtle emotional cues. From a single image, FIELDS produces emotion-rich face models with highly realistic expressions, significantly improving in-the-wild facial expression recognition performance without sacrificing naturalness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Extends Learnable Polyphase Sampling (LPS) to complex-valued neural networks with a novel projection layer from complex to real space before Gumbel Softmax, achieving shift equivariance and invariance in computer vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CNNs lack shift equivariance and invariance due to downsampling/upsampling operations. While data augmentation helps empirically, a systematic theoretical approach is needed to guarantee these properties by construction.

Method: Extends LPS to complex-valued networks with a projection layer from C to R before Gumbel Softmax, building on Adaptive Polyphase Sampling foundation for shift invariance.

Result: Evaluated on computer vision problems including classification (invariance) and reconstruction/semantic segmentation (equivariance) using polarimetric SAR images.

Conclusion: Successfully extends shift equivariant/invariant downsampling/upsampling to complex-valued neural networks, providing theoretical guarantees for these critical properties.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks have shown remarkable performance in recent years on various computer vision problems. However, the traditional convolutional neural network architecture lacks a critical property: shift equivariance and invariance, broken by downsampling and upsampling operations. Although data augmentation techniques can help the model learn the latter property empirically, a consistent and systematic way to achieve this goal is by designing downsampling and upsampling layers that theoretically guarantee these properties by construction. Adaptive Polyphase Sampling (APS) introduced the cornerstone for shift invariance, later extended to shift equivariance with Learnable Polyphase up/downsampling (LPS) applied to real-valued neural networks. In this paper, we extend the work on LPS to complex-valued neural networks both from a theoretical perspective and with a novel building block of a projection layer from $\mathbb{C}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ before the Gumbel Softmax. We finally evaluate this extension on several computer vision problems, specifically for either the invariance property in classification tasks or the equivariance property in both reconstruction and semantic segmentation problems, using polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar images.

TL;DR: AVFakeBench is the first comprehensive audio-video forgery detection benchmark covering diverse forgery types across human and general subjects, with multi-level annotations and multi-task evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks are limited to DeepFake-based forgeries and single-granularity annotations, failing to capture the diversity and complexity of real-world audio-video forgery scenarios.

Method: Created AVFakeBench with 12K audio-video questions covering 7 forgery types and 4 annotation levels, using a multi-stage hybrid forgery framework that integrates proprietary models for task planning with expert generative models for precise manipulation.

Result: Evaluation of 11 AV-LMMs and 2 detection methods shows AV-LMMs have potential as forgery detectors but exhibit notable weaknesses in fine-grained perception and reasoning.

Conclusion: AVFakeBench establishes a comprehensive benchmark for audio-video forgery detection, revealing both the promise and limitations of current AV-LMMs in detecting complex forgeries.

Abstract: The threat of Audio-Video (AV) forgery is rapidly evolving beyond human-centric deepfakes to include more diverse manipulations across complex natural scenes. However, existing benchmarks are still confined to DeepFake-based forgeries and single-granularity annotations, thus failing to capture the diversity and complexity of real-world forgery scenarios. To address this, we introduce AVFakeBench, the first comprehensive audio-video forgery detection benchmark that spans rich forgery semantics across both human subject and general subject. AVFakeBench comprises 12K carefully curated audio-video questions, covering seven forgery types and four levels of annotations. To ensure high-quality and diverse forgeries, we propose a multi-stage hybrid forgery framework that integrates proprietary models for task planning with expert generative models for precise manipulation. The benchmark establishes a multi-task evaluation framework covering binary judgment, forgery types classification, forgery detail selection, and explanatory reasoning. We evaluate 11 Audio-Video Large Language Models (AV-LMMs) and 2 prevalent detection methods on AVFakeBench, demonstrating the potential of AV-LMMs as emerging forgery detectors while revealing their notable weaknesses in fine-grained perception and reasoning.

*Sizhuo Zhou,Xiaosong Jia,Fanrui Zhang,Junjie Li,Juyong Zhang,Yukang Feng,Jianwen Sun,Songbur Wong,Junqi You,Junchi Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LaGen is the first framework for autoregressive long-horizon LiDAR scene generation, enabling frame-by-frame generation from single-frame input with bounding box conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LiDAR generation methods only support single frame generation, while prediction methods require multiple historical frames and lack interactivity, both failing to support long-horizon interactive generation.

Method: LaGen uses single-frame LiDAR input with bounding box conditions, includes scene decoupling estimation for object-level interaction, and noise modulation to reduce error accumulation in long sequences.

Result: LaGen outperforms state-of-the-art LiDAR generation and prediction models, especially on later frames, demonstrating superior long-horizon generation capability.

Conclusion: LaGen successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods by enabling interactive, autoregressive long-horizon LiDAR scene generation with improved performance.

Abstract: Generative world models for autonomous driving (AD) have become a trending topic. Unlike the widely studied image modality, in this work we explore generative world models for LiDAR data. Existing generation methods for LiDAR data only support single frame generation, while existing prediction approaches require multiple frames of historical input and can only deterministically predict multiple frames at once, lacking interactivity. Both paradigms fail to support long-horizon interactive generation. To this end, we introduce LaGen, which to the best of our knowledge is the first framework capable of frame-by-frame autoregressive generation of long-horizon LiDAR scenes. LaGen is able to take a single-frame LiDAR input as a starting point and effectively utilize bounding box information as conditions to generate high-fidelity 4D scene point clouds. In addition, we introduce a scene decoupling estimation module to enhance the model's interactive generation capability for object-level content, as well as a noise modulation module to mitigate error accumulation during long-horizon generation. We construct a protocol based on nuScenes for evaluating long-horizon LiDAR scene generation. Experimental results comprehensively demonstrate LaGen outperforms state-of-the-art LiDAR generation and prediction models, especially on the later frames.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MatchGS is a framework that corrects 3D Gaussian Splatting's geometric inaccuracies to generate high-quality training data for image matching, enabling significant zero-shot performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning-based image matching requires large-scale, diverse, and geometrically accurate training data. While 3DGS enables photorealistic novel-view synthesis, its geometric inaccuracies and biased depth rendering prevent robust correspondence labeling.

Method: Two-fold approach: (1) geometrically-faithful data generation pipeline that refines 3DGS geometry for precise correspondence labels, and (2) 2D-3D representation alignment strategy that infuses 3DGS' explicit 3D knowledge into 2D matchers.

Result: Generated ground-truth correspondences reduce epipolar error by up to 40x compared to existing datasets. State-of-the-art matchers trained on MatchGS data achieve up to 17.7% zero-shot performance gains on public benchmarks.

Conclusion: With proper geometric refinement, 3DGS can serve as a scalable, high-fidelity, and structurally-rich data source for training robust zero-shot image matchers.

Abstract: Learning-based image matching critically depends on large-scale, diverse, and geometrically accurate training data. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables photorealistic novel-view synthesis and thus is attractive for data generation. However, its geometric inaccuracies and biased depth rendering currently prevent robust correspondence labeling. To address this, we introduce MatchGS, the first framework designed to systematically correct and leverage 3DGS for robust, zero-shot image matching. Our approach is twofold: (1) a geometrically-faithful data generation pipeline that refines 3DGS geometry to produce highly precise correspondence labels, enabling the synthesis of a vast and diverse range of viewpoints without compromising rendering fidelity; and (2) a 2D-3D representation alignment strategy that infuses 3DGS' explicit 3D knowledge into the 2D matcher, guiding 2D semi-dense matchers to learn viewpoint-invariant 3D representations. Our generated ground-truth correspondences reduce the epipolar error by up to 40 times compared to existing datasets, enable supervision under extreme viewpoint changes, and provide self-supervisory signals through Gaussian attributes. Consequently, state-of-the-art matchers trained solely on our data achieve significant zero-shot performance gains on public benchmarks, with improvements of up to 17.7%. Our work demonstrates that with proper geometric refinement, 3DGS can serve as a scalable, high-fidelity, and structurally-rich data source, paving the way for a new generation of robust zero-shot image matchers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified model for multiple remote sensing tasks through multi-task learning, leveraging vision-language models' text-based interface and addressing challenges like diverse image scales and computational burdens in ultra-high-resolution imagery.

Method: Proposes data curation engine for vision-language conversations, unified dynamic-resolution strategy for diverse image scales, Zoom-in Chain mechanism for UHR images, and enhanced object detection capability with novel evaluation protocol.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse remote sensing tasks, outperforming existing RS VLMs and rivaling specialized expert models.

Conclusion: RSCoVLM serves as an effective baseline that promotes progress toward general-purpose remote sensing models, with all tools, models, and datasets open-sourced for reproducibility.

Abstract: With Transformers achieving outstanding performance on individual remote sensing (RS) tasks, we are now approaching the realization of a unified model that excels across multiple tasks through multi-task learning (MTL). Compared to single-task approaches, MTL methods offer improved generalization, enhanced scalability, and greater practical applicability. Recently, vision language models (VLMs) have achieved promising results in RS image understanding, grounding, and ultra-high-resolution (UHR) image reasoning, respectively. Moreover, the unified text-based interface demonstrates significant potential for MTL. Hence, in this work, we present RSCoVLM, a simple yet flexible VLM baseline for RS MTL. Firstly, we create the data curation engine, including data acquisition, offline processing and integrating, as well as online loading and weighting. This data engine effectively addresses complex RS data enviroment and generates flexible vision-language conversations. Furthermore, we propose a unified dynamic-resolution strategy to address the diverse image scales inherent in RS imagery. For UHR images, we introduce the Zoom-in Chain mechanism together with its corresponding dataset, LRS-VQA-Zoom. The strategies are flexible and effectively mitigate the computational burdens. Additionally, we significantly enhance the model's object detection capability and propose a novel evaluation protocol that ensures fair comparison between VLMs and conventional detection models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSCoVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks, outperforming existing RS VLMs and even rivaling specialized expert models. All the training and evaluating tools, model weights, and datasets have been fully open-sourced to support reproducibility. We expect that this baseline will promote further progress toward general-purpose RS models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve both high accuracy and topological continuity in road segmentation from satellite imagery, addressing the limitations of Vision Transformers' quadratic complexity and leveraging the complementary strengths of Mamba for modeling long, continuous structures.

Method: Introduces PathMamba, a hybrid architecture that integrates Mamba blocks for tracing continuous road networks and preserving topological structure, combined with Transformer blocks for refining features with global context.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art on DeepGlobe Road Extraction and Massachusetts Roads datasets, significantly improving topological continuity (APLS metric) while remaining computationally competitive.

Conclusion: PathMamba demonstrates that combining Mamba's sequential modeling with Transformer's global reasoning yields topologically superior segmentation maps without the prohibitive scaling costs of pure attention-based models.

Abstract: Achieving both high accuracy and topological continuity in road segmentation from satellite imagery is a critical goal for applications ranging from urban planning to disaster response. State-of-the-art methods often rely on Vision Transformers, which excel at capturing global context, yet their quadratic complexity is a significant barrier to efficient deployment, particularly for on-board processing in resource-constrained platforms. In contrast, emerging State Space Models like Mamba offer linear-time efficiency and are inherently suited to modeling long, continuous structures. We posit that these architectures have complementary strengths. To this end, we introduce PathMamba, a novel hybrid architecture that integrates Mamba's sequential modeling with the Transformer's global reasoning. Our design strategically uses Mamba blocks to trace the continuous nature of road networks, preserving topological structure, while integrating Transformer blocks to refine features with global context. This approach yields topologically superior segmentation maps without the prohibitive scaling costs of pure attention-based models. Our experiments on the DeepGlobe Road Extraction and Massachusetts Roads datasets demonstrate that PathMamba sets a new state-of-the-art. Notably, it significantly improves topological continuity, as measured by the APLS metric, setting a new benchmark while remaining computationally competitive.

TL;DR: CaliTex addresses cross-view inconsistency in 3D texture generation by introducing geometry-calibrated attention modules that explicitly align attention with 3D structure, outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D texture generation systems suffer from cross-view inconsistency due to attention ambiguity, where unstructured full attention causes geometric confusion and unstable appearance-structure coupling.

Method: Introduces CaliTex with two modules: Part-Aligned Attention for spatial alignment across semantically matched parts, and Condition-Routed Attention that routes appearance information through geometry-conditioned pathways. Uses a two-stage diffusion transformer.

Result: CaliTex produces seamless and view-consistent textures and outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines.

Conclusion: CaliTex makes geometric coherence an inherent behavior of the network rather than a byproduct of optimization, effectively solving cross-view inconsistency in 3D texture generation.

Abstract: Despite major advances brought by diffusion-based models, current 3D texture generation systems remain hindered by cross-view inconsistency -- textures that appear convincing from one viewpoint often fail to align across others. We find that this issue arises from attention ambiguity, where unstructured full attention is applied indiscriminately across tokens and modalities, causing geometric confusion and unstable appearance-structure coupling. To address this, we introduce CaliTex, a framework of geometry-calibrated attention that explicitly aligns attention with 3D structure. It introduces two modules: Part-Aligned Attention that enforces spatial alignment across semantically matched parts, and Condition-Routed Attention which routes appearance information through geometry-conditioned pathways to maintain spatial fidelity. Coupled with a two-stage diffusion transformer, CaliTex makes geometric coherence an inherent behavior of the network rather than a byproduct of optimization. Empirically, CaliTex produces seamless and view-consistent textures and outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines.

*Weitian Wang,Lukas Meiner,Rai Shubham,Cecilia De La Parra,Akash Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HTTM is a training-free 3D token merging method that accelerates VGGT by merging tokens at multi-head granularity, preserving feature uniqueness and achieving up to 7x speedup with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VGGT's joint inference of 3D attributes requires global attention layers that cause significant latency bottlenecks for large scenes with long-sequence inputs, limiting practical deployment.

Method: Head-wise temporal merging (HTTM) merges tokens in multi-head granularity rather than uniformly across attention heads, leveraging spatial locality and temporal correspondence at head level to preserve feature uniqueness after head concatenation.

Result: HTTM achieves up to 7x acceleration in GPU-based inference with negligible performance drops, outperforming existing merging techniques that cause identical tokens and hinder representational ability.

Conclusion: HTTM provides an effective training-free solution for accelerating VGGT's 3D scene reconstruction by addressing the token merging problem through multi-head granularity, enabling practical deployment of joint 3D attribute inference.

Abstract: The Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) marks a significant leap forward in 3D scene reconstruction, as it is the first model that directly infers all key 3D attributes (camera poses, depths, and dense geometry) jointly in one pass. However, this joint inference mechanism requires global attention layers that perform all-to-all attention computation on tokens from all views. For reconstruction of large scenes with long-sequence inputs, this causes a significant latency bottleneck. In this paper, we propose head-wise temporal merging (HTTM), a training-free 3D token merging method for accelerating VGGT. Existing merging techniques merge tokens uniformly across different attention heads, resulting in identical tokens in the layers' output, which hinders the model's representational ability. HTTM tackles this problem by merging tokens in multi-head granularity, which preserves the uniqueness of feature tokens after head concatenation. Additionally, this enables HTTM to leverage the spatial locality and temporal correspondence observed at the head level to achieve higher merging ratios with lower merging costs compared to existing methods. Thus, HTTM achieves up to 7x acceleration with negligible performance drops in a GPU-based inference.

TL;DR: ConFu is a contrastive learning framework that jointly embeds individual modalities and their fused combinations into a unified representation space, capturing both pairwise relationships and higher-order dependencies among multiple modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal methods either focus on pairwise alignment between two modalities or capture higher-order interactions but overlook pairwise relationships, limiting their effectiveness on single-modality tasks.

Method: Extends traditional pairwise contrastive objectives with an additional fused-modality contrastive term that aligns modality pairs with a third modality, enabling capture of higher-order dependencies while maintaining pairwise correspondence.

Result: ConFu demonstrates competitive performance on retrieval and classification tasks across synthetic and real-world multimodal benchmarks, supporting unified one-to-one and two-to-one retrieval within a single framework.

Conclusion: The framework successfully captures higher-order dependencies that cannot be recovered through pairwise alignment alone while maintaining strong pairwise correspondence, scaling effectively with increasing multimodal complexity.

Abstract: Learning joint representations across multiple modalities remains a central challenge in multimodal machine learning. Prevailing approaches predominantly operate in pairwise settings, aligning two modalities at a time. While some recent methods aim to capture higher-order interactions among multiple modalities, they often overlook or insufficiently preserve pairwise relationships, limiting their effectiveness on single-modality tasks. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Fusion (ConFu), a framework that jointly embeds both individual modalities and their fused combinations into a unified representation space, where modalities and their fused counterparts are aligned. ConFu extends traditional pairwise contrastive objectives with an additional fused-modality contrastive term, encouraging the joint embedding of modality pairs with a third modality. This formulation enables ConFu to capture higher-order dependencies, such as XOR-like relationships, that cannot be recovered through pairwise alignment alone, while still maintaining strong pairwise correspondence. We evaluate ConFu on synthetic and real-world multimodal benchmarks, assessing its ability to exploit cross-modal complementarity, capture higher-order dependencies, and scale with increasing multimodal complexity. Across these settings, ConFu demonstrates competitive performance on retrieval and classification tasks, while supporting unified one-to-one and two-to-one retrieval within a single contrastive framework.

Motivation: Need for low-latency, low-power real-time detection of structural anomalies in transport infrastructure that preserves spatial feature grounding and supports transparent decision-making.

Method: Hybrid pipeline integrating SIFT for spatial feature encoding, latency-driven spike conversion layer, and LIF Spiking Neural Network for classification, tested on Auckland Harbour Bridge dataset with synthetic augmentation.

Result: 92.3% classification accuracy with 9.5ms per-frame inference time and 8.1% sparse spike activity, enabling real-time edge deployment on consumer-grade hardware.

Conclusion: SIFT-SNN provides efficient, interpretable structural monitoring but requires validation for generalization to unseen field conditions; serves as generalizable case study for movable concrete barrier safety.

Abstract: This paper presents the SIFT-SNN framework, a low-latency neuromorphic signal-processing pipeline for real-time detection of structural anomalies in transport infrastructure. The proposed approach integrates Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for spatial feature encoding with a latency-driven spike conversion layer and a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for classification. The Auckland Harbour Bridge dataset is recorded under various weather and lighting conditions, comprising 6,000 labelled frames that include both real and synthetically augmented unsafe cases. The presented system achieves a classification accuracy of 92.3% (+- 0.8%) with a per-frame inference time of 9.5 ms. Achieved sub-10 millisecond latency, combined with sparse spike activity (8.1%), enables real-time, low-power edge deployment. Unlike conventional CNN-based approaches, the hybrid SIFT-SNN pipeline explicitly preserves spatial feature grounding, enhances interpretability, supports transparent decision-making, and operates efficiently on embedded hardware. Although synthetic augmentation improved robustness, generalisation to unseen field conditions remains to be validated. The SIFT-SNN framework is validated through a working prototype deployed on a consumer-grade system and framed as a generalisable case study in structural safety monitoring for movable concrete barriers, which, as a traffic flow-control infrastructure, is deployed in over 20 cities worldwide.

It integrates pixel-level instrument segmentation masks and structured VQA annotations across laparoscopic, robot-assisted, and micro-surgical domains under a unified taxonomy, enabling comprehensive evaluation beyond traditional VQA tasks and richer visual-conversational interactions. Extensive baseline experiments show that a single model trained on SurgMLLMBench achieves consistent performance across domains and generalizes effectively to unseen datasets. SurgMLLMBench will be publicly released as a robust resource to advance multimodal surgical AI research, supporting reproducible evaluation and development of interactive surgical reasoning models.

TL;DR: A novel multi-scale feature fusion approach for robust normal estimation in point clouds that addresses patch size selection issues through feature aggregation and compensation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with selecting appropriate neighborhood sizes for different data/geometries and have difficulties accurately and efficiently predicting normals for various point clouds.

Method: Proposes Patch Feature Fitting (PFF) using multi-scale feature fusion, with feature aggregation module that progressively aggregates features from different scales while shrinking patch size, and feature compensation module that ensures reusability of features from earlier layers.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets with fewer network parameters and running time.

Conclusion: The multi-scale feature aggregation and compensation strategy enables scale adaptation for varying local patches and delivers optimal feature description for robust normal estimation.

Abstract: Estimating the normal of a point requires constructing a local patch to provide center-surrounding context, but determining the appropriate neighborhood size is difficult when dealing with different data or geometries. Existing methods commonly employ various parameter-heavy strategies to extract a full feature description from the input patch. However, they still have difficulties in accurately and efficiently predicting normals for various point clouds. In this work, we present a new idea of feature extraction for robust normal estimation of point clouds. We use the fusion of multi-scale features from different neighborhood sizes to address the issue of selecting reasonable patch sizes for various data or geometries. We seek to model a patch feature fitting (PFF) based on multi-scale features to approximate the optimal geometric description for normal estimation and implement the approximation process via multi-scale feature aggregation and cross-scale feature compensation. The feature aggregation module progressively aggregates the patch features of different scales to the center of the patch and shrinks the patch size by removing points far from the center. It not only enables the network to precisely capture the structure characteristic in a wide range, but also describes highly detailed geometries. The feature compensation module ensures the reusability of features from earlier layers of large scales and reveals associated information in different patch sizes. Our approximation strategy based on aggregating the features of multiple scales enables the model to achieve scale adaptation of varying local patches and deliver the optimal feature description. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets with fewer network parameters and running time.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Endoscopic videos suffer from strong view-dependent effects like specularities and occlusions, causing photometric supervision to misalign with geometry and trigger early geometric drift that becomes hard to correct during densification.

Method: Three key components: 1) Geo-guided prior distillation using confidence-gated monocular depth with scale-invariant losses, 2) Time-embedded Gaussian field with rotor-like rotation for temporal coherence, 3) Keyframe-constrained streaming with max-points budget for efficiency and stability.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on EndoNeRF and StereoMIS-P1 datasets among monocular reconstruction baselines, demonstrating improved geometric accuracy and temporal consistency.

Conclusion: The proposed Endo-G²T framework successfully anchors geometry early in 4D Gaussian splatting while maintaining temporal consistency and efficiency in dynamic endoscopic scenes.

Abstract: Endoscopic (endo) video exhibits strong view-dependent effects such as specularities, wet reflections, and occlusions. Pure photometric supervision misaligns with geometry and triggers early geometric drift, where erroneous shapes are reinforced during densification and become hard to correct. We ask how to anchor geometry early for 4D Gaussian splatting (4DGS) while maintaining temporal consistency and efficiency in dynamic endoscopic scenes. Thus, we present Endo-G$^{2}$T, a geometry-guided and temporally aware training scheme for time-embedded 4DGS. First, geo-guided prior distillation converts confidence-gated monocular depth into supervision with scale-invariant depth and depth-gradient losses, using a warm-up-to-cap schedule to inject priors softly and avoid early overfitting. Second, a time-embedded Gaussian field represents dynamics in XYZT with a rotor-like rotation parameterization, yielding temporally coherent geometry with lightweight regularization that favors smooth motion and crisp opacity boundaries. Third, keyframe-constrained streaming improves efficiency and long-horizon stability through keyframe-focused optimization under a max-points budget, while non-keyframes advance with lightweight updates. Across EndoNeRF and StereoMIS-P1 datasets, Endo-G$^{2}$T achieves state-of-the-art results among monocular reconstruction baselines.

TL;DR: STVG-o1 enables off-the-shelf multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to achieve state-of-the-art spatio-temporal video grounding performance through bounding-box chain-of-thought reasoning and multi-dimensional reinforcement fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) underperform on spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) due to misaligned training objectives and weak fine-grained region-word alignment in standard visual encoders.

Method: Introduces a bounding-box chain-of-thought mechanism for explicit spatio-temporal reasoning and a multi-dimensional reinforcement reward function with format, consistency, temporal, spatial, and think rewards for geometry-aware supervision.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art results on HCSTVG, outperforming best task-specific method by 7.3% m_tIoU on HCSTVG-v1, matches specialized models on VidSTG, and surpasses all existing MLLM-based approaches by large margins with strong open-vocabulary generalization.

Conclusion: Establishes MLLMs as viable and powerful backbones for precise spatio-temporal video grounding without requiring architectural modifications.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) requires localizing a target object in untrimmed videos both temporally and spatially from natural language descriptions. Despite their strong language understanding, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) underperform on STVG due to misaligned training objectives and weak fine-grained region-word alignment in standard visual encoders. To address this, we propose STVG-o1, the first framework that enables off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve state-of-the-art STVG performance without any architectural modifications. Our method introduces a bounding-box chain-of-thought mechanism that explicitly reasons about spatio-temporal locations in an intermediate step before producing the final prediction. We further design a multi-dimensional reinforcement reward function consisting of format, consistency, temporal, spatial, and think rewards, which provides geometry-aware supervision through reinforcement fine-tuning. Evaluated on HCSTVG-v1/v2 and VidSTG, STVG-o1 sets new state-of-the-art results on HCSTVG, outperforming the best task-specific method by 7.3\% m\_tIoU on HCSTVG-v1, matching specialized models on VidSTG, and surpassing all existing MLLM-based approaches by large margins. It also demonstrates strong open-vocabulary generalization across datasets, establishing MLLMs as viable and powerful backbones for precise spatio-temporal grounding. Our code and models will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Monet is a training framework that enables multimodal LLMs to reason in latent visual space using continuous embeddings as visual thoughts, addressing computational costs and supervision issues through a three-stage SFT pipeline and VLPO reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual reasoning methods lack human-like abstract visual thinking due to limitations of external tools, motivating the need for direct reasoning in latent visual space.

Method: Three-stage distillation-based SFT pipeline with VLPO reinforcement learning, using a 125K CoT dataset (Monet-SFT-125K) for training multimodal LLMs to generate latent visual embeddings.

Result: Monet-7B shows consistent gains across real-world perception and reasoning benchmarks with strong out-of-distribution generalization on abstract visual reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables latent visual reasoning, with empirical analysis providing insights for future developments in this area.

Abstract: "Thinking with images" has emerged as an effective paradigm for advancing visual reasoning, extending beyond text-only chains of thought by injecting visual evidence into intermediate reasoning steps. However, existing methods fall short of human-like abstract visual thinking, as their flexibility is fundamentally limited by external tools. In this work, we introduce Monet, a training framework that enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to reason directly within the latent visual space by generating continuous embeddings that function as intermediate visual thoughts. We identify two core challenges in training MLLMs for latent visual reasoning: high computational cost in latent-vision alignment and insufficient supervision over latent embeddings, and address them with a three-stage distillation-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) pipeline. We further reveal a limitation of applying GRPO to latent reasoning: it primarily enhances text-based reasoning rather than latent reasoning. To overcome this, we propose VLPO (Visual-latent Policy Optimization), a reinforcement learning method that explicitly incorporates latent embeddings into policy gradient updates. To support SFT, we construct Monet-SFT-125K, a high-quality text-image interleaved CoT dataset containing 125K real-world, chart, OCR, and geometry CoTs. Our model, Monet-7B, shows consistent gains across real-world perception and reasoning benchmarks and exhibits strong out-of-distribution generalization on challenging abstract visual reasoning tasks. We also empirically analyze the role of each training component and discuss our early unsuccessful attempts, providing insights for future developments in visual latent reasoning.

### [86] [Do Reasoning Vision-Language Models Inversely Scale in Test-Time Compute? A Distractor-centric Empirical Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21397)
*Jiyun Bae,Hyunjong Ok,Sangwoo Mo,Jaeho Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Visual distractors in vision-language models cause inverse scaling (reduced accuracy) without increasing reasoning length, unlike textual distractors. A new dataset (Idis) and analysis method reveal these effects and propose mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether visual distractors cause inverse scaling effects similar to those observed in language models, and to understand how distractors affect reasoning in multimodal settings.

Method: Created Idis dataset with systematic visual distractors (semantic, numerical, spatial), analyzed reasoning traces by tracking attribute counts, and tested on visual bias benchmarks like Waterbirds.

Result: Visual distractors cause inverse scaling (accuracy decreases) but don't increase reasoning length like textual distractors. Attribute tracking in reasoning traces reveals how distractors affect model performance.

Conclusion: Visual distractors have distinct effects from textual ones, and simple prompting strategies can help mitigate bias-driven predictions in reasoning models.

Abstract: How does irrelevant information (i.e., distractors) affect test-time scaling in vision-language models (VLMs)? Prior studies on language models have reported an inverse scaling effect, where textual distractors lead to longer but less effective reasoning. To investigate whether similar phenomena occur in multimodal settings, we introduce Idis (Images with distractors), a visual question-answering dataset that systematically varies distractors along semantic, numerical, and spatial dimensions. Our analyses reveal that visual distractors differ fundamentally from textual ones: although inverse scaling persists, adding visual distractors reduces accuracy without increasing reasoning length. We further show that tracking attribute counts within reasoning traces provides key insights into how distractors, reasoning length, and accuracy interact. Finally, we demonstrate that these trends extend to established visual bias benchmarks such as Waterbirds, and we propose a simple prompting strategy to mitigate bias-driven predictions in reasoning models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiverseVAR enhances diversity in text-conditioned visual autoregressive models without retraining by combining text-embedding noise injection with scale-travel latent refinement, achieving better diversity-quality trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR models suffer from limited diversity, producing nearly identical images for simple prompts, which has been overlooked amid focus on image quality.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Inject noise into text embeddings to increase diversity, 2) Use scale-travel latent refinement with multi-scale autoencoder to resume generation at intermediate stages and preserve image quality.

Result: Combining text-embedding noise injection with scale-travel refinement significantly enhances diversity while minimizing image-quality degradation, achieving new Pareto frontier in diversity-quality trade-off.

Conclusion: DiverseVAR framework successfully addresses VAR's diversity limitation at test time without retraining or substantial computational overhead.

Abstract: We introduce DiverseVAR, a framework that enhances the diversity of text-conditioned visual autoregressive models (VAR) at test time without requiring retraining, fine-tuning, or substantial computational overhead. While VAR models have recently emerged as strong competitors to diffusion and flow models for image generation, they suffer from a critical limitation in diversity, often producing nearly identical images even for simple prompts. This issue has largely gone unnoticed amid the predominant focus on image quality. We address this limitation at test time in two stages. First, inspired by diversity enhancement techniques in diffusion models, we propose injecting noise into the text embedding. This introduces a trade-off between diversity and image quality: as diversity increases, the image quality sharply declines. To preserve quality, we propose scale-travel: a novel latent refinement technique inspired by time-travel strategies in diffusion models. Specifically, we use a multi-scale autoencoder to extract coarse-scale tokens that enable us to resume generation at intermediate stages. Extensive experiments show that combining text-embedding noise injection with our scale-travel refinement significantly enhances diversity while minimizing image-quality degradation, achieving a new Pareto frontier in the diversity-quality trade-off.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel remote sensing change captioning method that uses the SAM foundation model to extract region-level representations and inject region-of-interest knowledge, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods have weak region awareness and limited temporal alignment in remote sensing change captioning, which aims to describe changes between two images in natural language.

Method: Uses CNN/Transformer for global features, SAM foundation model to delineate semantic- and motion-level change regions, knowledge graph for object information, fuses via cross-attention, and generates descriptions with Transformer decoder.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple widely used benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses region awareness and temporal alignment issues in remote sensing change captioning by leveraging SAM foundation model and knowledge graph integration.

Abstract: Remote sensing change captioning is an emerging and popular research task that aims to describe, in natural language, the content of interest that has changed between two remote sensing images captured at different times. Existing methods typically employ CNNs/Transformers to extract visual representations from the given images or incorporate auxiliary tasks to enhance the final results, with weak region awareness and limited temporal alignment. To address these issues, this paper explores the use of the SAM (Segment Anything Model) foundation model to extract region-level representations and inject region-of-interest knowledge into the captioning framework. Specifically, we employ a CNN/Transformer model to extract global-level vision features, leverage the SAM foundation model to delineate semantic- and motion-level change regions, and utilize a specially constructed knowledge graph to provide information about objects of interest. These heterogeneous sources of information are then fused via cross-attention, and a Transformer decoder is used to generate the final natural language description of the observed changes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple widely used benchmark datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: E-M3RF is an equivariant multimodal 3D reassembly framework that uses both geometric and color features with SE(3) flow matching to improve fragment reassembly, especially when geometry alone is ambiguous.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based 3D reassembly methods rely primarily on geometric features, struggling when geometry is insufficient (e.g., small, eroded, or symmetric fragments) and lacking physical constraints to prevent overlapping assemblies.

Method: Uses SE(3) flow matching with multimodal features: rotation-equivariant encoder for 3D point positions and transformer for color features, combining both to form a unified representation.

Result: On the RePAIR dataset, reduces rotation error by 23.1%, translation error by 13.2%, and Chamfer Distance by 18.4% compared to competing methods across four datasets (synthetic and real-world cultural heritage).

Conclusion: E-M3RF effectively addresses limitations of geometry-only approaches by incorporating multimodal features and physical constraints, demonstrating significant improvements in 3D reassembly accuracy.

Abstract: 3D reassembly is a fundamental geometric problem, and in recent years it has increasingly been challenged by deep learning methods rather than classical optimization. While learning approaches have shown promising results, most still rely primarily on geometric features to assemble a whole from its parts. As a result, methods struggle when geometry alone is insufficient or ambiguous, for example, for small, eroded, or symmetric fragments. Additionally, solutions do not impose physical constraints that explicitly prevent overlapping assemblies. To address these limitations, we introduce E-M3RF, an equivariant multimodal 3D reassembly framework that takes as input the point clouds, containing both point positions and colors of fractured fragments, and predicts the transformations required to reassemble them using SE(3) flow matching. Each fragment is represented by both geometric and color features: i) 3D point positions are encoded as rotationconsistent geometric features using a rotation-equivariant encoder, ii) the colors at each 3D point are encoded with a transformer. The two feature sets are then combined to form a multimodal representation. We experimented on four datasets: two synthetic datasets, Breaking Bad and Fantastic Breaks, and two real-world cultural heritage datasets, RePAIR and Presious, demonstrating that E-M3RF on the RePAIR dataset reduces rotation error by 23.1% and translation error by 13.2%, while Chamfer Distance decreases by 18.4% compared to competing methods.

Abstract: We present a novel unsupervised framework to unlock vast unlabeled human demonstration data from continuous industrial video streams for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model pre-training. Our method first trains a lightweight motion tokenizer to encode motion dynamics, then employs an unsupervised action segmenter leveraging a novel "Latent Action Energy" metric to discover and segment semantically coherent action primitives. The pipeline outputs both segmented video clips and their corresponding latent action sequences, providing structured data directly suitable for VLA pre-training. Evaluations on public benchmarks and a proprietary electric motor assembly dataset demonstrate effective segmentation of key tasks performed by humans at workstations. Further clustering and quantitative assessment via a Vision-Language Model confirm the semantic coherence of the discovered action primitives. To our knowledge, this is the first fully automated end-to-end system for extracting and organizing VLA pre-training data from unstructured industrial videos, offering a scalable solution for embodied AI integration in manufacturing.

TL;DR: Proposes a hypergraph-guided spatio-temporal event stream completion method that addresses spatial sparsity in event cameras by connecting event tokens across time and space, enabling multi-modal fusion with RGB data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras produce spatially sparse but temporally dense data, and existing representation learning methods struggle with undersampling due to spatial sparsity.

Method: Uses hypergraphs to connect event tokens across different times and spatial locations, leverages contextual information message passing for event completion, and incorporates RGB tokens for multi-modal hypergraph-based information completion with self-attention aggregation.

Result: Extensive experiments on single- and multi-label event classification tasks fully validated the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: The hypergraph-guided completion mechanism effectively addresses spatial sparsity in event streams and enables successful multi-modal feature fusion for event classification tasks.

Abstract: Event cameras produce asynchronous event streams that are spatially sparse yet temporally dense. Mainstream event representation learning algorithms typically use event frames, voxels, or tensors as input. Although these approaches have achieved notable progress, they struggle to address the undersampling problem caused by spatial sparsity. In this paper, we propose a novel hypergraph-guided spatio-temporal event stream completion mechanism, which connects event tokens across different times and spatial locations via hypergraphs and leverages contextual information message passing to complete these sparse events. The proposed method can flexibly incorporate RGB tokens as nodes in the hypergraph within this completion framework, enabling multi-modal hypergraph-based information completion. Subsequently, we aggregate hypergraph node information across different time steps through self-attention, enabling effective learning and fusion of multi-modal features. Extensive experiments on both single- and multi-label event classification tasks fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

Result: Achieves 10x generation speed increase, 2x attention operation speed-up, and comparable quality to existing models with 720p video generation under 100ms per frame.

Conclusion: MobileI2V enables fast, high-quality image-to-video synthesis on mobile devices, overcoming previous computational limitations for real-time applications.

Abstract: Recently, video generation has witnessed rapid advancements, drawing increasing attention to image-to-video (I2V) synthesis on mobile devices. However, the substantial computational complexity and slow generation speed of diffusion models pose significant challenges for real-time, high-resolution video generation on resource-constrained mobile devices. In this work, we propose MobileI2V, a 270M lightweight diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation on mobile devices. The core lies in: (1) We analyzed the performance of linear attention modules and softmax attention modules on mobile devices, and proposed a linear hybrid architecture denoiser that balances generation efficiency and quality. (2) We design a time-step distillation strategy that compresses the I2V sampling steps from more than 20 to only two without significant quality loss, resulting in a 10-fold increase in generation speed. (3) We apply mobile-specific attention optimizations that yield a 2-fold speed-up for attention operations during on-device inference. MobileI2V enables, for the first time, fast 720p image-to-video generation on mobile devices, with quality comparable to existing models. Under one-step conditions, the generation speed of each frame of 720p video is less than 100 ms. Our code is available at: https://github.com/hustvl/MobileI2V.

Conclusion: The frequency-aware token reduction strategy effectively addresses computational efficiency issues in Vision Transformers while preserving performance and mitigating frequency-related problems in self-attention.

Abstract: Vision Transformers have demonstrated exceptional performance across various computer vision tasks, yet their quadratic computational complexity concerning token length remains a significant challenge. To address this, token reduction methods have been widely explored. However, existing approaches often overlook the frequency characteristics of self-attention, such as rank collapsing and over-smoothing phenomenon. In this paper, we propose a frequency-aware token reduction strategy that improves computational efficiency while preserving performance by mitigating rank collapsing. Our method partitions tokens into high-frequency tokens and low-frequency tokens. high-frequency tokens are selectively preserved, while low-frequency tokens are aggregated into a compact direct current token to retain essential low-frequency components. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves accuracy while reducing computational overhead and mitigating rank collapsing and over smoothing. Furthermore, we analyze the previous methods, shedding light on their implicit frequency characteristics and limitations.

TL;DR: Merge-and-Bound (M&B) is a novel CIL training approach that manipulates model weights through inter-task and intra-task merging with bounded updates to prevent catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address catastrophic forgetting in Class Incremental Learning by directly optimizing model weights in parameter space while preserving knowledge from previous tasks.

Method: Uses two types of weight merging: inter-task (averaging weights from previous stages) and intra-task (combining parameters within current stage), plus bounded update technique to minimize cumulative updates.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance on standard CIL benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: M&B effectively reduces catastrophic forgetting and can be seamlessly integrated into existing CIL methods without architectural changes.

Abstract: We present a novel training approach, named Merge-and-Bound (M&B) for Class Incremental Learning (CIL), which directly manipulates model weights in the parameter space for optimization. Our algorithm involves two types of weight merging: inter-task weight merging and intra-task weight merging. Inter-task weight merging unifies previous models by averaging the weights of models from all previous stages. On the other hand, intra-task weight merging facilitates the learning of current task by combining the model parameters within current stage. For reliable weight merging, we also propose a bounded update technique that aims to optimize the target model with minimal cumulative updates and preserve knowledge from previous tasks; this strategy reveals that it is possible to effectively obtain new models near old ones, reducing catastrophic forgetting. M&B is seamlessly integrated into existing CIL methods without modifying architecture components or revising learning objectives. We extensively evaluate our algorithm on standard CIL benchmarks and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: Traditional self-attention-based distillation methods align teacher and student features independently, lacking dynamic consideration of pixel-wise relationships across feature maps.

Method: Uses cross-attention mechanisms where each student pixel dynamically considers all teacher pixels, implemented as an additional loss function for non-local knowledge transfer.

Result: Extensive experiments show CanKD outperforms state-of-the-art feature and hybrid distillation methods on object detection and image segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: CanKD demonstrates potential as a new paradigm for attention-guided distillation in computer vision, with superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: We propose Cross-Attention-based Non-local Knowledge Distillation (CanKD), a novel feature-based knowledge distillation framework that leverages cross-attention mechanisms to enhance the knowledge transfer process. Unlike traditional self-attention-based distillation methods that align teacher and student feature maps independently, CanKD enables each pixel in the student feature map to dynamically consider all pixels in the teacher feature map. This non-local knowledge transfer more thoroughly captures pixel-wise relationships, improving feature representation learning. Our method introduces only an additional loss function to achieve superior performance compared with existing attention-guided distillation methods.

Motivation: Deepfake detection performance depends heavily on implementation details rather than core design, making fair comparisons difficult and obscuring true performance factors.

Result: Identified a set of design choices that consistently improve deepfake detection and achieve state-of-the-art performance on the AI-GenBench benchmark.

Conclusion: Established robust, architecture-agnostic best practices for future deepfake detection systems by isolating impactful design factors.

Abstract: The effectiveness of deepfake detection methods often depends less on their core design and more on implementation details such as data preprocessing, augmentation strategies, and optimization techniques. These factors make it difficult to fairly compare detectors and to understand which factors truly contribute to their performance. To address this, we systematically investigate how different design choices influence the accuracy and generalization capabilities of deepfake detection models, focusing on aspects related to training, inference, and incremental updates. By isolating the impact of individual factors, we aim to establish robust, architecture-agnostic best practices for the design and development of future deepfake detection systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual ANA detection is slow, labor-intensive, and requires extensive training, while existing automated methods struggle with the complexities of multi-instance multi-label learning in clinical settings.

Method: Proposed framework handles MIML tasks using unaltered microscope images without preprocessing, identifying consistent ANA sub-regions and assigning aggregated labels through instance sampler, probabilistic pseudo-label dispatcher, and self-paced weight learning rate coefficients.

Result: Achieves up to +7.0% F1-Macro and +12.6% mAP gains over best prior method on ANA dataset, and top-2 performance on public medical MIML benchmarks with up to 18.2% reduction in Hamming loss and 26.9% reduction in one-error.

Conclusion: The framework overcomes limitations of traditional MIML methods, supports end-to-end optimization, and sets new state-of-the-art results for automated ANA detection in clinical settings.

Abstract: Antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing is a crucial method for diagnosing autoimmune disorders, including lupus, Sjögren's syndrome, and scleroderma. Despite its importance, manual ANA detection is slow, labor-intensive, and demands years of training. ANA detection is complicated by over 100 coexisting antibody types, resulting in vast fluorescent pattern combinations. Although machine learning and deep learning have enabled automation, ANA detection in real-world clinical settings presents unique challenges as it involves multi-instance, multi-label (MIML) learning. In this paper, a novel framework for ANA detection is proposed that handles the complexities of MIML tasks using unaltered microscope images without manual preprocessing. Inspired by human labeling logic, it identifies consistent ANA sub-regions and assigns aggregated labels accordingly. These steps are implemented using three task-specific components: an instance sampler, a probabilistic pseudo-label dispatcher, and self-paced weight learning rate coefficients. The instance sampler suppresses low-confidence instances by modeling pattern confidence, while the dispatcher adaptively assigns labels based on instance distinguishability. Self-paced learning adjusts training according to empirical label observations. Our framework overcomes limitations of traditional MIML methods and supports end-to-end optimization. Extensive experiments on one ANA dataset and three public medical MIML benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our framework. On the ANA dataset, our model achieves up to +7.0% F1-Macro and +12.6% mAP gains over the best prior method, setting new state-of-the-art results. It also ranks top-2 across all key metrics on public datasets, reducing Hamming loss and one-error by up to 18.2% and 26.9%, respectively.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have shown great promise in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision, and similar efforts are now emerging in the Earth Observation community. These models aim to generalize across tasks with limited supervision, reducing the need for training separate models for each task. However, current strategies, which largely focus on scaling model size and dataset volume, require prohibitive computational and data resources, limiting accessibility to only a few large institutions. Moreover, this paradigm of ever-larger models stands in stark contrast with the principles of sustainable and environmentally responsible AI, as it leads to immense carbon footprints and resource inefficiency. In this work, we present a novel and efficient alternative: an Ensemble-of-Specialists framework for building Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs). Our method decomposes the training process into lightweight, task-specific ConvNeXtV2 specialists that can be frozen and reused. This modular approach offers strong advantages in efficiency, interpretability, and extensibility. Moreover, it naturally supports federated training, pruning, and continuous specialist integration, making it particularly well-suited for collaborative and resource-constrained settings. Our framework sets a new direction for building scalable and efficient RSFMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Timely identification of Alzheimer's disease is crucial for personalized treatment, but existing methods struggle with irregular time intervals in input sequences and accurate representation of disease characteristics.

Method: Innovative sequential image generation methodology guided by quantitative metrics, integrating age-scaling factors to produce age-specific MRI images for predicting advanced disease stages.

Result: Quantitative metrics significantly improved MRI image synthesis accuracy; age-scaled pixel loss enhanced iterative generation; achieved Structural Similarity Index of 0.882 for long-term disease prognosis.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively maintains essential disease progression features and enables accurate prediction of advanced Alzheimer's disease stages through improved MRI image synthesis.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a debilitating disorder marked by a decline in cognitive function. Timely identification of the disease is essential for the development of personalized treatment strategies that aim to mitigate its progression. The application of generated images for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease poses challenges, particularly in accurately representing the disease's characteristics when input sequences are captured at irregular time intervals. This study presents an innovative methodology for sequential image generation, guided by quantitative metrics, to maintain the essential features indicative of disease progression. Furthermore, an age-scaling factor is integrated into the process to produce age-specific MRI images, facilitating the prediction of advanced stages of the disease. The results obtained from the ablation study suggest that the inclusion of quantitative metrics significantly improves the accuracy of MRI image synthesis. Furthermore, the application of age-scaled pixel loss contributed to the enhanced iterative generation of MRI images. In terms of long-term disease prognosis, the Structural Similarity Index reached a peak value of 0.882, indicating a substantial degree of similarity in the synthesized images.

### [100] [Video Generation Models Are Good Latent Reward Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21541)

TL;DR: PRFL enables efficient preference optimization for video generation by using pre-trained models as reward models in latent space, avoiding expensive VAE decoding and improving alignment while reducing memory/time costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video reward models require pixel-space inputs, forcing ReFL optimization to late denoising steps after VAE decoding, which is computationally expensive and lacks early-stage supervision for motion dynamics.

Method: Propose Process Reward Feedback Learning (PRFL) that conducts preference optimization entirely in latent space using pre-trained video generation models as reward models, enabling full denoising chain gradient backpropagation without VAE decoding.

Result: PRFL significantly improves alignment with human preferences while achieving substantial reductions in memory consumption and training time compared to RGB ReFL.

Conclusion: Pre-trained video generation models are naturally suited for latent-space reward modeling, enabling efficient preference optimization that improves both visual quality and fundamental motion dynamics.

Abstract: Reward feedback learning (ReFL) has proven effective for aligning image generation with human preferences. However, its extension to video generation faces significant challenges. Existing video reward models rely on vision-language models designed for pixel-space inputs, confining ReFL optimization to near-complete denoising steps after computationally expensive VAE decoding. This pixel-space approach incurs substantial memory overhead and increased training time, and its late-stage optimization lacks early-stage supervision, refining only visual quality rather than fundamental motion dynamics and structural coherence. In this work, we show that pre-trained video generation models are naturally suited for reward modeling in the noisy latent space, as they are explicitly designed to process noisy latent representations at arbitrary timesteps and inherently preserve temporal information through their sequential modeling capabilities. Accordingly, we propose Process Reward Feedback Learning~(PRFL), a framework that conducts preference optimization entirely in latent space, enabling efficient gradient backpropagation throughout the full denoising chain without VAE decoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRFL significantly improves alignment with human preferences, while achieving substantial reductions in memory consumption and training time compared to RGB ReFL.

### [101] [UAVLight: A Benchmark for Illumination-Robust 3D Reconstruction in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21565)
*Kang Du,Xue Liao,Junpeng Xia,Chaozheng Guo,Yi Gu,Yirui Guan,Duotun Wang,ShengHuang,Zeyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UAVLight is a new benchmark for illumination-robust 3D reconstruction that captures scenes at multiple fixed times of day along repeatable flight paths to study lighting variation under consistent geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Illumination inconsistency in multi-view 3D reconstruction causes geometry drift, color inconsistency, and shadow imprinting, especially problematic in UAV-based outdoor reconstruction where lighting changes are unavoidable. Existing datasets either lack meaningful illumination diversity or have confounding geometric/semantic changes.

Method: Created a controlled-yet-real benchmark by capturing scenes along repeatable, geo-referenced flight paths at multiple fixed times of day, producing natural lighting variation under consistent geometry, calibration, and viewpoints.

Result: The UAVLight benchmark provides standardized evaluation protocols across lighting conditions for developing and benchmarking reconstruction methods.

Conclusion: UAVLight offers a reliable foundation for developing reconstruction methods that are consistent, faithful, and relightable in real outdoor environments by isolating lighting effects from other variables.

Abstract: Illumination inconsistency is a fundamental challenge in multi-view 3D reconstruction. Variations in sunlight direction, cloud cover, and shadows break the constant-lighting assumption underlying both classical multi-view stereo (MVS) and structure from motion (SfM) pipelines and recent neural rendering methods, leading to geometry drift, color inconsistency, and shadow imprinting. This issue is especially critical in UAV-based reconstruction, where long flight durations and outdoor environments make lighting changes unavoidable. However, existing datasets either restrict capture to short time windows, thus lacking meaningful illumination diversity, or span months and seasons, where geometric and semantic changes confound the isolated study of lighting robustness. We introduce UAVLight, a controlled-yet-real benchmark for illumination-robust 3D reconstruction. Each scene is captured along repeatable, geo-referenced flight paths at multiple fixed times of day, producing natural lighting variation under consistent geometry, calibration, and viewpoints. With standardized evaluation protocols across lighting conditions, UAVLight provides a reliable foundation for developing and benchmarking reconstruction methods that are consistent, faithful, and relightable in real outdoor environments.

TL;DR: Proposes MRPD, an efficient teacher-student framework that uses multimodal knowledge distillation with confidence-gated mechanism to build robust 3D point cloud models against adversarial attacks without inference overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing defense methods: high computational overhead and poor generalization across diverse attack types in 3D point cloud models.

Method: Multimodal teacher-student framework with three teachers (vision model for depth projections, high-performance 3D model, text encoder) and confidence-gated mechanism to balance modality contributions during training.

Result: Substantially outperforms state-of-the-art defenses against white-box and black-box attacks, achieves better performance on clean data, with no inference computational cost.

Conclusion: Presents a practical paradigm for building robust 3D vision systems by efficiently harnessing multimodal knowledge through training-time distillation.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to learning-based 3D point cloud models, critically undermining their reliability in security-sensitive applications. Existing defense methods often suffer from (1) high computational overhead and (2) poor generalization ability across diverse attack types. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel yet efficient teacher-student framework, namely Multimodal Robust Prompt Distillation (MRPD) for distilling robust 3D point cloud model. It learns lightweight prompts by aligning student point cloud model's features with robust embeddings from three distinct teachers: a vision model processing depth projections, a high-performance 3D model, and a text encoder. To ensure a reliable knowledge transfer, this distillation is guided by a confidence-gated mechanism which dynamically balances the contribution of all input modalities. Notably, since the distillation is all during the training stage, there is no additional computational cost at inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRPD substantially outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods against a wide range of white-box and black-box attacks, while even achieving better performance on clean data. Our work presents a new, practical paradigm for building robust 3D vision systems by efficiently harnessing multimodal knowledge.

*Chou Mo,Yehyun Suh,J. Ryan Martin,Daniel Moyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework combining 2D/3D landmark registration with U-Net training improves pelvic landmark detection accuracy under variable patient pose conditions in fluoroscopy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pelvic landmark detection methods assume fixed Antero-Posterior view, but real intra-operative imaging often has variable orientation due to patient repositioning or imaging unit movement.

Method: Proposed framework incorporates 2D/3D landmark registration into U-Net training, using Pose Estimation Loss and fine-tuning strategies to handle variable patient poses.

Result: Compared baseline U-Net, U-Net with Pose Estimation Loss, and fine-tuned U-Net under realistic variable pose conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework addresses the limitation of fixed-view assumptions in pelvic landmark detection, improving performance in realistic intra-operative scenarios with variable patient positioning.

Abstract: Automated landmark detection offers an efficient approach for medical professionals to understand patient anatomic structure and positioning using intra-operative imaging. While current detection methods for pelvic fluoroscopy demonstrate promising accuracy, most assume a fixed Antero-Posterior view of the pelvis. However, orientation often deviates from this standard view, either due to repositioning of the imaging unit or of the target structure itself. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that incorporates 2D/3D landmark registration into the training of a U-Net landmark prediction model. We analyze the performance difference by comparing landmark detection accuracy between the baseline U-Net, U-Net trained with Pose Estimation Loss, and U-Net fine-tuned with Pose Estimation Loss under realistic intra-operative conditions where patient pose is variable.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Harmony is a novel framework that addresses audio-visual synchronization challenges in generative AI through cross-task synergy training, global-local decoupled interaction, and synchronization-enhanced CFG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-source models struggle with robust audio-video alignment due to three fundamental challenges in joint diffusion: correspondence drift, inefficient global attention, and intra-modal bias in CFG.

Method: Proposes Cross-Task Synergy training to mitigate drift, Global-Local Decoupled Interaction Module for temporal-style alignment, and Synchronization-Enhanced CFG (SyncCFG) to amplify alignment signals.

Result: Extensive experiments show Harmony establishes new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in generation fidelity and fine-grained audio-visual synchronization.

Conclusion: Harmony successfully overcomes fundamental synchronization challenges in audio-visual content generation through its novel framework design.

Abstract: The synthesis of synchronized audio-visual content is a key challenge in generative AI, with open-source models facing challenges in robust audio-video alignment. Our analysis reveals that this issue is rooted in three fundamental challenges of the joint diffusion process: (1) Correspondence Drift, where concurrently evolving noisy latents impede stable learning of alignment; (2) inefficient global attention mechanisms that fail to capture fine-grained temporal cues; and (3) the intra-modal bias of conventional Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which enhances conditionality but not cross-modal synchronization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Harmony, a novel framework that mechanistically enforces audio-visual synchronization. We first propose a Cross-Task Synergy training paradigm to mitigate drift by leveraging strong supervisory signals from audio-driven video and video-driven audio generation tasks. Then, we design a Global-Local Decoupled Interaction Module for efficient and precise temporal-style alignment. Finally, we present a novel Synchronization-Enhanced CFG (SyncCFG) that explicitly isolates and amplifies the alignment signal during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Harmony establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in both generation fidelity and, critically, in achieving fine-grained audio-visual synchronization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Oral cancer is often diagnosed late due to visual similarity between benign, precancerous, and malignant lesions, highlighting the need for early computer-aided diagnosis systems.

Result: Achieved 83.33% accuracy, 89.12% precision, and 77.31% recall, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with notable minority class performance.

Conclusion: The framework shows promise as a first step toward trustworthy computer-aided diagnostic systems for early oral cancer detection in clinical settings.

Abstract: Oral cancer is highly common across the globe and is mostly diagnosed during the later stages due to the close visual similarity to benign, precancerous, and malignant lesions in the oral cavity. Implementing computer aided diagnosis systems early on has the potential to greatly improve clinical outcomes. This research intends to use deep learning to build a multiclass classifier for sixteen different oral lesions. To overcome the challenges of limited and imbalanced datasets, the proposed technique combines stratified data splitting and advanced data augmentation and oversampling to perform the classification. The experimental results, which achieved 83.33 percent accuracy, 89.12 percent precision, and 77.31 percent recall, demonstrate the superiority of the suggested model over state of the art methods now in use. The suggested model effectively conveys the effectiveness of oversampling and augmentation strategies in situations where the minority class classification performance is noteworthy. As a first step toward trustworthy computer aided diagnostic systems for the early detection of oral cancer in clinical settings, the suggested framework shows promise.

Conclusion: WiRainbow provides a practical solution for single-antenna-based direction awareness in Wi-Fi sensing, addressing deployment complexity and cost issues while maintaining performance in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Recently, Wi-Fi signals have emerged as a powerful tool for contactless sensing. During the sensing process, obtaining target direction information can provide valuable contextual insights for various applications. Existing direction estimation methods typically rely on antenna arrays, which are costly and complex to deploy in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present WiRainbow, a novel approach that enables single-antenna-based direction awareness for Wi-Fi sensing by leveraging the dispersion effect of frequency-scanning antennas (FSAs), which can naturally steer Wi-Fi subcarriers toward distinct angles during signal transmission. To address key challenges in antenna design and signal processing, we propose a coupled-resonator-based antenna architecture that significantly expands the narrow Field-of-View inherent in conventional FSAs, improving sensing coverage. Additionally, we develop a sensing signal-to-noise-ratio-based signal processing framework that reliably estimates target direction in multipath-rich environments. We prototype WiRainbow and evaluate its performance through benchmark experiments and real-world case studies, demonstrating its ability to achieve accurate, robust, and cost-effective direction awareness for diverse Wi-Fi sensing applications.

Motivation: To develop a more accurate fault diagnosis framework that captures cross-channel dependencies in multichannel machine vibration data, overcoming limitations of conventional MFDFA approaches.

Method: Proposed FM-MFDFA using covariance-weighted L_pq matrix norm based on Mahalanobis distance, integrated with multivariate variational mode decomposition (MVMD) for preprocessing.

Result: The method effectively distinguishes between healthy and faulty machine states in wind turbine gearbox data, outperforming conventional MFDFA even under noisy conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed FM-MFDFA framework provides superior fault diagnosis capability by accurately characterizing multiscale structure and cross-channel dependencies in multivariate vibration signals.

Abstract: We propose a fully multivariate generalization of multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA) and leverage it to develop a fault diagnosis framework for multichannel machine vibration data. We introduce a novel covariance-weighted $L_{pq}$ matrix norm based on Mahalanobis distance to define a fully multivariate fluctuation function that uniquely captures cross-channel dependencies and variance biases in multichannel vibration data. This formulation, termed FM-MFDFA, allows for a more accurate characterization of the multiscale structure of multivariate signals. To enhance feature relevance, the proposed framework integrates multivariate variational mode decomposition (MVMD) to isolate fault-relevant components before applying FM-MFDFA. Results on wind turbine gearbox data demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional MFDFA approaches by effectively distinguishing between healthy and faulty machine states, even under noisy conditions.

Main category: eess.SP

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DAB-like systems use DE-PSK but face challenges with accurate channel estimation without pilots in turbo-DE-PSK receivers, which is crucial for performance gains.

Method: Joint estimation of channel phase, gain, and noise variance using 2D trellis decomposition for blind phase estimation and power-based estimators for gain and noise variance.

Result: The blind 2D turbo demodulator approaches performance of receivers with perfect channel knowledge and remains robust under realistic transmission conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed fully blind scheme effectively addresses channel estimation challenges in DAB-like systems without requiring pilots.

Abstract: Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB)-like systems employ differentially encoded (DE) phase-shift keying (PSK) for transmission. While turbo-DE-PSK receivers offer substantial performance gains through iterative decoding by making the DE-PSK an inner code, they rely on accurate channel estimation without pilots, which is a key challenge in DAB-like scenarios. This paper develops a fully blind turbo-DE-PSK scheme that jointly estimates channel phase, channel gain, and noise variance directly from the received signal. The design leverages a two-dimensional (2D) trellis decomposition for blind phase estimation, complemented by power-based estimators for channel gain and noise variance. We provide a comprehensive system assessment across practical system parameters, including inner code length, phase quantization, and 2D block size. Simulation results show that the blind 2D turbo demodulator approaches the performance of receivers with perfect channel knowledge and remains robust under realistic transmission conditions.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A passive, low-cost water-level monitoring method using LTE downlink power metrics (RSRP, RSSI, RSRQ) that applies continuous wavelet transform to extract tide patterns and uses neural networks for water-level tracking, achieving centimeter-level accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current water-level sensing methods rely on expensive fixed instruments vulnerable during extreme events, creating need for low-cost, resilient monitoring solutions.

Method: Extracts LTE power metrics, applies continuous wavelet transform to isolate tide components, uses wavelet features to train lightweight neural network, and implements multi-base-station fusion for improved robustness.

Result: Achieved 0.8 cm RMSE and 0.5 cm MAE in line-of-sight conditions, and 1.7 cm RMSE and 0.8 cm MAE in non-line-of-sight conditions after fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The method provides practical, low-cost water-level monitoring using commodity hardware without array calibration, with multi-base-station fusion enhancing resilience.

Abstract: Real-time water-level monitoring across many locations is vital for flood response, infrastructure management, and environmental forecasting. Yet many sensing methods rely on fixed instruments - acoustic, radar, camera, or pressure probes - that are costly to install and maintain and are vulnerable during extreme events. We propose a passive, low-cost water-level tracking scheme that uses only LTE downlink power metrics reported by commodity receivers. The method extracts per-antenna RSRP, RSSI, and RSRQ, applies a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to the RSRP to isolate the semidiurnal tide component, and forms a summed-coefficient signature that simultaneously marks high/low tide (tide-turn times) and tracks the tide-rate (flow speed) over time. These wavelet features guide a lightweight neural network that learns water-level changes over time from a short training segment. Beyond a single serving base station, we also show a multi-base-station cooperative mode: independent CWTs are computed per carrier and fused by a robust median to produce one tide-band feature that improves stability and resilience to local disturbances. Experiments over a 420 m river path under line-of-sight conditions achieve root-mean-square and mean-absolute errors of 0.8 cm and 0.5 cm, respectively. Under a non-line-of-sight setting with vegetation and vessel traffic, the same model transfers successfully after brief fine-tuning, reaching 1.7 cm RMSE and 0.8 cm MAE. Unlike CSI-based methods, the approach needs no array calibration and runs on standard hardware, making wide deployment practical. When signals from multiple base stations are available, fusion further improves robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subsurface defects like delamination and voids are critical for bridge durability but difficult to detect reliably with traditional visual inspection or manual sounding methods.

Method: Transform raw IE signals via FFT into peak-frequency features, create spatial maps, use k-means clustering for defect localization, and employ stacked LSTM networks for multi-class classification of four defect types.

Result: Achieved 73% overall accuracy in classifying shallow delamination, deep delamination, voids, and honeycombing, with field validation showing generalization to real bridge conditions.

Conclusion: The framework enhances objectivity, scalability, and repeatability of Non-Destructive Evaluation, supporting intelligent bridge health monitoring at network scale.

Abstract: Subsurface defects such as delamination, voids, and honeycombing critically affect the durability of concrete bridge decks but are difficult to detect reliably using visual inspection or manual sounding. This paper presents a machine learning based Impact Echo (IE) framework that automates both defect localization and multi-class classification of common concrete defects. Raw IE signals from Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) laboratory slabs and in-service bridge decks are transformed via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) into dominant peak-frequency features and interpolated into spatial maps for defect zone visualization. Unsupervised k-means clustering highlights low-frequency, defect-prone regions, while Ground Truth Masks (GTMs) derived from seeded lab defects are used to validate spatial accuracy and generate high-confidence training labels. From these validated regions, spatially ordered peak-frequency sequences are constructed and fed into a stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network that classifies four defect types shallow delamination, deep delamination, voids, and honeycombing with 73% overall accuracy. Field validation on the bridge deck demonstrates that models trained on laboratory data generalize under realistic coupling, noise, and environmental variability. The proposed framework enhances the objectivity, scalability, and repeatability of Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE), supporting intelligent, data-driven bridge health monitoring at a network scale.

TL;DR: A sparse array design method using re-weighted L1 SOCP optimization achieves high contrast ultrasound imaging with reduced channel count (252 elements) while maintaining good resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the high cost of thousands of independent channels required for fully-controlled 2D ultrasound arrays while maintaining stable optimization results, as stochastic methods often produce unstable outcomes.

Method: Formulated sparse array synthesis as second-order cone programming (SOCP) with re-weighted L1 technique for sequential optimization, designing a Q-Flats 2D sparse array with side-lobe level ≤ -21.26 dB and 252 activated elements.

Result: The Q-Flats array showed better resolution (about 3%) than Spiral array but slightly worse contrast, while achieving better performance than Spiral-Taper and approaching dense array performance with significantly fewer channels.

Conclusion: The re-weighted L1 SOCP method is a promising and flexible approach for balancing resolution, contrast, and number of activated elements in ultrasound imaging systems.

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) fully-addressed arrays can conveniently realize three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound imaging while fully controlled such arrays usually demands thousands of independent channels, which is costly. Sparse array technique using stochastic optimization methods is one of promising techniques to reduce channel counts while due to the stochastic nature of these methods, the optimized results are usually unstable. In this work, we introduce a sparse array design approach that formulates the synthesis problem of sparse arrays as second-order cone programming (SOCP) and a re-weighted L1 technique is implemented to sequentially optimize the SOCP. Based on this method, an on-grid quasi-flatten side-lobe (Q-Flats) 2D sparse array with side-lobe level (SLL) no more than -21.26 dB and 252 activated elements is designed, which aims to achieve as high contrast performance as possible under the limits of resolution and maximum number of independent channels (i.e., 256). The imaging performance of the Q-Flats array was compared with those of a corresponding dense array (Dense), a Fermat spiral array (Spiral) and a spatially 50%-Tukey tapered spiral array (Spiral-Taper) using Field II simulations in a multi-angle steered diverging wave transmission scheme. It was demonstrated that the Dense achieved the best resolution and contrast and the Spiral-Taper the worst. The Q-Flats showed better resolution (about 3%) but slightly worse contrast than the Spiral. All the results indicate the re-weighted L1 SOCP method is a promising and flexible method for seeking trade-offs among resolution, contrast, and number of activated elements.

Result: Achieves high prediction accuracy with 600-2000x speed improvement compared to CST simulations, requires only about 1% of full-wave simulations needed by AI-assisted EM simulators, and eliminates data-driven overfitting.

Conclusion: MAPES provides an efficient, scalable, and reliable tool for AI-assisted microwave circuit and RFIC design across diverse fabrication technologies, offering practical analytical evaluation of arbitrary pixel configurations without additional full-wave calculations.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel analytical framework, termed the Multiport Analytical Pixel Electromagnetic Simulator (MAPES). MAPES enables efficient and accurate prediction of the electromagnetic (EM) performance of arbitrary pixel-based microwave (MW) and RFIC structures. Inspired by the Integrated Internal Multiport Method (IMPM), MAPES extends the concept to the pixel presence/absence domain used in AI-assisted EM design. By introducing virtual pixels and diagonal virtual pixels and inserting virtual ports at critical positions, MAPES captures all horizontal, vertical, and diagonal electromagnetic couplings within a single multiport impedance matrix. Only a small set of full-wave simulations (typically about 1% of the datasets required by AI-assisted EM simulators) is needed to construct this matrix. Subsequently, any arbitrary pixel configuration can be evaluated analytically using a closed-form multiport relation without additional full-wave calculations. The proposed approach eliminates data-driven overfitting and ensures accurate results across all design variations. Comprehensive examples for single- and double-layer CMOS processes (180 nm and 65 nm) and PCBs confirm that MAPES achieves high prediction accuracy with 600- 2000x speed improvement compared to CST simulations. Owing to its efficiency, scalability and reliability, MAPES provides a practical and versatile tool for AI-assisted MW circuit and RFIC design across diverse fabrication technologies.

*Chin-Hung Chen,Ivana Nikoloska,Wim van Houtum,Yan Wu,Alex Alvarado*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A blind phase-aware EM algorithm for OFDM systems with PSK modulation that resolves phase ambiguity using decoder extrinsic information, reducing local convergence from 80% to nearly 0% with negligible complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the local maximum problem in blind EM channel estimation caused by unknown phase ambiguity, which conventional blind EM estimators cannot resolve.

Method: Generate candidate models based on PSK modulation symmetries and use decoder extrinsic information to select the most likely model. The algorithm is invoked only once after EM initialization.

Result: Simulations show reliable phase ambiguity resolution during initialization, reducing local convergence rate from 80% to nearly 0% in frequency-selective channels with constant phase ambiguity.

Conclusion: The phase-aware EM algorithm effectively resolves phase ambiguity with minimal additional complexity, making it suitable for practical OFDM systems with PSK modulation.

Abstract: This paper presents a fully blind phase-aware expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for OFDM systems with the phase-shift keying (PSK) modulation. We address the well-known local maximum problem of the EM algorithm for blind channel estimation. This is primarily caused by the unknown phase ambiguity in the channel estimates, which conventional blind EM estimators cannot resolve. To overcome this limitation, we propose to exploit the extrinsic information from the decoder as model evidence metrics. A finite set of candidate models is generated based on the inherent symmetries of PSK modulation, and the decoder selects the most likely candidate model. Simulation results demonstrate that, when combined with a simple convolutional code, the phase-aware EM algorithm reliably resolves phase ambiguity during the initialization stage and reduces the local convergence rate from 80% to nearly 0% in frequency-selective channels with a constant phase ambiguity. The algorithm is invoked only once after the EM initialization stage, resulting in negligible additional complexity during subsequent turbo iterations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve semantic communication efficiency in multi-user downlink scenarios by leveraging both shared and user-dependent semantic information through intelligent grouping and transmission strategies.

Method: Balanced clustering of users by semantic similarity, extraction of group-level common features and user-specific private features, multicast transmission of common features and unicast of private features, composite loss function with reconstruction and repulsion losses.

Result: Achieves up to 3.26% performance improvement over conventional schemes across various channel conditions, demonstrating robustness and semantic efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances semantic separability and reconstruction fidelity, making it suitable for next-generation wireless networks.

Abstract: In this letter, we propose a group-wise semantic splitting multiple access framework for multi-user semantic communication in downlink scenarios. The framework begins by applying a balanced clustering mechanism that groups users based on the similarity of their semantic characteristics, enabling the extraction of group-level common features and user-specific private features. The base station then transmits the common features via multicast and the private features via unicast, effectively leveraging both shared and user-dependent semantic information. To further enhance semantic separability and reconstruction fidelity, we design a composite loss function that integrates a reconstruction loss with a repulsion loss, improving both the accuracy of semantic recovery and the distinctiveness of common embeddings in the latent space. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves up to 3.26% performance improvement over conventional schemes across various channel conditions, validating its robustness and semantic efficiency for next-generation wireless networks.

Conclusion: The proposed system provides a viable solution for reliable wireless communication in connectivity-challenged environments using LoRa technology's long-range and low-power capabilities.

Abstract: This work describes the design and implementation of a low-power wireless communication system for transmitting text using ESP32 modules and the LoRa DXLR01. The proposal arises as a solution to connectivity and energy-efficiency problems commonly found in rural areas and certain urban environments where Wi-Fi or mobile networks are unavailable or operate with limitations. To address this, LoRa technology known for its long-range capability and low power consumption is integrated with an ESP32 responsible for capturing, processing, and sending messages.
  The LoRa DXLR01 module, which operates in the 433 MHz band, is configured with parameters aimed at maximising both transmission range and efficient energy usage. Messages are sent using Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) modulation, improving signal penetration in obstructed areas and reducing the likelihood of errors. On the receiving end, the ESP32 interprets the data and displays it on an LCD screen. Additionally, the received information is sent to the ThingSpeak platform, allowing remote storage and visualisation without relying on conventional network infrastructure.
  Tests conducted in a controlled environment show an average latency of 3.2 seconds for text transmission. It was also verified that the system can be used in applications such as remote monitoring, infrastructure management, and access control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of fluorescence interference and noise in Raman spectrum analysis that obscures critical spectral features needed for accurate analysis.

Method: Minimizes a functional with fractional derivatives, reformulated in frequency domain via Fourier transform. Uses Shannon entropy to optimize regularization parameter and derivative order.

Result: Produces an efficient, robust, and easily implementable filter that effectively removes noise while preserving essential spectral features like peak position, intensity, and area.

Conclusion: The combination of variational approach in frequency domain, fractional derivatives, and Shannon entropy optimization creates an effective denoising method for Raman spectra and image processing.

Abstract: The interference of fluorescence signals and noise remains a significant challenge in Raman spectrum analysis, often obscuring subtle spectral features that are critical for accurate analysis. Inspired by variational methods similar to those used in image denoising, our approach minimizes a functional involving fractional derivatives to balance noise suppression with the preservation of essential chemical features of the signal, such as peak position, intensity, and area. The original problem is reformulated in the frequency domain through the Fourier transform, making the implementation simple and fast. In this work, we discuss the theoretical framework, practical implementation, and the advantages and limitations of this method in the context of {simulated} Raman data, as well as in image processing. The main contribution of this article is the combination of a variational approach in the frequency domain, the use of fractional derivatives, and the optimization of the {regularization parameter and} derivative order through the concept of Shannon entropy. This work explores how the fractional order, combined with the regularization parameter, affects noise removal and preserves the essential features of the spectrum {and image}. Finally, the study shows that the combination of the proposed strategies produces an efficient, robust, and easily implementable filter.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: No prior work has achieved liver tumor segmentation, dynamic enhancement regression, and classification simultaneously in an end-to-end framework due to lack of effective inter-task relevance capture and dynamic MRI information extraction mechanisms.

Method: Proposes MTI-Net with Multi-domain Information Entropy Fusion (MdIEF) for frequency/spectral domain integration, task interaction module for higher-order consistency, task-driven discriminator (TDD) for internal task relationships, and shallow Transformer for dynamic MRI sequence encoding.

Result: MTI-Net demonstrates high performance across multiple tasks on a dataset of 238 subjects, showing strong potential for clinical liver tumor assessment.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the challenges of simultaneous multi-task learning for liver tumor analysis and provides a promising tool for clinical applications.

Abstract: Liver tumor segmentation, dynamic enhancement regression, and classification are critical for clinical assessment and diagnosis. However, no prior work has attempted to achieve these tasks simultaneously in an end-to-end framework, primarily due to the lack of an effective framework that captures inter-task relevance for mutual improvement and the absence of a mechanism to extract dynamic MRI information effectively. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-Task Interaction adversarial learning Network (MTI-Net), a novel integrated framework designed to tackle these tasks simultaneously. MTI-Net incorporates Multi-domain Information Entropy Fusion (MdIEF), which utilizes entropy-aware, high-frequency spectral information to effectively integrate features from both frequency and spectral domains, enhancing the extraction and utilization of dynamic MRI data. The network also introduces a task interaction module that establishes higher-order consistency between segmentation and regression, thus fostering inter-task synergy and improving overall performance. Additionally, we designed a novel task-driven discriminator (TDD) to capture internal high-order relationships between tasks. For dynamic MRI information extraction, we employ a shallow Transformer network to perform positional encoding, which captures the relationships within dynamic MRI sequences. In experiments on a dataset of 238 subjects, MTI-Net demonstrates high performance across multiple tasks, indicating its strong potential for assisting in the clinical assessment of liver tumors.

### [119] [Deep Parameter Interpolation for Scalar Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21028)
*Chicago Y. Park,Michael T. McCann,Cristina Garcia-Cardona,Brendt Wohlberg,Ulugbek S. Kamilov*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Deep Parameter Interpolation (DPI) enables neural networks to accept scalar inputs by dynamically interpolating between two parameter sets based on the scalar value, improving performance in diffusion and flow matching models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for incorporating scalar inputs in deep generative models either encode scalars as additional image inputs or restrict architecture choices by combining scalar and vector information in specific components, limiting flexibility.

Method: DPI maintains two learnable parameter sets within a single network and introduces scalar dependency by dynamically interpolating between these parameter sets during training and sampling, making it architecture-agnostic.

Result: DPI improves denoising performance and sample quality for both diffusion and flow matching models while maintaining computational efficiency comparable to standard scalar conditioning techniques.

Conclusion: DPI provides a simple, general-purpose method for adding scalar dependence to neural networks that enhances model performance without restricting architecture choices.

Abstract: We propose deep parameter interpolation (DPI), a general-purpose method for transforming an existing deep neural network architecture into one that accepts an additional scalar input. Recent deep generative models, including diffusion models and flow matching, employ a single neural network to learn a time- or noise level-dependent vector field. Designing a network architecture to accurately represent this vector field is challenging because the network must integrate information from two different sources: a high-dimensional vector (usually an image) and a scalar. Common approaches either encode the scalar as an additional image input or combine scalar and vector information in specific network components, which restricts architecture choices. Instead, we propose to maintain two learnable parameter sets within a single network and to introduce the scalar dependency by dynamically interpolating between the parameter sets based on the scalar value during training and sampling. DPI is a simple, architecture-agnostic method for adding scalar dependence to a neural network. We demonstrate that our method improves denoising performance and enhances sample quality for both diffusion and flow matching models, while achieving computational efficiency comparable to standard scalar conditioning techniques.

*Wouter Visser,Jelmer M. Wolterink*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Neural fields suffer from catastrophic forgetting when extended with new data. This paper analyzes this issue and proposes knowledge distillation to mitigate forgetting when incrementally expanding neural fields in cardiac MRI applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural fields are useful for biomedical imaging but cannot be easily extended without catastrophic forgetting, unlike discrete representations like voxel grids. This limits their practical application when data becomes available incrementally.

Method: The study examines catastrophic forgetting in neural fields using cardiac cine MRI data. It proposes knowledge distillation as a strategy to mitigate forgetting when the spatiotemporal domain is enlarged or signal dimensionality increases, with data available incrementally.

Result: Experiments show that the amount of catastrophic forgetting depends significantly on the neural field model used. Knowledge distillation effectively mitigates forgetting and enables continual learning in neural fields.

Conclusion: Knowledge distillation is a viable strategy to address catastrophic forgetting in neural fields, making continual learning possible when extending neural representations with new incremental data.

Abstract: Neural fields are increasingly used as a light-weight, continuous, and differentiable signal representation in (bio)medical imaging. However, unlike discrete signal representations such as voxel grids, neural fields cannot be easily extended. As neural fields are, in essence, neural networks, prior signals represented in a neural field will degrade when the model is presented with new data due to catastrophic forgetting. This work examines the extent to which different neural field approaches suffer from catastrophic forgetting and proposes a strategy to mitigate this issue. We consider the scenario in which data becomes available incrementally, with only the most recent data available for neural field fitting. In a series of experiments on cardiac cine MRI data, we demonstrate how knowledge distillation mitigates catastrophic forgetting when the spatiotemporal domain is enlarged or the dimensionality of the represented signal is increased. We find that the amount of catastrophic forgetting depends, to a large extent, on the neural fields model used, and that distillation could enable continual learning in neural fields.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable accurate structure-function analysis in neuroscience by overcoming challenges in registering in-vivo and ex-vivo neuronal images, including significant cross-modality appearance gaps, limited annotated data, and severe tissue deformations.

Method: Uses a semantic-enhanced hybrid feature descriptor combining local geometric features with DINOV3 vision foundation model, a learnable Geometric Consistency Confidence Module instead of RANSAC, and a two-stage training strategy with synthetic data pre-training and real data fine-tuning.

Result: Provides a robust and accurate solution for high-precision registration in challenging biomedical imaging scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework enables large-scale correlative studies by successfully addressing the key challenges in cross-modality neuronal image registration.

Abstract: Accurately registering in-vivo two-photon and ex-vivo fluorescence micro-optical sectioning tomography images of individual neurons is critical for structure-function analysis in neuroscience. This task is profoundly challenging due to a significant cross-modality appearance gap, the scarcity of annotated data and severe tissue deformations. We propose a novel deep learning framework to address these issues. Our method introduces a semantic-enhanced hybrid feature descriptor, which fuses the geometric precision of local features with the contextual robustness of a vision foundation model DINOV3 to bridge the modality gap. To handle complex deformations, we replace traditional RANSAC with a learnable Geometric Consistency Confidence Module, a novel classifier trained to identify and reject physically implausible correspondences. A data-efficient two-stage training strategy, involving pre-training on synthetically deformed data and fine-tuning on limited real data, overcomes the data scarcity problem. Our framework provides a robust and accurate solution for high-precision registration in challenging biomedical imaging scenarios, enabling large-scale correlative studies.

*Melika Ayoughi,Pascal Mettes,Paul Groth*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can automatically restructure hierarchies to improve hyperbolic embedding quality by increasing branching factor and enforcing single inheritance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperbolic embeddings perform best with high branching factor and single inheritance, but real-world hierarchies often lack these properties. This paper explores whether LLMs can automatically restructure hierarchies to meet these criteria.

Method: Proposed a prompt-based approach using LLMs to transform existing hierarchies, guided by known desiderata for hyperbolic embeddings (high branching factor, single inheritance).

Result: Experiments on 16 diverse hierarchies show LLM-restructured hierarchies consistently yield higher-quality hyperbolic embeddings across several standard embedding quality metrics.

Conclusion: LLM-guided hierarchy restructuring enables both improved hyperbolic embedding quality and explainable reorganizations with justifications for knowledge engineers.

Abstract: Hyperbolic geometry is an effective geometry for embedding hierarchical data structures. Hyperbolic learning has therefore become increasingly prominent in machine learning applications where data is hierarchically organized or governed by hierarchical semantics, ranging from recommendation systems to computer vision. The quality of hyperbolic embeddings is tightly coupled to the structure of the input hierarchy, which is often derived from knowledge graphs or ontologies. Recent work has uncovered that for an optimal hyperbolic embedding, a high branching factor and single inheritance are key, while embedding algorithms are robust to imbalance and hierarchy size. To assist knowledge engineers in reorganizing hierarchical knowledge, this paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) have the ability to automatically restructure hierarchies to meet these criteria. We propose a prompt-based approach to transform existing hierarchies using LLMs, guided by known desiderata for hyperbolic embeddings. Experiments on 16 diverse hierarchies show that LLM-restructured hierarchies consistently yield higher-quality hyperbolic embeddings across several standard embedding quality metrics. Moreover, we show how LLM-guided hierarchy restructuring enables explainable reorganizations, providing justifications to knowledge engineers.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative AI necessitates robust safety evaluations. However, current safety datasets are predominantly English-centric, failing to capture specific risks in non-English, socio-cultural contexts such as Korean, and are often limited to the text modality. To address this gap, we introduce AssurAI, a new quality-controlled Korean multimodal dataset for evaluating the safety of generative AI. First, we define a taxonomy of 35 distinct AI risk factors, adapted from established frameworks by a multidisciplinary expert group to cover both universal harms and relevance to the Korean socio-cultural context. Second, leveraging this taxonomy, we construct and release AssurAI, a large-scale Korean multimodal dataset comprising 11,480 instances across text, image, video, and audio. Third, we apply the rigorous quality control process used to ensure data integrity, featuring a two-phase construction (i.e., expert-led seeding and crowdsourced scaling), triple independent annotation, and an iterative expert red-teaming loop. Our pilot study validates AssurAI's effectiveness in assessing the safety of recent LLMs. We release AssurAI to the public to facilitate the development of safer and more reliable generative AI systems for the Korean community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MAPC protocols use static, predefined rules that cannot adapt to dynamic network conditions like varying interference levels and topologies, limiting their effectiveness in dense Wi-Fi environments.

Method: Models each access point as an autonomous large language model agent that engages in natural language dialogue, using integrated memory, reflection, and tool use to collaboratively reason about network states and negotiate adaptive coordination strategies.

Result: Comprehensive simulations show the agentic framework successfully adapts to diverse and dynamic network environments, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art spatial reuse baselines.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates potential as a robust and intelligent solution for future wireless networks by enabling dynamic, adaptive coordination through AI agents.

Abstract: Multi-access point coordination (MAPC) is a key technology for enhancing throughput in next-generation Wi-Fi within dense overlapping basic service sets. However, existing MAPC protocols rely on static, protocol-defined rules, which limits their ability to adapt to dynamic network conditions such as varying interference levels and topologies. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Agentic AI Wi-Fi framework where each access point, modeled as an autonomous large language model agent, collaboratively reasons about the network state and negotiates adaptive coordination strategies in real time. This dynamic collaboration is achieved through a cognitive workflow that enables the agents to engage in natural language dialogue, leveraging integrated memory, reflection, and tool use to ground their decisions in past experience and environmental feedback. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that our agentic framework successfully learns to adapt to diverse and dynamic network environments, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art spatial reuse baseline and validating its potential as a robust and intelligent solution for future wireless networks.

Conclusion: A²Flow successfully automates agentic workflow generation through self-adaptive abstraction operators, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency while eliminating the need for manual operator predefinition.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in automating the design of agentic workflows. However, existing methods still rely heavily on manually predefined operators, limiting generalization and scalability. To address this issue, we propose $A^2Flow$, a fully automated framework for agentic workflow generation based on self-adaptive abstraction operators. $A^2Flow$ employs a three-stage operator extraction process: 1) Case-based Initial Operator Generation: leveraging expert demonstrations and LLM reasoning to generate case-specific operators; 2) Operator Clustering and Preliminary Abstraction: grouping similar operators across tasks to form preliminary abstractions; and 3) Deep Extraction for Abstract Execution Operators: applying long chain-of-thought prompting and multi-path reasoning to derive compact and generalizable execution operators. These operators serve as reusable building blocks for workflow construction without manual predefinition. Furthermore, we enhance node-level workflow search with an operator memory mechanism, which retains historical outputs to enrich context and improve decision-making. Experiments on general and embodied benchmarks show that $A^2Flow$ achieves a 2.4\% and 19.3\% average performance improvement and reduces resource usage by 37\% over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: Decomposing reasoning workflows using systems engineering approaches improves LLM performance on complex heliophysics problems requiring deductive reasoning.

Abstract: Scientific reasoning through Large Language Models in heliophysics involves more than just recalling facts: it requires incorporating physical assumptions, maintaining consistent units, and providing clear scientific formats through coordinated approaches. To address these challenges, we present Reasoning With a Star, a newly contributed heliophysics dataset applicable to reasoning; we also provide an initial benchmarking approach. Our data are constructed from National Aeronautics and Space Administration & University Corporation for Atmospheric Research Living With a Star summer school problem sets and compiled into a readily consumable question-and-answer structure with question contexts, reasoning steps, expected answer type, ground-truth targets, format hints, and metadata. A programmatic grader checks the predictions using unit-aware numerical tolerance, symbolic equivalence, and schema validation. We benchmark a single-shot baseline and four multi-agent patterns, finding that decomposing workflows through systems engineering principles outperforms direct prompting on problems requiring deductive reasoning rather than pure inductive recall.

### [129] [Cross Domain Evaluation of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Reasoning of different datasets into the Amazon CoT Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20701)
*Nitya Tiwari,Parv Maheshwari,Vidisha Agarwal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Analysis of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought reasoning across diverse domains (A-OKVQA, OKVQA, ChartQA) shows vision integration reduces hallucination but effectiveness varies significantly by question type, with commonsense reasoning being particularly challenging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the generalizability of Multimodal-CoT reasoning beyond scientific domains and assess its effectiveness on tasks requiring broad commonsense and world knowledge.

Method: Implemented two-stage framework separating rationale generation from answer inference, using gated fusion mechanism with T5-based language models to integrate vision features, with systematic ablation studies.

Result: Vision integration significantly reduces hallucination in rationale generation, but CoT reasoning effectiveness varies substantially across question types, with commonsense reasoning presenting particular challenges.

Conclusion: Provides practical insights for multimodal reasoning systems and identifies key areas for future improvement in cross-domain generalization.

Abstract: While recent work has extended CoT to multimodal settings, achieving state-of-the-art results on science question answering benchmarks like ScienceQA, the generalizability of these approaches across diverse domains remains underexplored. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (Multimodal-CoT) reasoning, evaluating its effectiveness on the A-OKVQA, OKVQA and ChartQA datasets, which requires broad commonsense and world knowledge beyond scientific reasoning. We implement the two-stage framework proposed by Zhang et al. [3], which separates rationale generation from answer inference and integrates vision features through a gated fusion mechanism with T5-based language models. Through systematic ablation studies, we analyze the contributions of vision features, rationale quality, and architectural choices. Our findings reveal that while vision integration significantly reduces hallucination in rationale generation, the effectiveness of CoT reasoning varies substantially across question types, with commonsense reasoning presenting particular challenges. This work provides practical insights for researchers implementing multimodal reasoning systems and identifies key areas for future improvement in cross-domain generalization.

### [130] [OpenApps: Simulating Environment Variations to Measure UI-Agent Reliability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20766)
*Karen Ullrich,Jingtong Su,Claudia Shi,Arjun Subramonian,Amir Bar,Ivan Evtimov,Nikolaos Tsilivis,Randall Balestriero,Julia Kempe,Mark Ibrahim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OpenApps is a lightweight open-source ecosystem with configurable apps to evaluate UI-Agent reliability across app variations, revealing significant performance fluctuations in leading multimodal agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations use fixed app environments, failing to measure how UI-Agents perform across real-world app variations in design and content that affect task completion reliability.

Method: Developed OpenApps with six configurable apps (messenger, calendar, maps, etc.) requiring only one CPU, enabling generation of thousands of app versions and running over 10,000 evaluations across seven multimodal agents.

Result: Agent reliability varies drastically across app variations - task success rates can fluctuate by over 50%. Kimi-VL-3B's average success dropped from 63% to 4% across different app versions. Agent behaviors like looping and hallucinating also differ significantly.

Conclusion: Measuring reliability across app variations is crucial for evaluating UI-Agent performance, as standard fixed-environment evaluations miss significant reliability fluctuations that occur in real-world deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Reliability is key to realizing the promise of autonomous UI-Agents, multimodal agents that directly interact with apps in the same manner as humans, as users must be able to trust an agent to complete a given task. Current evaluations rely on fixed environments, often clones of existing apps, which are limited in that they can only shed light on whether or how often an agent can complete a task within a specific environment. When deployed however, agents are likely to encounter variations in app design and content that can affect an agent's ability to complete a task. To address this blind spot of measuring agent reliability across app variations, we develop OpenApps, a light-weight open-source ecosystem with six apps (messenger, calendar, maps, etc.) that are configurable in appearance and content. OpenApps requires just a single CPU to run, enabling easy generation and deployment of thousands of versions of each app. Specifically, we run more than 10,000 independent evaluations to study reliability across seven leading multimodal agents. We find that while standard reliability within a fixed app is relatively stable, reliability can vary drastically when measured across app variations. Task success rates for many agents can fluctuate by more than $50\%$ across app variations. For example, Kimi-VL-3B's average success across all tasks fluctuates from $63\%$ to just $4\%$ across app versions. We also find agent behaviors such as looping or hallucinating actions can differ drastically depending on the environment configuration. These initial findings highlight the importance of measuring reliability along this new dimension of app variations. OpenApps is available at https://facebookresearch.github.io/OpenApps/

*Xuyuan Liu,Zhengzhang Chen,Xinshuai Dong,Yanchi Liu,Xujiang Zhao,Shengyu Chen,Haoyu Wang,Yujun Yan,Haifeng Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RILKE is a method for lifelong knowledge control in LLMs that uses representation-space interventions to efficiently update model knowledge without retraining, maintaining general utility while handling complex unstructured knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce incorrect or outdated content, and updating their knowledge efficiently without costly retraining is challenging, especially for complex unstructured knowledge in lifelong settings where many edits must coexist without interference.

Method: RILKE treats knowledge control as interventions in the model's representation space, learning paraphrase-robust and edit-localized modules that limit updates to low-dimensional subspaces to minimize interference. A query-adaptive router selects appropriate modules during inference.

Result: Evaluation on knowledge editing benchmarks with LLaMA and Qwen models shows RILKE is scalable to large datasets, achieving high edit success, strong paraphrase generalization, and preserved general utility with modest memory overhead.

Conclusion: RILKE is an effective and scalable solution for lifelong knowledge control in LLMs, enabling fine-grained control over complex knowledge while maintaining model utility with frozen base weights.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce incorrect or outdated content. Updating their knowledge efficiently and accurately without costly retraining is a major challenge. This problem is especially hard for complex, unstructured knowledge in a lifelong setting, where many edits must coexist without interference. We introduce RILKE (Representation Intervention for Lifelong KnowledgE Control), a robust and scalable method that treats knowledge control as interventions within the model's representation space. Leveraging representation-space expressiveness, we identify two properties enabling RILKE to deliver fine-grained control over complex, unstructured knowledge while maintaining general utility with frozen base weights. During training, RILKE learns paraphrase-robust and edit-localized modules that limit each update to a low-dimensional subspace to minimize cross-edit interference. In inference, a query-adaptive router selects the appropriate module to guide the model's generation. In evaluation on knowledge editing benchmarks with LLaMA and Qwen models, RILKE is scalable to large-scale datasets, demonstrating high edit success, strong paraphrase generalization, and preserving general utility with modest memory overhead. These results show RILKE is an effective and scalable solution for lifelong knowledge control in LLMs.

### [132] [Guaranteed Optimal Compositional Explanations for Neurons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20934)
*Biagio La Rosa,Leilani H. Gilpin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first framework for computing guaranteed optimal compositional explanations of neural networks, addressing limitations of beam search methods that lack theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current compositional explanations use beam search which cannot provide theoretical guarantees of optimality, making it unclear how close explanations are to the true optimum.

Method: Proposed framework includes: (i) decomposition identifying factors influencing spatial alignment, (ii) heuristic to estimate alignment during search, and (iii) first algorithm computing optimal explanations within feasible time.

Result: Analysis shows 10-40% of beam search explanations are suboptimal when overlapping concepts are involved. A beam-search variant using the proposed decomposition and heuristic matches or improves runtime while offering greater flexibility.

Conclusion: The framework enables computation of guaranteed optimal compositional explanations, revealing significant suboptimality in current methods and providing more efficient alternatives.

Abstract: While neurons are the basic units of deep neural networks, it is still unclear what they learn and if their knowledge is aligned with that of humans. Compositional explanations aim to answer this question by describing the spatial alignment between neuron activations and concepts through logical rules. These logical descriptions are typically computed via a search over all possible concept combinations. Since computing the spatial alignment over the entire state space is computationally infeasible, the literature commonly adopts beam search to restrict the space. However, beam search cannot provide any theoretical guarantees of optimality, and it remains unclear how close current explanations are to the true optimum. In this theoretical paper, we address this gap by introducing the first framework for computing guaranteed optimal compositional explanations. Specifically, we propose: (i) a decomposition that identifies the factors influencing the spatial alignment, (ii) a heuristic to estimate the alignment at any stage of the search, and (iii) the first algorithm that can compute optimal compositional explanations within a feasible time. Using this framework, we analyze the differences between optimal and non-optimal explanations in the most popular settings for compositional explanations, the computer vision domain and Convolutional Neural Networks. In these settings, we demonstrate that 10-40 percent of explanations obtained with beam search are suboptimal when overlapping concepts are involved. Finally, we evaluate a beam-search variant guided by our proposed decomposition and heuristic, showing that it matches or improves runtime over prior methods while offering greater flexibility in hyperparameters and computational resources.

### [133] [ENACT: Evaluating Embodied Cognition with World Modeling of Egocentric Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20937)
*Qineng Wang,Wenlong Huang,Yu Zhou,Hang Yin,Tianwei Bao,Jianwen Lyu,Weiyu Liu,Ruohan Zhang,Jiajun Wu,Li Fei-Fei,Manling Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ENACT is a benchmark that evaluates embodied cognition in vision-language models through world modeling tasks using egocentric interaction in VQA format, revealing performance gaps between models and humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether modern vision-language models exhibit signs of embodied cognition despite being trained in disembodied ways, by creating a systematic evaluation framework.

Method: ENACT uses two sequence reordering tasks (forward and inverse world modeling) framed as POMDP with scene graph changes, synthesized from robotics simulation data spanning long-horizon home activities.

Result: Frontier VLMs show performance gaps compared to humans that widen with interaction horizon, perform better on inverse tasks than forward tasks, and exhibit anthropocentric biases like right-hand preference.

Conclusion: Current VLMs demonstrate limitations in embodied cognition capabilities, particularly in forward world modeling and handling non-human viewpoints, suggesting room for improvement in embodied AI systems.

Abstract: Embodied cognition argues that intelligence arises from sensorimotor interaction rather than passive observation. It raises an intriguing question: do modern vision-language models (VLMs), trained largely in a disembodied manner, exhibit signs of embodied cognition? We introduce ENACT, a benchmark that casts evaluation of embodied cognition as world modeling from egocentric interaction in a visual question answering (VQA) format. Framed as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) whose actions are scene graph changes, ENACT comprises two complementary sequence reordering tasks: forward world modeling (reorder shuffled observations given actions) and inverse world modeling (reorder shuffled actions given observations). While conceptually simple, solving these tasks implicitly demands capabilities central to embodied cognition-affordance recognition, action-effect reasoning, embodied awareness, and interactive, long-horizon memory from partially observable egocentric input, while avoiding low-level image synthesis that could confound the evaluation. We provide a scalable pipeline that synthesizes QA pairs from robotics simulation (BEHAVIOR) and evaluates models on 8,972 QA pairs spanning long-horizon home-scale activities. Experiments reveal a performance gap between frontier VLMs and humans that widens with interaction horizon. Models consistently perform better on the inverse task than the forward one and exhibit anthropocentric biases, including a preference for right-handed actions and degradation when camera intrinsics or viewpoints deviate from human vision.

*Rahul Dass,Thomas Bowlin,Zebing Li,Xiao Jin,Ashok Goel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Ivy is an AI coaching system that combines symbolic TMK models with LLMs to generate structured, multi-step explanations for procedural skills, outperforming GPT baselines in explanation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce fluent but shallow explanations that miss the causal, goal-directed, and compositional logic needed for effective procedural skill learning.

Method: Combine symbolic Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK) models with LLMs, where TMK encodes causal transitions, goal hierarchies, and problem decompositions to constrain LLM explanations within explicit structural bounds.

Result: Ivy consistently outperforms GPT and retrieval-augmented GPT baselines across three inferential dimensions, showing improved structural quality for 'how' and 'why' questions.

Conclusion: Symbolic constraints strengthen the pedagogical value of AI-generated explanations, demonstrating a scalable AI for education approach in intelligent coaching systems.

Abstract: In procedural skill learning, instructional explanations must convey not just steps, but the causal, goal-directed, and compositional logic behind them. Large language models (LLMs) often produce fluent yet shallow responses that miss this structure. We present Ivy, an AI coaching system that delivers structured, multi-step explanations by combining symbolic Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK) models with a generative interpretation layer-an LLM that constructs explanations while being constrained by TMK structure. TMK encodes causal transitions, goal hierarchies, and problem decompositions, and guides the LLM within explicit structural bounds. We evaluate Ivy against responses against GPT and retrieval-augmented GPT baselines using expert and independent annotations across three inferential dimensions. Results show that symbolic constraints consistently improve the structural quality of explanations for "how" and "why" questions. This study demonstrates a scalable AI for education approach that strengthens the pedagogical value of AI-generated explanations in intelligent coaching systems.

### [135] [ICPO: Intrinsic Confidence-Driven Group Relative Preference Optimization for Efficient Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21005)
*Jinpeng Wang,Chao Li,Ting Ye,Mengyuan Zhang,Wei Liu,Jian Luan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ICPO method enhances LLM reasoning by using intrinsic confidence and relative preference optimization to address RLVR limitations like coarse rewards and inefficient exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods suffer from coarse-grained rewards, reward noise, and inefficient exploration, causing unstable training and entropy collapse in LLM reasoning enhancement.

Method: ICPO calculates preference advantage scores by comparing generation probabilities of multiple responses under the same prompt, integrating these scores with verifiable rewards to guide exploration.

Result: ICPO alleviates coarse-grained rewards and reward noise, curbs overconfident errors, enhances undervalued high-quality responses, and prevents overfitting to specific strategies.

Conclusion: Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show ICPO steadily boosts reasoning performance compared to GRPO.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) demonstrates significant potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing RLVR methods are often constrained by issues such as coarse-grained rewards, reward noise, and inefficient exploration, which lead to unstable training and entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we propose the Intrinsic Confidence-Driven Group Relative Preference Optimization method (ICPO). The intuition behind it lies in the fact that the probabilities of an LLM generating different responses can inherently and directly reflect its self-assessment of the reasoning process. Inspired by the idea of preference modeling, ICPO calculates a preference advantage score for each response by comparing the relative generation probabilities of multiple responses under the same input prompt, and integrates this score with verifiable rewards to guide the exploration process. We have discovered that the preference advantage score not only alleviates the issues of coarse-grained rewards and reward noise but also effectively curbs overconfident errors, enhances the relative superiority of undervalued high-quality responses, and prevents the model from overfitting to specific strategies, thereby facilitating more thorough exploration. Comprehensive experiments across four general-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that ICPO steadily boosts reasoning compared to GRPO.

### [136] [Towards Trustworthy Legal AI through LLM Agents and Formal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21033)
*Linze Chen,Yufan Cai,Zhe Hou,Jinsong Dong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: L4M is a framework combining adversarial LLM agents with SMT-solver proofs to bridge natural language interpretation with symbolic verification for legal reasoning, outperforming state-of-the-art models while providing explainable justifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based legal systems lack guarantees for principled jurisprudence and cannot ensure both substantive rationality (fair outcomes) and formal rationality (rule-following decisions) required in legal reasoning.

Method: Three-phase pipeline: (1) Statute Formalization - convert legal provisions to logical formulae; (2) Dual Fact and Statute Extraction - prosecutor/defense LLMs independently extract facts and statutes; (3) Solver-Centric Adjudication - compile arguments into logic constraints with iterative self-critique via unsat cores, then verbalize verdict.

Result: Outperforms advanced LLMs (GPT-4-mini, DeepSeek-V3, Claude 4) and state-of-the-art Legal AI baselines on public benchmarks while providing rigorous symbolic justifications.

Conclusion: L4M successfully unites the interpretive flexibility of natural language with the rigor of symbolic verification, enabling both substantive and formal rationality in legal AI systems with transparent, explainable decision-making.

Abstract: The rationality of law manifests in two forms: substantive rationality, which concerns the fairness or moral desirability of outcomes, and formal rationality, which requires legal decisions to follow explicitly stated, general, and logically coherent rules. Existing LLM-based systems excel at surface-level text analysis but lack the guarantees required for principled jurisprudence. We introduce L4M, a novel framework that combines adversarial LLM agents with SMT-solver-backed proofs to unite the interpretive flexibility of natural language with the rigor of symbolic verification. The pipeline consists of three phases: (1) Statute Formalization, where domain-specific prompts convert legal provisions into logical formulae; (2) Dual Fact and Statute Extraction, in which prosecutor- and defense-aligned LLMs independently map case narratives to fact tuples and statutes, ensuring role isolation; and (3) Solver-Centric Adjudication, where an autoformalizer compiles both parties' arguments into logic constraints, and unsat cores trigger iterative self-critique until a satisfiable formula is achieved, which is then verbalized by a Judge-LLM into a transparent verdict and optimized sentence. Experimental results on public benchmarks show that our system surpasses advanced LLMs including GPT-o4-mini, DeepSeek-V3, and Claude 4 as well as state-of-the-art Legal AI baselines, while providing rigorous and explainable symbolic justifications.

*Chujie Wang,Jianyu Lu,Zhiyuan Luo,Xi Chen,Chu He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OVOD-Agent transforms passive category matching into proactive visual reasoning and self-evolving detection using a Visual Chain-of-Thought approach with weakly Markovian decision processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Open-Vocabulary Object Detection methods have a gap between multimodal training and unimodal inference, with textual space being underexplored despite its importance for performance.

Method: Proposes OVOD-Agent with Visual-CoT paradigm, models visual context transitions as Weakly Markovian Decision Process over eight state spaces, uses Bandit module for exploration, and integrates Markov transitions with Bandit trajectories for self-supervised Reward Model optimization.

Result: Experiments on COCO and LVIS show consistent improvements across OVOD backbones, particularly on rare categories.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively bridges the gap between multimodal training and unimodal inference in OVOD, demonstrating the value of proactive visual reasoning and self-evolving detection.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) aims to enable detectors to generalize across categories by leveraging semantic information. Although existing methods are pretrained on large vision-language datasets, their inference is still limited to fixed category names, creating a gap between multimodal training and unimodal inference. Previous work has shown that improving textual representation can significantly enhance OVOD performance, indicating that the textual space is still underexplored. To this end, we propose OVOD-Agent, which transforms passive category matching into proactive visual reasoning and self-evolving detection. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm, OVOD-Agent extends the textual optimization process into an interpretable Visual-CoT with explicit actions. OVOD's lightweight nature makes LLM-based management unsuitable; instead, we model visual context transitions as a Weakly Markovian Decision Process (w-MDP) over eight state spaces, which naturally represents the agent's state, memory, and interaction dynamics. A Bandit module generates exploration signals under limited supervision, helping the agent focus on uncertain regions and adapt its detection policy. We further integrate Markov transition matrices with Bandit trajectories for self-supervised Reward Model (RM) optimization, forming a closed loop from Bandit exploration to RM learning. Experiments on COCO and LVIS show that OVOD-Agent provides consistent improvements across OVOD backbones, particularly on rare categories, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

*Joseph Y. Halpern,Rafael Pass*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper abstracts Halpern and Pearl's causality definition to work with any model supporting counterfactuals, enabling broader applications including disjunctions, negations, beliefs, and nested counterfactuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend Halpern and Pearl's causality definition beyond causal models to any model with counterfactuals, addressing limitations in handling complex formulas and enabling wider applicability.

Method: Abstracting the key features of Halpern-Pearl's causality definition to create a generalized framework that can be applied to any model where counterfactuals are defined.

Result: The abstracted definition works with models allowing backtracking and can handle formulas with disjunctions, negations, beliefs, and nested counterfactuals, which the original definition cannot.

Conclusion: Abstracting the causality definition provides broader applicability, deeper understanding of the original definition, and enables extension to abstract definitions of explanation beyond causal models.

Abstract: Perhaps the most prominent current definition of (actual) causality is due to Halpern and Pearl.  It is defined using causal models (also known as structural equations models).  We abstract the definition, extracting its key features, so that it can be applied to any other model where counterfactuals are defined. By abstracting the definition, we gain a number of benefits. Not only can we apply the definition in a wider range of models, including ones that allow, for example, backtracking, but we can apply the definition to determine if A is a cause of B  even if A and B are formulas involving disjunctions, negations, beliefs, and nested counterfactuals (none of which can be handled by the Halpern-Pearl definition). Moreover, we can extend the ideas to getting an abstract definition of explanation that can be applied beyond causal models. Finally, we gain a deeper understanding of features of the definition  even in causal models.

*Jiayuan Zhang,Kaiquan Chen,Zhihao Lu,Enshen Zhou,Qian Yu,Jing Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Prune4Web introduces programmatic DOM pruning to handle large web page structures efficiently, shifting from LLM reading to executable scoring scripts for 25-50x element reduction and 88.28% grounding accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing web automation struggles with massive DOM structures (10k-100k tokens) where crude truncation loses critical information and inefficient heuristics fail to balance precision and scalability.

Method: DOM Tree Pruning Programming where LLM generates Python scoring scripts to dynamically filter elements based on semantic cues from sub-tasks, plus unified training of Planner, Programmatic Filter, and Grounder.

Result: Achieves 25-50x reduction in candidate elements and dramatically improves low-level grounding accuracy from 46.8% to 88.28%, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Programmatic DOM pruning effectively addresses web automation challenges by enabling precise action localization while mitigating attention dilution through efficient element filtering.

Abstract: Web automation employs intelligent agents to execute high-level tasks by mimicking human interactions with web interfaces. Despite the capabilities of recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents, navigating complex, real-world webpages efficiently remains a significant hurdle due to the prohibitively large size of Document Object Model (DOM) structures, often ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 tokens. Existing strategies typically rely on crude DOM truncation -- risking the loss of critical information -- or employ inefficient heuristics and separate ranking models, failing to achieve an optimal balance between precision and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce Prune4Web, a novel paradigm that shifts DOM processing from resource-intensive LLM reading to efficient programmatic pruning. Central to our approach is DOM Tree Pruning Programming, where an LLM generates executable Python scoring scripts to dynamically filter DOM elements based on semantic cues from decomposed sub-tasks. This mechanism eliminates the need for LLMs to ingest raw, massive DOMs, instead delegating traversal and scoring to lightweight, interpretable programs. This methodology achieves a 25x to 50x reduction in candidate elements for grounding, thereby facilitating precise action localization while mitigating attention dilution. Furthermore, we propose a specialized data annotation pipeline and a two-turn dialogue training strategy that jointly optimizes the Planner, Programmatic Filter, and Grounder within a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on our low-level grounding task, Prune4Web dramatically improves accuracy from 46.8% to 88.28%, underscoring its efficacy in real-world web automation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ChatDRex is a conversation-based multi-agent system that enables natural language access to biomedical knowledge graphs for network-based drug repurposing prediction, allowing non-experts to conduct complex bioinformatic analyses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drug repurposing is time-efficient and cost-effective, but current in silico prediction methods require specialized expertise and fragmented tools that don't integrate well across workflows, limiting accessibility for clinical experts.

Method: Builds on NeDRex knowledge graph and uses a multi-agent system with specialized agents for query routing, data retrieval, network analysis, drug repurposing, functional coherence evaluation, literature mining, and result visualization with natural language interface.

Result: Provides natural language access to extensive biomedical knowledge and enables physicians without computer science expertise to control complex analyses, democratizing access to bioinformatics for drug repurposing.

Conclusion: ChatDRex facilitates hypothesis generation and exploration of drug repurposing opportunities, accelerating novel therapy discovery and advancing personalized medicine and translational research by making bioinformatics accessible to clinical experts.

Abstract: Repurposing approved drugs offers a time-efficient and cost-effective alternative to traditional drug development. However, in silico prediction of repurposing candidates is challenging and requires the effective collaboration of specialists in various fields, including pharmacology, medicine, biology, and bioinformatics. Fragmented, specialized algorithms and tools often address only narrow aspects of the overall problem, and heterogeneous, unstructured data landscapes require specialized users to be involved. Hence, these data services do not integrate smoothly across workflows. With ChatDRex, we present a conversation-based, multi-agent system that facilitates the execution of complex bioinformatic analyses aiming for network-based drug repurposing prediction. It builds on the integrated systems medicine knowledge graph NeDRex. ChatDRex provides natural language access to its extensive biomedical KG and integrates bioinformatics agents for network analysis and drug repurposing, complemented by agents for functional coherence evaluation for in silico validation, as well as agents for literature mining and for discussing the obtained results in a scientific context. Its flexible multi-agent design assigns specific tasks to specialized agents, including query routing, data retrieval, algorithm execution, and result visualization. A dedicated reasoning module keeps the user in the loop and allows for hallucination detection. By enabling physicians and researchers without computer science expertise to control complex analyses in natural language, ChatDRex democratizes access to bioinformatics as an important resource for drug repurposing. It enables clinical experts to generate hypotheses and explore drug repurposing opportunities, ultimately accelerating the discovery of novel therapies and advancing personalized medicine and translational research.

TL;DR: EWE is the first AI framework for automated extreme weather diagnosis that emulates expert workflows through knowledge-guided planning and multimodal visualization analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extreme weather events are increasing globally, but current manual diagnostic methods create analytical bottlenecks that hinder scientific progress. AI has advanced in weather prediction but automated diagnostic reasoning remains unexplored.

Method: EWE uses knowledge-guided planning, closed-loop reasoning, and a meteorological toolkit to autonomously produce and interpret multimodal visualizations from raw weather data, emulating expert diagnostic workflows.

Result: The framework successfully performs comprehensive diagnostic analyses and the authors introduce the first benchmark for this field with 103 high-impact events and a step-wise evaluation metric.

Conclusion: EWE represents progress toward automated scientific discovery and has potential to democratize weather expertise, especially benefiting developing nations vulnerable to extreme weather.

Abstract: Extreme weather events pose escalating risks to global society, underscoring the urgent need to unravel their underlying physical mechanisms. Yet the prevailing expert-driven, labor-intensive diagnostic paradigm has created a critical analytical bottleneck, stalling scientific progress. While AI for Earth Science has achieved notable advances in prediction, the equally essential challenge of automated diagnostic reasoning remains largely unexplored. We present the Extreme Weather Expert (EWE), the first intelligent agent framework dedicated to this task. EWE emulates expert workflows through knowledge-guided planning, closed-loop reasoning, and a domain-tailored meteorological toolkit. It autonomously produces and interprets multimodal visualizations from raw meteorological data, enabling comprehensive diagnostic analyses. To catalyze progress, we introduce the first benchmark for this emerging field, comprising a curated dataset of 103 high-impact events and a novel step-wise evaluation metric. EWE marks a step toward automated scientific discovery and offers the potential to democratize expertise and intellectual resources, particularly for developing nations vulnerable to extreme weather.

*Junjian Wang,Lidan Zhao,Xi Sheryl Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MADRA is a training-free multi-agent debate framework that enhances safety assessment for embodied AI agents through collective reasoning, achieving over 90% unsafe task rejection while maintaining low safe-task rejection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for ensuring embodied AI safety suffer from high computational costs or over-rejection of safe tasks, creating barriers for real-world deployment in household environments.

Method: Proposes MADRA framework with multiple LLM agents debating instruction safety, guided by a critical evaluator scoring responses on logical soundness, risk identification, evidence quality, and clarity. Uses iterative deliberation and consensus voting.

Result: Achieves over 90% rejection of unsafe tasks while keeping safe-task rejection low, outperforming existing methods in both safety and execution efficiency on AI2-THOR and VirtualHome benchmarks.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable, model-agnostic solution for building trustworthy embodied agents through collective reasoning without requiring training.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of embodied AI agents during task planning is critical for real-world deployment, especially in household environments where dangerous instructions pose significant risks. Existing methods often suffer from either high computational costs due to preference alignment training or over-rejection when using single-agent safety prompts. To address these limitations, we propose MADRA, a training-free Multi-Agent Debate Risk Assessment framework that leverages collective reasoning to enhance safety awareness without sacrificing task performance. MADRA employs multiple LLM-based agents to debate the safety of a given instruction, guided by a critical evaluator that scores responses based on logical soundness, risk identification, evidence quality, and clarity. Through iterative deliberation and consensus voting, MADRA significantly reduces false rejections while maintaining high sensitivity to dangerous tasks. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical cognitive collaborative planning framework that integrates safety, memory, planning, and self-evolution mechanisms to improve task success rates through continuous learning. We also contribute SafeAware-VH, a benchmark dataset for safety-aware task planning in VirtualHome, containing 800 annotated instructions. Extensive experiments on AI2-THOR and VirtualHome demonstrate that our approach achieves over 90% rejection of unsafe tasks while ensuring that safe-task rejection is low, outperforming existing methods in both safety and execution efficiency. Our work provides a scalable, model-agnostic solution for building trustworthy embodied agents.

### [144] [SpatialBench: Benchmarking Multimodal Large Language Models for Spatial Cognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21471)
*Peiran Xu,Sudong Wang,Yao Zhu,Jianing Li,Yunjian Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a hierarchical spatial cognition framework with 5 levels and SpatialBench benchmark to systematically evaluate multimodal LLMs' spatial reasoning abilities, revealing models' limitations in higher-level reasoning despite strong perceptual grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks oversimplify spatial cognition as single-dimensional metrics, failing to capture the hierarchical structure and interdependence of spatial abilities needed for real-world multimodal intelligence.

Method: Developed a hierarchical framework decomposing spatial intelligence into 5 progressive levels, constructed SpatialBench with 15 tasks across these levels, and introduced a unified capability-oriented metric for evaluation.

Result: Models show strong perceptual grounding but limitations in symbolic reasoning, causal inference, and planning. Human tests reveal humans perform goal-directed abstraction while MLLMs over-attend to surface details without coherent spatial intent.

Conclusion: Establishes the first systematic framework for measuring hierarchical spatial cognition in MLLMs, providing foundation for developing spatially intelligent systems.

Abstract: Spatial cognition is fundamental to real-world multimodal intelligence, allowing models to effectively interact with the physical environment. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant strides, existing benchmarks often oversimplify spatial cognition, reducing it to a single-dimensional metric, which fails to capture the hierarchical structure and interdependence of spatial abilities. To address this gap, we propose a hierarchical spatial cognition framework that decomposes spatial intelligence into five progressively complex levels from basic observation to high-level planning. Building upon this taxonomy, we construct SpatialBench, a large-scale, fine-grained benchmark covering 15 tasks aligned with these cognitive levels. To provide a unified evaluation across heterogeneous tasks, we further introduce a high-level capability-oriented metric that reliably assesses a model's overall spatial reasoning ability. Extensive experiments over massive MLLMs reveal distinct performance stratification across cognitive levels: models exhibit strong perceptual grounding yet remain limited in symbolic reasoning, causal inference, and planning. Additional human tests demonstrate that humans perform selective, goal-directed abstraction, while MLLMs tend to over-attend to surface details without coherent spatial intent. Our work establishes the first systematic framework for measuring hierarchical spatial cognition in MLLMs, laying the foundation for future spatially intelligent systems.

### [145] [Pessimistic Verification for Open Ended Math Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21522)
*Yanxing Huang,Zihan Tang,Zejin Lin,Peng Li,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Pessimistic verification improves math proof verification by running multiple parallel checks and rejecting proofs if any check finds an error, significantly boosting performance without high computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The key limitation in verification performance is error detection ability, so the authors aimed to improve verification of open-ended math questions through simple but effective workflows.

Method: Designed pessimistic verification variants that construct multiple parallel verifications for the same proof, deeming the proof incorrect if any verification reports an error.

Result: Significantly improved performance across math verification benchmarks without substantial computational resources, with token efficiency surpassing extended long-CoT in test-time scaling. Case studies showed many false negatives were actually dataset annotation errors.

Conclusion: Self-verification for mathematical problems improves reliability and performance of language model outputs, and pessimistic verification research will enhance mathematical capabilities of language models across various tasks.

Abstract: The key limitation of the verification performance lies in the ability of error detection. With this intuition we designed several variants of pessimistic verification, which are simple workflows that could significantly improve the verification of open-ended math questions. In pessimistic verification we construct multiple parallel verifications for the same proof, and the proof is deemed incorrect if any one of them reports an error. This simple technique significantly improves the performance across many math verification benchmarks without incurring substantial computational resources. Its token efficiency even surpassed extended long-CoT in test-time scaling. Our case studies further indicate that the majority of false negatives in stronger models are actually caused by annotation errors in the original dataset, so our method's performance is in fact underestimated. Self-verification for mathematical problems can effectively improve the reliability and performance of language model outputs, and it also plays a critical role in enabling long-horizon mathematical tasks. We believe that research on pessimistic verification will help enhance the mathematical capabilities of language models across a wide range of tasks.

### [146] [Self-Transparency Failures in Expert-Persona LLMs: A Large-Scale Behavioral Audit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21569)
*Alex Diep*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI models show inconsistent self-disclosure of their AI identity across professional domains, with disclosure rates ranging from 2.8% to 73.6% depending on persona, creating risks of misplaced user trust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine whether language models can reliably disclose their AI identity when assigned professional personas in high-stakes domains, as failure to do so risks user harm through false expertise.

Method: Used a common-garden design to audit 16 open-weight models (4B-671B parameters) across 19,200 trials, testing disclosure rates across different professional personas like Financial Advisor and Neurosurgeon.

Result: Models showed sharp domain-specific inconsistency in disclosure (30.8% for Financial Advisor vs 3.5% for Neurosurgeon), with model identity being a better predictor than parameter count. Reasoning optimization actively suppressed self-transparency in some models.

Conclusion: Transparency reflects training factors rather than scale, requiring deliberate behavior design and empirical verification rather than assuming safety properties transfer to deployment contexts.

Abstract: If a language model cannot reliably disclose its AI identity in expert contexts, users cannot trust its competence boundaries. This study examines self-transparency in models assigned professional personas within high-stakes domains where false expertise risks user harm. Using a common-garden design, sixteen open-weight models (4B--671B parameters) were audited across 19,200 trials. Models exhibited sharp domain-specific inconsistency: a Financial Advisor persona elicited 30.8% disclosure initially, while a Neurosurgeon persona elicited only 3.5%. This creates preconditions for a "Reverse Gell-Mann Amnesia" effect, where transparency in some domains leads users to overgeneralize trust to contexts where disclosure fails. Disclosure ranged from 2.8% to 73.6%, with a 14B model reaching 61.4% while a 70B produced just 4.1%. Model identity predicted behavior better than parameter count ($ΔR_{adj}^{2} = 0.359$ vs 0.018). Reasoning optimization actively suppressed self-transparency in some models, with reasoning variants showing up to 48.4% lower disclosure than base counterparts. Bayesian validation with Rogan--Gladen correction confirmed robustness to measurement error ($κ= 0.908$). These findings demonstrate transparency reflects training factors rather than scale. Organizations cannot assume safety properties transfer to deployment contexts, requiring deliberate behavior design and empirical verification.

*Maria Perez-Ortiz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'responsible computational foresight' as a framework combining AI and computational modeling with ethical foresight to help policymakers navigate future uncertainties and shape sustainable futures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In an era of rapid technological change and complex global challenges, there is a need for ethical frameworks that help policymakers anticipate emerging opportunities and risks while fostering proactive, sustainable future design.

Method: The paper establishes foundational principles for responsible computational foresight and presents AI-driven foresight tools that work with simulations and scenario analysis to enhance policymakers' ability to address uncertainty and evaluate risks.

Result: The research shows that AI can enhance policymakers' foresight capabilities when used as a supportive tool alongside human judgment, enabling better risk evaluation and strategy development for sustainable futures.

Conclusion: AI should be thoughtfully integrated as a supportive tool in human-centered foresight practices, complementing rather than replacing policymaker judgment to enable proactive shaping of resilient and ethically sound futures.

Abstract: In an era marked by rapid technological advancements and complex global challenges, responsible foresight has emerged as an essential framework for policymakers aiming to navigate future uncertainties and shape the future. Responsible foresight entails the ethical anticipation of emerging opportunities and risks, with a focus on fostering proactive, sustainable, and accountable future design. This paper coins the term "responsible computational foresight", examining the role of human-centric artificial intelligence and computational modeling in advancing responsible foresight, establishing a set of foundational principles for this new field and presenting a suite of AI-driven foresight tools currently shaping it. AI, particularly in conjunction with simulations and scenario analysis, enhances policymakers' ability to address uncertainty, evaluate risks, and devise strategies geared toward sustainable, resilient futures. However, responsible foresight extends beyond mere technical forecasting; it demands a nuanced understanding of the interdependencies within social, environmental, economic and political systems, alongside a commitment to ethical, long-term decision-making that supports human intelligence. We argue that AI will play a role as a supportive tool in responsible, human-centered foresight, complementing rather than substituting policymaker judgment to enable the proactive shaping of resilient and ethically sound futures. This paper advocates for the thoughtful integration of AI into foresight practices to empower policymakers and communities as they confront the grand challenges of the 21st century.

*Dan Li,Hye-Bin Shin,Yeon-Woo Choi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProNECL framework enables continual EEG decoding across subjects without storing historical data by using class-level prototypes and cross-subject feature alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG signals vary significantly between individuals, causing knowledge from previous subjects to be overwritten in continual learning. Privacy and memory constraints make storing historical EEG data impractical.

Method: Constructs class-level prototypes to summarize discriminative representations from each subject, then incrementally aligns new feature spaces with global prototype memory through cross-subject feature alignment and knowledge distillation.

Result: Validated on BCI Competition IV 2a and 2b datasets, effectively balances knowledge retention and adaptability, achieving superior performance in cross-subject continual EEG decoding tasks.

Conclusion: ProNECL framework successfully preserves prior knowledge without accessing historical EEG samples, addressing privacy and memory constraints in continual EEG decoding.

Abstract: Due to the significant variability in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals across individuals, knowledge acquired from previous subjects is often overwritten as new subjects are introduced in continual EEG decoding task. Current works mainly rely on storing the historical data of seen subjects as a replay buffer to prevent forgetting. However, privacy concerns or memory constraints make keeping such data impractical. Instead, we propose a Prototype-guided Non-Exemplar Continual Learning (ProNECL)framework that preserves prior knowledge without accessing any historical EEG samples. ProNECL constructs class-level prototypes to summarize discriminative representations from each subject and incrementally aligns new feature spaces with the global prototype memory through cross-subject feature alignment and knowledge distillation. Validated on the BCI Competition IV 2a and 2b datasets, our framework effectively balances knowledge retention and adaptability, achieving superior performance in cross-subject continual EEG decoding tasks.

*Tsubasa Masumura,Masato Taki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper establishes a generalized correspondence between modern Hopfield networks and Transformers by introducing modern Hopfield attention (MHA), which adds hidden states to self-attention to improve attention weights and address rank collapse/token uniformity issues in deep Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the relationship between modern Hopfield networks and self-attention beyond the adiabatic approximation, and leverage Hopfield network insights to improve Transformer architectures.

Method: Proposed modern Hopfield attention (MHA) that adds hidden states derived from modern Hopfield networks to self-attention, enabling inheritance of attention scores across Transformer layers.

Result: MHA significantly improves rank collapse and token uniformity problems in deep Transformers, and systematically enhances accuracy without adding parameters to Vision Transformer and GPT models.

Conclusion: Hopfield networks provide a useful perspective for improving Transformer architecture, with MHA demonstrating practical benefits for deep learning models.

Abstract: Associative memory models based on Hopfield networks and self-attention based on key-value mechanisms have been popular approaches in the study of memory mechanisms in deep learning. It has been pointed out that the state update rule of the modern Hopfield network (MHN) in the adiabatic approximation is in agreement with the self-attention layer of Transformer. In this paper, we go beyond this approximation and investigate the relationship between MHN and self-attention. Our results show that the correspondence between Hopfield networks and Transformers can be established in a more generalized form by adding a new variable, the hidden state derived from the MHN, to self-attention. This new attention mechanism, modern Hopfield attention (MHA), allows the inheritance of attention scores from the input layer of the Transformer to the output layer, which greatly improves the nature of attention weights. In particular, we show both theoretically and empirically that MHA hidden states significantly improve serious problem of deep Transformers known as rank collapse and token uniformity. We also confirm that MHA can systematically improve accuracy without adding training parameters to the Vision Transformer or GPT. Our results provide a new case in which Hopfield networks can be a useful perspective for improving the Transformer architecture.

*Chinmay Tripurwar,Utkarsh Maurya,Dishant*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Data-Free Knowledge Distillation framework using DeepInversion to synthesize privacy-preserving images from pre-trained models, enabling effective model pruning without accessing original training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of model pruning in privacy-sensitive domains where access to original training data is restricted due to regulations like GDPR and HIPAA, preventing fine-tuning on real data.

Method: Utilize DeepInversion to synthesize 'dream' images by inverting Batch Normalization statistics from pre-trained teacher models, then use these synthetic images for knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge to pruned student networks.

Result: Experimental results on CIFAR-10 across ResNet, MobileNet, and VGG architectures show significant accuracy recovery after pruning without accessing any real training data.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully bridges the gap between model compression and data privacy, enabling effective pruning in privacy-sensitive scenarios where original data is unavailable.

Abstract: Model pruning is a widely adopted technique to reduce the computational complexity and memory footprint of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, global unstructured pruning often leads to significant degradation in accuracy, typically necessitating fine-tuning on the original training dataset to recover performance. In privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare or finance, access to the original training data is often restricted post-deployment due to regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA). This paper proposes a Data-Free Knowledge Distillation framework to bridge the gap between model compression and data privacy. We utilize DeepInversion to synthesize privacy-preserving ``dream'' images from the pre-trained teacher model by inverting Batch Normalization (BN) statistics. These synthetic images serve as a transfer set to distill knowledge from the original teacher to the pruned student network. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 across various architectures (ResNet, MobileNet, VGG) demonstrate that our method significantly recovers accuracy lost during pruning without accessing a single real data point.

*Frederico Wieser,Martin Benfeghoul,Haitham Bou Ammar,Jun Wang,Zafeirios Fountas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Subjective Depth Transformers (SDT) and Subjective Timescale Transformers (STT) that use Bayesian surprise signals to dynamically route computation in decoder-only Transformers, reducing computation by 75% and KV-cache by 50% while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Transformer architectures have rigid, uniform computation allocation that limits efficiency and scalability for large models and long sequences. There's a need for more flexible computation routing.

Method: SDT uses alternating Decision and Dynamic layers with Bayesian surprise-based routing. STT extends to temporal domain with transition networks predicting residual updates and dynamic block execution based on temporal change hypotheses.

Result: Both architectures reduce self-attention computation by 75% and KV-cache requirements by 50% within compute skipping layers. They show shift from novelty to prediction-driven gating during training, aligning with surprise-based principles.

Conclusion: The proposed architectures provide a flexible framework for efficient Transformers through conditional computation, establishing pathways for more scalable and efficient models while offering insights into compute-accuracy trade-offs.

Abstract: The rigid, uniform allocation of computation in standard Transformer (TF) architectures can limit their efficiency and scalability, particularly for large-scale models and long sequences. Addressing this, we introduce Subjective Depth Transformers (SDT) and Subjective Timescale Transformers (STT), two distinct architectures that leverage Bayesian surprise signals to dynamically route computation, learning where and when to compute within decoder-only TFs. SDT augments a decoder-only stack with alternating Decision and Dynamic layers: a Decision layer computes a full block 'posterior' and a lightweight 'prior,' while a Dynamic layer employs fixed-capacity Top-K routing based on Bayesian surprise (Expected and Unexpected Change), maintaining a static compute graph. STT extends this conditional computation to the temporal domain: a transition network predicts residual updates, forming a temporal 'change hypothesis' that informs a router to dynamically execute or bypass TF blocks for each token, managing KV-cache contributions. Both architectures exhibit the predicted shift from novelty to prediction driven gating over training, suggesting alignment with surprise based principles. While operating at reduced capacity, they offer preliminary insights into the compute-accuracy trade-offs of conditional computation. The proposed architectures establish a flexible framework for efficiency, reducing self-attention computation by 75% and KV-cache requirements by 50% within each compute skipping layer, setting a pathway for more efficient models.

TL;DR: Transformer-based framework combining diffusion synthetic data generation with graph representation learning for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, addressing data limitations and class imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early and accurate AD detection is crucial but challenging due to limited labeled data, multi-site heterogeneity, and class imbalance in clinical datasets.

Method: Class-conditional DDPM generates balanced synthetic data; modality-specific Graph Transformers pretrained on synthetic data, then frozen while classifier trained on real data embeddings.

Result: Outperforms baselines including MaGNet with higher AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity under subject-wise cross-validation on NACC dataset.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based synthetic pretraining with Graph Transformers improves generalization in low-sample, imbalanced clinical prediction settings.

Abstract: Early and accurate detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial for enabling timely intervention and improving outcomes. However, developing reliable machine learning (ML) models for AD diagnosis is challenging due to limited labeled data, multi-site heterogeneity, and class imbalance. We propose a Transformer-based diagnostic framework that combines diffusion-based synthetic data generation with graph representation learning and transfer learning. A class-conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) is trained on the real-world NACC dataset to generate a large synthetic cohort that mirrors multimodal clinical and neuroimaging feature distributions while balancing diagnostic classes. Modality-specific Graph Transformer encoders are first pretrained on this synthetic data to learn robust, class-discriminative representations and are then frozen while a neural classifier is trained on embeddings from the original NACC data. We quantify distributional alignment between real and synthetic cohorts using metrics such as Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), Frechet distance, and energy distance, and complement discrimination metrics with calibration and fixed-specificity sensitivity analyses. Empirically, our framework outperforms standard baselines, including early and late fusion deep neural networks and the multimodal graph-based model MaGNet, yielding higher AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity under subject-wise cross-validation on NACC. These results show that diffusion-based synthetic pretraining with Graph Transformers can improve generalization in low-sample, imbalanced clinical prediction settings.

*Bilal Ahmed,Joseph G. Makin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RePS is a diffusion-based framework for inverse problems that uses restart-based sampling to efficiently handle both linear and non-linear measurement models without expensive gradient backpropagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion methods for inverse problems rely on strong posterior approximations, require expensive gradient computations, or are limited to linear models, creating a need for more general and efficient approaches.

Method: Extends restart-based sampling from unconditional diffusion to posterior inference, using a conditioned ODE for any differentiable measurement model with a simplified restart strategy to contract approximation errors.

Result: RePS achieves faster convergence and superior reconstruction quality compared to existing diffusion baselines across various linear and non-linear inverse problems.

Conclusion: The proposed RePS framework provides an efficient and general solution for inverse problems using diffusion models, overcoming limitations of prior methods while maintaining high reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Inverse problems are fundamental to science and engineering, where the goal is to infer an underlying signal or state from incomplete or noisy measurements. Recent approaches employ diffusion models as powerful implicit priors for such problems, owing to their ability to capture complex data distributions. However, existing diffusion-based methods for inverse problems often rely on strong approximations of the posterior distribution, require computationally expensive gradient backpropagation through the score network, or are restricted to linear measurement models.
  In this work, we propose Restart for Posterior Sampling (RePS), a general and efficient framework for solving both linear and non-linear inverse problems using pre-trained diffusion models. RePS builds on the idea of restart-based sampling, previously shown to improve sample quality in unconditional diffusion, and extends it to posterior inference. Our method employs a conditioned ODE applicable to any differentiable measurement model and introduces a simplified restart strategy that contracts accumulated approximation errors during sampling. Unlike some of the prior approaches, RePS avoids backpropagation through the score network, substantially reducing computational cost.
  We demonstrate that RePS achieves faster convergence and superior reconstruction quality compared to existing diffusion-based baselines across a range of inverse problems, including both linear and non-linear settings.

TL;DR: Active Slice Discovery framework for identifying systematic error patterns in LLMs using limited manual annotation, with uncertainty-based active learning achieving competitive accuracy using only 2-10% of slice membership information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs exhibit systematic errors on specific data subsets (error slices), but identifying these slices requires extensive manual annotation. The goal is to reduce annotation burden by actively grouping likely error patterns.

Method: Formalized Active Slice Discovery approach using feature representations and active learning algorithms to group errors likely belonging to same slice, with limited annotator verification.

Result: Uncertainty-based active learning algorithms were most effective, achieving competitive accuracy using only 2-10% of available slice membership information, significantly outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: Active Slice Discovery with uncertainty-based active learning provides an efficient approach to identify systematic error patterns in LLMs while minimizing annotation costs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit systematic errors on specific subsets of data, known as error slices. For instance, a slice can correspond to a certain demographic, where a model does poorly in identifying toxic comments regarding that demographic. Identifying error slices is crucial to understanding and improving models, but it is also challenging. An appealing approach to reduce the amount of manual annotation required is to actively group errors that are likely to belong to the same slice, while using limited access to an annotator to verify whether the chosen samples share the same pattern of model mistake. In this paper, we formalize this approach as Active Slice Discovery and explore it empirically on a problem of discovering human-defined slices in toxicity classification. We examine the efficacy of active slice discovery under different choices of feature representations and active learning algorithms. On several slices, we find that uncertainty-based active learning algorithms are most effective, achieving competitive accuracy using 2-10% of the available slice membership information, while significantly outperforming baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PPO for LLMs suffers from instability in multi-turn tasks due to misaligned token-level importance sampling and inaccurate advantage estimates. The paper introduces turn-level importance sampling and clipping-bias correction to stabilize training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPO's performance is unstable and prone to collapse in multi-turn dialogue and reasoning tasks due to two main issues: token-level importance sampling misalignment with turn-level environments, and inaccurate advantage estimates from off-policy samples.

Method: Two stabilization techniques: (1) turn-level importance sampling to align optimization with multi-turn reasoning structure, and (2) clipping-bias correction to normalize gradients by downweighting unreliable off-policy samples. Three variants: Turn-PPO, S-PPO, and ST-PPO.

Result: Experiments on multi-turn search tasks show ST-PPO and S-PPO prevent performance collapses, maintain lower clipping ratios, and achieve higher task performance than standard token-level PPO across QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: Combining turn-level importance sampling with clipping-bias correction provides a practical and scalable solution for stabilizing multi-turn LLM agent training.

Abstract: PPO has been widely adopted for training large language models (LLMs) at the token level in multi-turn dialogue and reasoning tasks. However, its performance is often unstable and prone to collapse. Through empirical analysis, we identify two main sources of instability in this setting: (1)~token-level importance sampling, which is misaligned with the natural granularity of multi-turn environments that have distinct turn-level stages, and (2) inaccurate advantage estimates from off-policy samples, where the critic has not learned to evaluate certain state-action pairs, resulting in high-variance gradients and unstable updates. To address these challenges, we introduce two complementary stabilization techniques: (1) turn-level importance sampling, which aligns optimization with the natural structure of multi-turn reasoning, and (2) clipping-bias correction, which normalizes gradients by downweighting unreliable, highly off-policy samples. Depending on how these components are combined, we obtain three variants: Turn-PPO (turn-level sampling only), S-PPO (clipping-bias correction applied to token-level PPO), and ST-PPO (turn-level sampling combined with clipping-bias correction). In our experiments, we primarily study ST-PPO and S-PPO, which together demonstrate how the two stabilization mechanisms address complementary sources of instability. Experiments on multi-turn search tasks across general QA, multi-hop QA, and medical multiple-choice QA benchmarks show that ST-PPO and S-PPO consistently prevent the performance collapses observed in large-model training, maintain lower clipping ratios throughout optimization, and achieve higher task performance than standard token-level PPO. These results demonstrate that combining turn-level importance sampling with clipping-bias correction provides a practical and scalable solution for stabilizing multi-turn LLM agent training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scarcity of real-world data for rare long-tail events and complex multi-agent interactions in autonomous driving, which are crucial for robust safety validation but difficult to collect naturally.

Method: Integrates conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to learn latent traffic structures from historical data and generate physically consistent base scenarios, then uses LLM as adversarial reasoning engine to parse scene descriptions into loss functions and guide scenario generation across risk levels.

Result: Substantially increases coverage of high-risk and long-tail events, improves consistency between simulated and real-world traffic distributions, and exposes autonomous systems to more challenging interactions than existing methods in CARLA and SMARTS simulations.

Conclusion: Establishes a new pathway for safety validation by enabling principled stress-testing of autonomous systems under rare but consequential events through knowledge-driven scenario generation.

Abstract: Autonomous driving faces critical challenges in rare long-tail events and complex multi-agent interactions, which are scarce in real-world data yet essential for robust safety validation. This paper presents a high-fidelity scenario generation framework that integrates a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with a large language model (LLM). The CVAE encodes historical trajectories and map information from large-scale naturalistic datasets to learn latent traffic structures, enabling the generation of physically consistent base scenarios. Building on this, the LLM acts as an adversarial reasoning engine, parsing unstructured scene descriptions into domain-specific loss functions and dynamically guiding scenario generation across varying risk levels. This knowledge-driven optimization balances realism with controllability, ensuring that generated scenarios remain both plausible and risk-sensitive. Extensive experiments in CARLA and SMARTS demonstrate that our framework substantially increases the coverage of high-risk and long-tail events, improves consistency between simulated and real-world traffic distributions, and exposes autonomous driving systems to interactions that are significantly more challenging than those produced by existing rule- or data-driven methods. These results establish a new pathway for safety validation, enabling principled stress-testing of autonomous systems under rare but consequential events.

*Thomas Norrenbrock,Timo Kaiser,Sovan Biswas,Neslihan Kose,Ramesh Manuvinakurike,Bodo Rosenhahn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CHiQPM is a globally interpretable model that provides comprehensive hierarchical explanations while maintaining 99% accuracy of non-interpretable models, with built-in conformal prediction capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop trustworthy AI for safety-critical domains by creating models with both global interpretability and detailed local explanations to support human experts during inference.

Method: Proposes Calibrated Hierarchical QPM (CHiQPM) which uses contrastive explanations for majority classes and hierarchical explanations that mimic human reasoning, with traversable hierarchical structure for interpretable conformal prediction.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy as point predictor (maintaining 99% accuracy of non-interpretable models), provides competitively efficient calibrated set predictions, and offers interpretable predictions of coherent sets through hierarchical explanations.

Conclusion: CHiQPM demonstrates that interpretability can be incorporated without sacrificing accuracy, providing comprehensive global and local interpretability that enables human-AI complementarity through hierarchical reasoning similar to human cognition.

Abstract: Globally interpretable models are a promising approach for trustworthy AI in safety-critical domains. Alongside global explanations, detailed local explanations are a crucial complement to effectively support human experts during inference. This work proposes the Calibrated Hierarchical QPM (CHiQPM) which offers uniquely comprehensive global and local interpretability, paving the way for human-AI complementarity. CHiQPM achieves superior global interpretability by contrastively explaining the majority of classes and offers novel hierarchical explanations that are more similar to how humans reason and can be traversed to offer a built-in interpretable Conformal prediction (CP) method. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that CHiQPM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy as a point predictor, maintaining 99% accuracy of non-interpretable models. This demonstrates a substantial improvement, where interpretability is incorporated without sacrificing overall accuracy. Furthermore, its calibrated set prediction is competitively efficient to other CP methods, while providing interpretable predictions of coherent sets along its hierarchical explanation.

*Rio Alexa Fear,Payel Mukhopadhyay,Michael McCabe,Alberto Bietti,Miles Cranmer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Physics foundation models develop internal representations of physical concepts that can be manipulated to causally control model behavior, suggesting they learn generalized physical principles rather than superficial patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether the phenomenon of learnable internal representations and steerable behavior observed in language models extends to scientific foundation models trained on physical simulation data.

Method: Extracted activation vectors from a physics model during forward passes, computed 'delta' representations between different physical regimes as concept directions, and injected these directions back into the model during inference.

Result: Successfully demonstrated causal control over physical behaviors by steering model predictions, such as inducing or removing specific physical features from simulations.

Conclusion: Scientific foundation models learn generalized representations of physical principles, opening new avenues for understanding and controlling AI models for scientific discovery.

Abstract: Recent advances in mechanistic interpretability have revealed that large language models (LLMs) develop internal representations corresponding not only to concrete entities but also distinct, human-understandable abstract concepts and behaviour. Moreover, these hidden features can be directly manipulated to steer model behaviour. However, it remains an open question whether this phenomenon is unique to models trained on inherently structured data (ie. language, images) or if it is a general property of foundation models. In this work, we investigate the internal representations of a large physics-focused foundation model. Inspired by recent work identifying single directions in activation space for complex behaviours in LLMs, we extract activation vectors from the model during forward passes over simulation datasets for different physical regimes. We then compute "delta" representations between the two regimes. These delta tensors act as concept directions in activation space, encoding specific physical features. By injecting these concept directions back into the model during inference, we can steer its predictions, demonstrating causal control over physical behaviours, such as inducing or removing some particular physical feature from a simulation. These results suggest that scientific foundation models learn generalised representations of physical principles. They do not merely rely on superficial correlations and patterns in the simulations. Our findings open new avenues for understanding and controlling scientific foundation models and has implications for AI-enabled scientific discovery.

### [161] [Conformal Safety Monitoring for Flight Testing: A Case Study in Data-Driven Safety Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20811)
*Aaron O. Feldman,D. Isaiah Harp,Joseph Duncan,Mac Schwager*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A data-driven approach for runtime safety monitoring in flight testing that uses stochastic trajectory simulation and conformal prediction to provide pilots with preemptive criteria for aborting maneuvers before safety violations occur.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flight testing involves inherent safety risks due to uncertain aircraft parameters, requiring pilots to have clear preemptive criteria to abort maneuvers before safety violations happen unexpectedly.

Method: Three components: 1) Model to predict future state from recent observations, 2) Nearest neighbor model to classify safety of predicted state, 3) Classifier calibration via conformal prediction using offline stochastic trajectory simulation.

Result: The method reliably identifies unsafe scenarios, matches theoretical guarantees, and outperforms baseline approaches in preemptive classification of risk on a flight dynamics model with uncertain parameters.

Conclusion: The approach provides a broadly-applicable data-driven solution for runtime safety monitoring that can preemptively classify risk and help prevent safety violations in uncertain environments like flight testing.

Abstract: We develop a data-driven approach for runtime safety monitoring in flight testing, where pilots perform maneuvers on aircraft with uncertain parameters. Because safety violations can arise unexpectedly as a result of these uncertainties, pilots need clear, preemptive criteria to abort the maneuver in advance of safety violation. To solve this problem, we use offline stochastic trajectory simulation to learn a calibrated statistical model of the short-term safety risk facing pilots. We use flight testing as a motivating example for data-driven learning/monitoring of safety due to its inherent safety risk, uncertainty, and human-interaction. However, our approach consists of three broadly-applicable components: a model to predict future state from recent observations, a nearest neighbor model to classify the safety of the predicted state, and classifier calibration via conformal prediction. We evaluate our method on a flight dynamics model with uncertain parameters, demonstrating its ability to reliably identify unsafe scenarios, match theoretical guarantees, and outperform baseline approaches in preemptive classification of risk.

*Nicholas Pellegrino,David Szczecina,Paul W. Fieguth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Untrained neural networks exhibit Initial Guessing Bias, favoring few classes after random initialization. Loss functions like Blurry and Piecewise-zero loss designed for label error robustness struggle with this bias, affecting early training dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how Initial Guessing Bias in untrained neural networks affects early training dynamics and how different loss functions interact with this bias, particularly those designed for robustness to label errors.

Method: Analysis of how untrained large neural networks behave after random initialization, examining the impact of Initial Guessing Bias on early training dynamics and testing different loss functions including Blurry and Piecewise-zero loss.

Result: Initial Guessing Bias causes networks to favor small subsets of classes, assigning high probabilities to few classes and near-zero to others. Loss functions designed for label error robustness (Blurry and Piecewise-zero) become ineffective at steering training direction when exposed to this initial bias.

Conclusion: The choice of loss function significantly impacts early training phases, and careful consideration of how Initial Guessing Bias interacts with training components is necessary for effective neural network training.

Abstract: Untrained large neural networks, just after random initialization, tend to favour a small subset of classes, assigning high predicted probabilities to these few classes and approximately zero probability to all others. This bias, termed Initial Guessing Bias, affects the early training dynamics, when the model is fitting to the coarse structure of the data. The choice of loss function against which to train the model has a large impact on how these early dynamics play out. Two recent loss functions, Blurry and Piecewise-zero loss, were designed for robustness to label errors but can become unable to steer the direction of training when exposed to this initial bias. Results indicate that the choice of loss function has a dramatic effect on the early phase training of networks, and highlights the need for careful consideration of how Initial Guessing Bias may interact with various components of the training scheme.

*Reza Mansouri,Dustin Kempton,Pete Riley,Rafal Angryk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First autoregressive machine learning surrogate for solar wind velocity using Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) that iteratively propagates solutions outward, outperforming traditional MHD models and HUX surrogate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D magnetohydrodynamic models for solar wind prediction are computationally expensive, limiting rapid exploration of boundary condition uncertainties for space weather forecasting.

Method: Uses Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) with autoregressive approach - predicts limited radial range and iteratively propagates solution outward to improve accuracy in distant regions.

Result: SFNO demonstrates superior or comparable performance to numerical HUX surrogate while providing flexible, trainable, data-driven alternative for solar wind modeling.

Conclusion: Establishes novel methodology for high-fidelity solar wind modeling with improved computational efficiency and accuracy compared to traditional approaches.

Abstract: The solar wind, a continuous outflow of charged particles from the Sun's corona, shapes the heliosphere and impacts space systems near Earth. Accurate prediction of features such as high-speed streams and coronal mass ejections is critical for space weather forecasting, but traditional three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models are computationally expensive, limiting rapid exploration of boundary condition uncertainties. We introduce the first autoregressive machine learning surrogate for steady-state solar wind radial velocity using the Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO). By predicting a limited radial range and iteratively propagating the solution outward, the model improves accuracy in distant regions compared to a single-step approach. Compared with the numerical HUX surrogate, SFNO demonstrates superior or comparable performance while providing a flexible, trainable, and data-driven alternative, establishing a novel methodology for high-fidelity solar wind modeling.

### [164] [Primal: A Unified Deterministic Framework for Quasi-Orthogonal Hashing and Manifold Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20839)
*Vladimer Khasia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Primal is a deterministic feature mapping framework using prime square roots to create robust vector representations with two variants: StaticPrime for temporal encodings and DynamicPrime for tunable projections that can function as both kernel maps and one-way hashes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create deterministic alternatives to stochastic projections like Random Fourier Features by leveraging number-theoretic properties of prime square roots for more robust and tunable vector representations.

Method: Uses prime square roots' Besicovitch property to create irrational frequency modulations. Two variants: StaticPrime generates temporal position encodings, DynamicPrime provides tunable projections via scaling parameter σ that can operate in low-frequency (isometric kernel map) or high-frequency (chaotic hash) regimes.

Result: Superior orthogonality retention and distribution tightness compared to normalized Gaussian baselines, with empirical performance approaching Welch bound for quasi-orthogonality.

Conclusion: Primal provides a computationally efficient, mathematically rigorous deterministic alternative to random matrix projections, unifying disparate mathematical utility classes through a single tunable framework.

Abstract: We present Primal, a deterministic feature mapping framework that harnesses the number-theoretic independence of prime square roots to construct robust, tunable vector representations. Diverging from standard stochastic projections (e.g., Random Fourier Features), our method exploits the Besicovitch property to create irrational frequency modulations that guarantee infinite non-repeating phase trajectories. We formalize two distinct algorithmic variants: (1) StaticPrime, a sequence generation method that produces temporal position encodings empirically approaching the theoretical Welch bound for quasi-orthogonality; and (2) DynamicPrime, a tunable projection layer for input-dependent feature mapping. A central novelty of the dynamic framework is its ability to unify two disparate mathematical utility classes through a single scaling parameter σ. In the low-frequency regime, the method acts as an isometric kernel map, effectively linearizing non-convex geometries (e.g., spirals) to enable high-fidelity signal reconstruction and compressive sensing. Conversely, the high-frequency regime induces chaotic phase wrapping, transforming the projection into a maximum-entropy one-way hash suitable for Hyperdimensional Computing and privacy-preserving Split Learning. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our framework yields superior orthogonality retention and distribution tightness compared to normalized Gaussian baselines, establishing it as a computationally efficient, mathematically rigorous alternative to random matrix projections.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Self-supervised learning pre-training improves robustness to label noise in deep networks without requiring clean labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training deep networks with noisy labels leads to poor generalization and degraded accuracy due to overfitting to label noise, and existing approaches often rely on clean data subsets.

Method: Pre-train feature extractor backbone without labels using self-supervised learning (SimCLR and Barlow Twins), followed by standard supervised training on noisy datasets.

Result: Self-supervised pre-training consistently improves classification accuracy and label-error detection across all noise rates, with performance gap widening as noise increases. Outperforms ImageNet pre-trained models under high noise conditions.

Conclusion: SSL pre-training provides effective noise robustness without requiring clean labeled data, making it particularly valuable for high-noise scenarios.

Abstract: Training deep networks with noisy labels leads to poor generalization and degraded accuracy due to overfitting to label noise. Existing approaches for learning with noisy labels often rely on the availability of a clean subset of data. By pre-training a feature extractor backbone without labels using self-supervised learning (SSL), followed by standard supervised training on the noisy dataset, we can train a more noise robust model without requiring a subset with clean labels. We evaluate the use of SimCLR and Barlow~Twins as SSL methods on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 under synthetic and real world noise. Across all noise rates, self-supervised pre-training consistently improves classification accuracy and enhances downstream label-error detection (F1 and Balanced Accuracy). The performance gap widens as the noise rate increases, demonstrating improved robustness. Notably, our approach achieves comparable results to ImageNet pre-trained models at low noise levels, while substantially outperforming them under high noise conditions.

*Nan Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses state resetting in simulators with latent variables, showing it reduces to conditional distribution selection and developing algorithms for belief-state sampling under sampling-only access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State resetting is fundamental for planning and calibration but challenging in simulators with latent variables, requiring belief-state sampling which raises questions about sampler selection.

Method: Develops a new algorithm and analysis for belief-state selection under sampling-only access, with two formulations: latent state-based and observation-based selection, and analyzes different roll-out methods.

Result: Reveals that observation-based selection may fail under Single-Reset roll-out but works under Repeated-Reset, showing different guarantees for the two formulations.

Conclusion: The paper uncovers a rich landscape of algorithmic choices and theoretical nuances in belief-state selection, highlighting open questions in this seemingly simple problem.

Abstract: State resetting is a fundamental but often overlooked capability of simulators. It supports sample-based planning by allowing resets to previously encountered simulation states, and enables calibration of simulators using real data by resetting to states observed in real-system traces. While often taken for granted, state resetting in complex simulators can be nontrivial: when the simulator comes with latent variables (states), state resetting requires sampling from the posterior over the latent state given the observable history, a.k.a. the belief state (Silver and Veness, 2010). While exact sampling is often infeasible, many approximate belief-state samplers can be constructed, raising the question of how to select among them using only sampling access to the simulator.
  In this paper, we show that this problem reduces to a general conditional distribution-selection task and develop a new algorithm and analysis under sampling-only access. Building on this reduction, the belief-state selection problem admits two different formulations: latent state-based selection, which directly targets the conditional distribution of the latent state, and observation-based selection, which targets the induced distribution over the observation. Interestingly, these formulations differ in how their guarantees interact with the downstream roll-out methods: perhaps surprisingly, observation-based selection may fail under the most natural roll-out method (which we call Single-Reset) but enjoys guarantees under the less conventional alternative (which we call Repeated-Reset). Together with discussion on issues such as distribution shift and the choice of sampling policies, our paper reveals a rich landscape of algorithmic choices, theoretical nuances, and open questions, in this seemingly simple problem.

### [167] [Representation Integrity in Temporal Graph Learning Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20873)
*Elahe Kooshafar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework called "representation integrity" to evaluate dynamic graph embeddings by measuring how closely embedding changes follow actual graph changes, and recommends a validated metric for this purpose.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for dynamic graph learners focus on task-specific scores but don't assess whether embeddings truthfully reflect the evolving network structure over time.

Method: The authors formalize representation integrity, derive a family of indexes to measure embedding-graph alignment, test 42 candidate indexes on three synthetic scenarios (Gradual Merge, Abrupt Move, Periodic Re-wiring), and recommend one validated index.

Result: The recommended metric consistently ranks provably stable models (UASE and IPP) highest, exposes scenario-specific strengths of neural methods, and shows strong positive correlation with link-prediction AUC.

Conclusion: The representation integrity framework provides a task-agnostic, interpretable evaluation tool for dynamic graph representation quality, offering explicit guidance for model selection and future architecture design.

Abstract: Real-world systems ranging from airline routes to cryptocurrency transfers are naturally modelled as dynamic graphs whose topology changes over time. Conventional benchmarks judge dynamic-graph learners by a handful of task-specific scores, yet seldom ask whether the embeddings themselves remain a truthful, interpretable reflection of the evolving network. We formalize this requirement as representation integrity and derive a family of indexes that measure how closely embedding changes follow graph changes. Three synthetic scenarios, Gradual Merge, Abrupt Move, and Periodic Re-wiring, are used to screen forty-two candidate indexes. Based on which we recommend one index that passes all of our theoretical and empirical tests. In particular, this validated metric consistently ranks the provably stable UASE and IPP models highest. We then use this index to do a comparative study on representation integrity of common dynamic graph learning models. This study exposes the scenario-specific strengths of neural methods, and shows a strong positive rank correlation with one-step link-prediction AUC. The proposed integrity framework, therefore, offers a task-agnostic and interpretable evaluation tool for dynamic-graph representation quality, providing more explicit guidance for model selection and future architecture design.

### [168] [Probabilistic Hash Embeddings for Online Learning of Categorical Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20893)
*Aodong Li,Abishek Sankararaman,Balakrishnan Narayanaswamy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Probabilistic Hash Embedding (PHE) for online learning with evolving categorical vocabularies, addressing order sensitivity and forgetting issues in deterministic hash embeddings through Bayesian online learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional feature hashing methods for categorical features are designed for offline settings and suffer from forgetting and sensitivity to arrival order in online learning scenarios with evolving vocabularies.

Method: Probabilistic Hash Embedding (PHE) treats hash embeddings as stochastic variables and applies Bayesian online learning with scalable inference to learn incrementally while handling vocabulary evolution.

Result: PHE demonstrates superior performance in classification, sequence modeling, and recommendation systems while maintaining high memory efficiency (2-4x less memory than one-hot embeddings) and being invariant to item arrival order.

Conclusion: PHE effectively addresses the limitations of deterministic hash embeddings in online settings by providing an adaptive, memory-efficient solution that handles evolving vocabularies without forgetting old items.

Abstract: We study streaming data with categorical features where the vocabulary of categorical feature values is changing and can even grow unboundedly over time. Feature hashing is commonly used as a pre-processing step to map these categorical values into a feature space of fixed size before learning their embeddings. While these methods have been developed and evaluated for offline or batch settings, in this paper we consider online settings. We show that deterministic embeddings are sensitive to the arrival order of categories and suffer from forgetting in online learning, leading to performance deterioration. To mitigate this issue, we propose a probabilistic hash embedding (PHE) model that treats hash embeddings as stochastic and applies Bayesian online learning to learn incrementally from data. Based on the structure of PHE, we derive a scalable inference algorithm to learn model parameters and infer/update the posteriors of hash embeddings and other latent variables. Our algorithm (i) can handle an evolving vocabulary of categorical items, (ii) is adaptive to new items without forgetting old items, (iii) is implementable with a bounded set of parameters that does not grow with the number of distinct observed values on the stream, and (iv) is invariant to the item arrival order. Experiments in classification, sequence modeling, and recommendation systems in online learning setups demonstrate the superior performance of PHE while maintaining high memory efficiency (consumes as low as 2~4 memory of a one-hot embedding table).

*Anil K. Saini,Jose Guadalupe Hernandez,Emily F. Wong,Debanshi Misra,Jason H. Moore*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Evolved sample weights via Genetic Algorithm can achieve better fairness-performance trade-offs than dataset-based or equal weighting methods, with optimization objective choice being crucial.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models trained on real-world data may make biased predictions that negatively impact marginalized communities, requiring methods to mitigate such bias.

Method: Compared three weighting methods: (1) Genetic Algorithm-evolved weights, (2) dataset-characteristic-based weights, (3) equal weights. Used accuracy, AUC, demographic parity difference, and subgroup false negative fairness as evaluation metrics and GA optimization objectives.

Result: Evolved sample weights produced models with better fairness-performance trade-offs than alternative methods. Benefits depended strongly on optimization objectives, with accuracy + demographic parity difference yielding the best results across most datasets.

Conclusion: Genetic Algorithm-based weight evolution can effectively balance fairness and predictive performance, with objective selection being critical for optimal results.

Abstract: Machine learning models trained on real-world data may inadvertently make biased predictions that negatively impact marginalized communities. Reweighting is a method that can mitigate such bias in model predictions by assigning a weight to each data point used during model training. In this paper, we compare three methods for generating these weights: (1) evolving them using a Genetic Algorithm (GA), (2) computing them using only dataset characteristics, and (3) assigning equal weights to all data points. Model performance under each strategy was evaluated using paired predictive and fairness metrics, which also served as optimization objectives for the GA during evolution. Specifically, we used two predictive metrics (accuracy and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) and two fairness metrics (demographic parity difference and subgroup false negative fairness). Using experiments on eleven publicly available datasets (including two medical datasets), we show that evolved sample weights can produce models that achieve better trade-offs between fairness and predictive performance than alternative weighting methods. However, the magnitude of these benefits depends strongly on the choice of optimization objectives. Our experiments reveal that optimizing with accuracy and demographic parity difference metrics yields the largest number of datasets for which evolved weights are significantly better than other weighting strategies in optimizing both objectives.

### [170] [Exploring Time-Step Size in Reinforcement Learning for Sepsis Treatment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20913)
*Yingchuan Sun,Shengpu Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper empirically compares different time-step sizes (1h, 2h, 4h, 8h) in offline RL for sepsis management, finding that finer time-steps (1h, 2h) achieve better performance and stability than the conventional 4-hour setup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL approaches for sepsis management use 4-hour time steps, but concerns exist about whether this coarse granularity distorts patient dynamics and leads to suboptimal policies. The practical impact of time-step size remains unexplored.

Method: Controlled experiments comparing four time-step sizes (1h, 2h, 4h, 8h) using identical offline RL pipeline. Developed action re-mapping methods for fair cross-time-step evaluation and conducted cross-time-step model selection under two policy learning setups.

Result: Performance trends vary across time-step sizes depending on learning setups. Policies learned at finer time-step sizes (1h and 2h) using static behavior policy achieve the overall best performance and stability.

Conclusion: Time-step size is a core design choice in offline RL for healthcare, and evidence supports using alternatives beyond the conventional 4-hour setup, particularly finer time-steps (1h, 2h) for better performance.

Abstract: Existing studies on reinforcement learning (RL) for sepsis management have mostly followed an established problem setup, in which patient data are aggregated into 4-hour time steps. Although concerns have been raised regarding the coarseness of this time-step size, which might distort patient dynamics and lead to suboptimal treatment policies, the extent to which this is a problem in practice remains unexplored. In this work, we conducted empirical experiments for a controlled comparison of four time-step sizes ($Δt\!=\!1,2,4,8$ h) on this domain, following an identical offline RL pipeline. To enable a fair comparison across time-step sizes, we designed action re-mapping methods that allow for evaluation of policies on datasets with different time-step sizes, and conducted cross-$Δt$ model selections under two policy learning setups. Our goal was to quantify how time-step size influences state representation learning, behavior cloning, policy training, and off-policy evaluation. Our results show that performance trends across $Δt$ vary as learning setups change, while policies learned at finer time-step sizes ($Δt = 1$ h and $2$ h) using a static behavior policy achieve the overall best performance and stability. Our work highlights time-step size as a core design choice in offline RL for healthcare and provides evidence supporting alternatives beyond the conventional 4-hour setup.

*Vitoria Barin-Pacela,Kartik Ahuja,Simon Lacoste-Julien,Pascal Vincent*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Cliff, a method for unsupervised disentanglement that encourages axis-aligned discontinuities in factor densities to recover quantized latent factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent theory shows quantized factors are identifiable under diffeomorphisms if quantization thresholds create axis-aligned density discontinuities, but translating this principle into practical criteria remains challenging.

Method: Develop a criterion that encourages axis-aligned discontinuities (cliffs) in factor densities, ensuring cliff locations along one factor are independent of other factors' values.

Result: Cliff outperforms all baselines on disentanglement benchmarks, demonstrating superior effectiveness in unsupervised disentanglement.

Conclusion: The method successfully translates theoretical identifiability principles into practical unsupervised disentanglement by leveraging axis-aligned density discontinuities.

Abstract: Recent theoretical work established the unsupervised identifiability of quantized factors under any diffeomorphism. The theory assumes that quantization thresholds correspond to axis-aligned discontinuities in the probability density of the latent factors. By constraining a learned map to have a density with axis-aligned discontinuities, we can recover the quantization of the factors. However, translating this high-level principle into an effective practical criterion remains challenging, especially under nonlinear maps. Here, we develop a criterion for unsupervised disentanglement by encouraging axis-aligned discontinuities. Discontinuities manifest as sharp changes in the estimated density of factors and form what we call cliffs. Following the definition of independent discontinuities from the theory, we encourage the location of the cliffs along a factor to be independent of the values of the other factors. We show that our method, Cliff, outperforms the baselines on all disentanglement benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in unsupervised disentanglement.

*Yaw Osei Adjei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper compares two BEC detection approaches: DistilBERT for high accuracy with GPU infrastructure, and CatBoost for low-latency edge deployment, both achieving >99.96% ROI through cost-sensitive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BEC causes $2.9B annual losses with extreme cost asymmetry (FN costs 5,480x more than FP), requiring detection systems that minimize false negatives to prevent financial damage.

Method: Two detection streams: Forensic Psycholinguistic Stream using CatBoost for psycholinguistic analysis, and Semantic Stream using DistilBERT for contextual language understanding. Evaluated on adversarially poisoned dataset (N=7,990) via Black Hole protocol.

Result: DistilBERT achieved perfect detection (AUC=1.0000, F1=0.9981) with 7.403ms latency; CatBoost achieved competitive detection (AUC=0.9905, F1=0.9486) with 8.4x lower latency (0.885ms) and minimal resource usage.

Conclusion: DistilBERT is optimal for GPU-enabled environments requiring maximum accuracy, while CatBoost is preferable for edge/cost-sensitive deployments. Both approaches achieve >99.96% ROI by reducing false negatives and associated financial losses.

Abstract: Business Email Compromise (BEC) is a sophisticated social engineering threat that manipulates organizational hierarchies and exploits psychological vulnerabilities, leading to significant financial damage. According to the 2024 FBI Internet Crime Report, BEC accounts for over $2.9 billion in annual adjusted losses, presenting significant economic asymmetry: the cost of a False Negative (fraud loss) exceeds the cost of a False Positive (manual review) by orders of magnitude (approximately 1 to 5,480).
  This paper examines two detection paradigms for BEC: the Forensic Psycholinguistic Stream, which utilizes CatBoost to analyze psycholinguistic cues with high interpretability and low latency, and the Semantic Stream, which employs DistilBERT for deep learning-based contextual language understanding, offering superior accuracy at higher computational cost. We evaluated DistilBERT on an adversarially poisoned dataset (N = 7,990) generated via our Black Hole protocol, benchmarked on Tesla T4 GPU infrastructure, achieving superior detection (AUC = 1.0000, F1 = 0.9981) with acceptable real-time latency (7.403 milliseconds). CatBoost achieves competitive detection (AUC = 0.9905, F1 = 0.9486) at 8.4x lower latency (0.885 milliseconds), consuming negligible computational resources. For organizations with GPU infrastructure, DistilBERT offers superior accuracy. CatBoost is preferable for edge deployments or cost-sensitive environments due to comparable security and lower operational costs. Both approaches demonstrate return on investment exceeding 99.96% when optimized through cost-sensitive learning, by significantly reducing false negatives and associated financial losses.

*Akansha Kalra,Soumil Datta,Ethan Gilmore,Duc La,Guanhong Tao,Daniel S. Brown*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First analysis of clean-label backdoor attacks on Behavior Cloning policies, showing that even minimally poisoned datasets create vulnerabilities where policies maintain high task performance but are highly susceptible to trigger attacks during deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As Behavior Cloning policies are increasingly deployed in real-world systems, understanding their robustness and vulnerabilities to backdoor attacks is crucial for ensuring safety and reliability.

Method: Inject visual triggers into demonstration datasets to create spurious correlations, evaluate vulnerability scaling with poisoned data fraction and trigger strength, and introduce novel entropy-based test-time trigger attacks targeting critical states.

Result: BC policies trained on minimally poisoned datasets exhibit deceptively high task performance but are highly vulnerable to backdoor trigger attacks during deployment, with the entropy-based attack substantially degrading performance.

Conclusion: There is an urgent need for more research into BC policy robustness, especially as large-scale datasets are used to train real-world cyber-physical systems, due to the deceptive nature of these vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) is a popular framework for training sequential decision policies from expert demonstrations via supervised learning. As these policies are increasingly being deployed in the real world, their robustness and potential vulnerabilities are an important concern. In this work, we perform the first analysis of the efficacy of clean-label backdoor attacks on BC policies. Our backdoor attacks poison a dataset of demonstrations by injecting a visual trigger to create a spurious correlation that can be exploited at test time. We evaluate how policy vulnerability scales with the fraction of poisoned data, the strength of the trigger, and the trigger type. We also introduce a novel entropy-based test-time trigger attack that substantially degrades policy performance by identifying critical states where test-time triggering of the backdoor is expected to be most effective at degrading performance. We empirically demonstrate that BC policies trained on even minimally poisoned datasets exhibit deceptively high, near-baseline task performance despite being highly vulnerable to backdoor trigger attacks during deployment. Our results underscore the urgent need for more research into the robustness of BC policies, particularly as large-scale datasets are increasingly used to train policies for real-world cyber-physical systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SGA-ACR framework addresses LLM planning-execution misalignment in RL by integrating environment-specific subgoal graphs with multi-LLM planning pipeline for executable subgoals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have strong planning capabilities but suffer from poor planning-execution alignment due to infeasible subgoals and overconfident self-verification, limiting practical RL utility.

Method: Proposes SGA-ACR framework with environment-specific subgoal graph, structured entity knowledge, multi-LLM pipeline separating generation/critique/refinement, and subgoal tracker for execution monitoring.

Result: Experimental results on 22 diverse tasks in open-world game 'Crafter' demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses LLM planning-execution misalignment by producing executable and verifiable subgoals through structured multi-LLM planning and environment-specific knowledge integration.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer strong high-level planning capabilities for reinforcement learning (RL) by decomposing tasks into subgoals. However, their practical utility is limited by poor planning-execution alignment, which reflects a critical gap between abstract plans and actionable, environment-compatible behaviors. This misalignment arises from two interrelated limitations: (1) LLMs often produce subgoals that are semantically plausible but infeasible or irrelevant in the target environment due to insufficient grounding in environment-specific knowledge, and (2) single-LLM planning conflates generation with self-verification, resulting in overconfident yet unreliable subgoals that frequently fail during execution. To address these challenges, we propose Subgoal Graph-Augmented Actor-Critic-Refiner (SGA-ACR), a framework that integrates an environment-specific subgoal graph and structured entity knowledge with a multi-LLM planning pipeline that explicitly separates generation, critique, and refinement to produce executable and verifiable subgoals. A subgoal tracker further monitors execution progress, provides auxiliary rewards, and adaptively updates the subgoal graph to maintain alignment between plans and actions. Experimental results on 22 diverse tasks in the open-world game "Crafter" demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

*Jiaoyang Li,Jun Fang,Tianhao Gao,Xiaohui Zhang,Zhiyuan Liu,Chao Liu,Pengzhang Liu,Qixia Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FANoise is a feature-adaptive noise injection strategy for multimodal representation learning that dynamically adjusts noise based on contrastive learning dynamics, improving performance across various VLM models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing noise injection methods in representation learning rely on heuristic or static noise, failing to account for the dynamic nature of feature distributions during training, which limits their effectiveness.

Method: Proposed FANoise - a feature-adaptive noise injection strategy that leverages the dynamics of contrastive learning (using InfoNCE loss) to mitigate negative noise impacts while preserving benefits, systematically studying noise from gradient-based and feature distribution perspectives.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show FANoise consistently improves overall performance on multimodal tasks across various base VLM models, demonstrating the effectiveness of adaptive noise injection.

Conclusion: Feature-adaptive noise injection through FANoise provides a theoretically grounded framework that enhances representation learning by dynamically adjusting noise based on training dynamics, leading to improved multimodal task performance.

Abstract: Representation learning is fundamental to modern machine learning, powering applications such as text retrieval and multimodal understanding. However, learning robust and generalizable representations remains challenging. While prior work has demonstrated that active noise injection, a form of data augmentation, can enhance encoding performance, most existing methods rely on heuristic or static noise, overlooking the dynamic nature of feature distributions during training. In this work, we systematically study the role of noise in representation learning from both gradient-based and feature distribution perspectives, using InfoNCE loss as a representative example. Focusing on multimodal representation learning, we propose FANoise, a novel feature-adaptive noise injection strategy. By leveraging the dynamics of contrastive learning, FANoise effectively mitigates the negative impacts of noise while preserving its benefits. Under this theoretically grounded framework, comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FANoise consistently improves overall performance on multimodal tasks across various base VLM models.

*Constantinos Daskalakis,Vardis Kandiros,Rui Yao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a unified analysis of Maximum Pseudo-Likelihood Estimator (MPLE) for Ising models, achieving polynomial-time estimation in Total Variation distance for two general classes: models with bounded operator norm satisfying MLSI, and models with bounded infinity norm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work has made progress on Ising model estimation in specific settings (trees, Gaussian interactions, bounded eigenvalues), but no unified framework existed for polynomial-time estimation in TV distance across general classes.

Method: Uses Maximum Pseudo-Likelihood Estimator (MPLE) with analysis employing tensorization inequalities, measure decompositions, and concentration bounds for two general classes of Ising models.

Result: Provides polynomial-time algorithms with optimal or near-optimal sample complexity guarantees for Ising model estimation in TV distance across various settings.

Conclusion: The unified framework successfully addresses the computational and statistical efficiency challenge for Ising model estimation, covering previously studied special cases and extending to more general model classes.

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating Ising models over $n$ variables in Total Variation (TV) distance, given $l$ independent samples from the model. While the statistical complexity of the problem is well-understood [DMR20], identifying computationally and statistically efficient algorithms has been challenging. In particular, remarkable progress has occurred in several settings, such as when the underlying graph is a tree [DP21, BGPV21], when the entries of the interaction matrix follow a Gaussian distribution [GM24, CK24], or when the bulk of its eigenvalues lie in a small interval [AJK+24, KLV24], but no unified framework for polynomial-time estimation in TV exists so far. Our main contribution is a unified analysis of the Maximum Pseudo-Likelihood Estimator (MPLE) for two general classes of Ising models. The first class includes models that have bounded operator norm and satisfy the Modified Log-Sobolev Inequality (MLSI), a functional inequality that was introduced to study the convergence of the associated Glauber dynamics to stationarity. In the second class of models, the interaction matrix has bounded infinity norm (or bounded width), which is the most common assumption in the literature for structure learning of Ising models. We show how our general results for these classes yield polynomial-time algorithms and optimal or near-optimal sample complexity guarantees in a variety of settings. Our proofs employ a variety of tools from tensorization inequalities to measure decompositions and concentration bounds.

*Sid Bharthulwar,Stone Tao,Hao Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Staggered resets reduce harmful nonstationarity in parallel RL training by initializing environments at varied points in the task horizon, improving sample efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard synchronous resets in massively parallel GPU environments introduce harmful nonstationarity that skews learning signals and destabilizes training, especially with high update-to-data ratios.

Method: Introduce staggered resets where environments are initialized and reset at varied points within the task horizon, creating training batches with greater temporal diversity.

Result: Significantly higher sample efficiency, faster wall-clock convergence, stronger final performance in challenging robotics environments, and better scaling with more parallel environments.

Conclusion: Staggered resets are a simple yet effective technique that reduces nonstationarity in parallel RL training, leading to improved learning stability and performance.

Abstract: Massively parallel GPU simulation environments have accelerated reinforcement learning (RL) research by enabling fast data collection for on-policy RL algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). To maximize throughput, it is common to use short rollouts per policy update, increasing the update-to-data (UTD) ra- tio. However, we find that, in this setting, standard synchronous resets introduce harmful nonstationarity, skewing the learning signal and destabilizing training. We introduce staggered resets, a simple yet effective technique where environments are initialized and reset at varied points within the task horizon. This yields training batches with greater temporal diversity, reducing the nonstationarity induced by synchronized rollouts. We characterize dimensions along which RL environments can benefit significantly from staggered resets through illustrative toy environ- ments. We then apply this technique to challenging high-dimensional robotics environments, achieving significantly higher sample efficiency, faster wall-clock convergence, and stronger final performance. Finally, this technique scales better with more parallel environments compared to naive synchronized rollouts.

*Liangzu Peng,Aditya Chattopadhyay,Luca Zancato,Elvis Nunez,Wei Xia,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gated KalmaNet (GKA) is a linear state-space model layer that solves online ridge regression for full-past prediction while maintaining SSM efficiency, using Kalman Filter-inspired iterative solving with adaptive regularization and Chebyshev Iteration for numerical stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear state-space models are efficient but maintain only lossy summaries of the past, leading to inferior performance in recall-oriented tasks. The goal is to bridge this gap by accounting for the full past while maintaining efficiency.

Method: GKA solves online ridge regression iteratively using Kalman Filter inspiration. Key innovations include: adaptive regularization with input-dependent gating for numerical stability, Chebyshev Iteration for stable low-precision solving, and hardware-aware chunk-wise implementation with custom kernels.

Result: GKA outperforms existing SSM layers (Mamba2, GLA, Gated DeltaNet) on short-context tasks and achieves >10% relative improvement on long-context tasks up to 128k tokens, particularly excelling at RAG and LongQA tasks.

Conclusion: GKA successfully bridges the performance gap between efficient SSMs and full-context models while maintaining constant memory and linear compute, demonstrating strong capabilities in both short and long-context language understanding tasks.

Abstract: As efficient alternatives to softmax Attention, linear state-space models (SSMs) achieve constant memory and linear compute, but maintain only a lossy, fading summary of the past, often leading to inferior performance in recall oriented tasks. We propose Gated KalmaNet (GKA), a layer that reduces this gap by accounting for the full past when predicting the next token, while maintaining SSM-style efficiency. GKA achieves this by solving an online ridge regression problem at test time, with constant memory and linear compute cost in the sequence length. Drawing inspiration from the Kalman Filter, we iteratively solve the online ridge regression problem. However, a critical insight is that standard Kalman filter equations are numerically unstable in low-precision environments (like bfloat16) and difficult to parallelize in modern hardware. We address both challenges through two key innovations: (1) an adaptive regularization strategy with input-dependent gating that controls the condition number of the ridge regression, ensuring numerical stability while balancing memory retention. And (2) the use of Chebyshev Iteration instead of other conventional iterative solvers, which we demonstrate to be more stable in low-precision settings. To further improve scalability, we develop a hardware-aware chunk-wise implementation of Chebyshev Iteration along with custom kernels for backpropagating through our adaptive regularization and gating mechanisms. Empirically, GKA shows strong language understanding capabilites on short-context tasks outperforming existing SSM layers (like Mamba2, GLA and Gated DeltaNet). On long-context, GKA excels at real-world RAG and LongQA tasks up to 128k tokens, achieving more than $10$% relative improvement over other fading memory baselines.

*Taehoon Kang,Taeyong Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An autoregressive conditional GAN model for probabilistic wildfire spread prediction that outperforms conventional deep learning methods in accuracy and boundary delineation while capturing nonlinear dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate change has intensified wildfires, but physics-based simulators are too slow for real-time use and existing deep learning models produce overly smooth predictions that miss complex fire dynamics.

Method: Autoregressive conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) that learns sequential state transitions for probabilistic wildfire spread prediction.

Result: The CGAN-based model outperforms conventional deep learning models in both overall predictive accuracy and boundary delineation of fire perimeters, capturing strong nonlinearity and uncertainty.

Conclusion: The autoregressive CGAN framework enhances accuracy and physical interpretability of wildfire spread prediction, providing a foundation for time-sensitive response and evacuation planning.

Abstract: Climate change has intensified the frequency and severity of wildfires, making rapid and accurate prediction of fire spread essential for effective mitigation and response. Physics-based simulators such as FARSITE offer high-fidelity predictions but are computationally intensive, limiting their applicability in real-time decision-making, while existing deep learning models often yield overly smooth predictions that fail to capture the complex, nonlinear dynamics of wildfire propagation. This study proposes an autoregressive conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) for probabilistic wildfire spread prediction. By formulating the prediction task as an autoregressive problem, the model learns sequential state transitions, ensuring long-term prediction stability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CGAN-based model outperforms conventional deep learning models in both overall predictive accuracy and boundary delineation of fire perimeters. These results demonstrate that adversarial learning allows the model to capture the strong nonlinearity and uncertainty of wildfire spread, instead of simply fitting the pixel average. Furthermore, the autoregressive framework facilitates systematic temporal forecasting of wildfire evolution. The proposed CGAN-based autoregressive framework enhances both the accuracy and physical interpretability of wildfire spread prediction, offering a promising foundation for time-sensitive response and evacuation planning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temporal distribution shift erodes recommender system accuracy, and existing approaches like invariant learning and self-supervised learning suffer from unstable temporal generalization, representation collapse, or inefficient data utilization.

Method: Proposes ELBO_TDS framework that: 1) identifies shifting factors through statistical analysis and designs data augmentation strategy, 2) models temporal recommendation using causal graph and derives self-supervised variational objective based on causal structure.

Result: Achieves superior temporal generalization with 2.33% uplift in GMV per user, successfully deployed in Shopee Product Search.

Conclusion: ELBO_TDS effectively addresses temporal distribution shift through causal modeling and data augmentation, providing a practical solution for industry-scale incremental learning pipelines.

Abstract: Temporal distribution shift (TDS) erodes the long-term accuracy of recommender systems, yet industrial practice still relies on periodic incremental training, which struggles to capture both stable and transient patterns. Existing approaches such as invariant learning and self-supervised learning offer partial solutions but often suffer from unstable temporal generalization, representation collapse, or inefficient data utilization. To address these limitations, we propose ELBO$_\text{TDS}$, a probabilistic framework that integrates seamlessly into industry-scale incremental learning pipelines. First, we identify key shifting factors through statistical analysis of real-world production data and design a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy that resamples these time-varying factors to extend the training support. Second, to harness the benefits of this extended distribution while preventing representation collapse, we model the temporal recommendation scenario using a causal graph and derive a self-supervised variational objective, ELBO$_\text{TDS}$, grounded in the causal structure. Extensive experiments supported by both theoretical and empirical analysis demonstrate that our method achieves superior temporal generalization, yielding a 2.33\% uplift in GMV per user and has been successfully deployed in Shopee Product Search.

Method: Developed AI model using Multi-Head Attention Transformers to analyze historical multivariate time-series data from birth, using 780,000 records from 19,000 cows across 7 Australian farms.

Result: Model achieved 83% determination coefficient in predicting herd life, demonstrating strong predictive performance across multiple farms.

Conclusion: The AI-driven approach shows practical potential for dairy herd management by enabling more informed decisions about cow longevity and resilience.

Abstract: Dairy farmers should decide to keep or cull a cow based on an objective assessment of her likely performance in the herd. For this purpose, farmers need to identify more resilient cows, which can cope better with farm conditions and complete more lactations. This decision-making process is inherently complex, with significant environmental and economic implications. In this study, we develop an AI-driven model to predict cow longevity using historical multivariate time-series data recorded from birth. Leveraging advanced AI techniques, specifically Multi-Head Attention Transformers, we analysed approximately 780,000 records from 19,000 unique cows across 7 farms in Australia. The results demonstrate that our model achieves an overall determination coefficient of 83% in predicting herd life across the studied farms, highlighting its potential for practical application in dairy herd management.

Abstract: Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) is a core technology for future wireless communication systems, enabling the identification of modulation schemes without prior knowledge. This capability is essential for applications in cognitive radio, spectrum monitoring, and intelligent communication networks. We propose an AMC system based on a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture, integrated with a Software Defined Radio (SDR) platform. The proposed architecture leverages CNNs for spatial feature extraction and LSTMs for capturing temporal dependencies, enabling efficient handling of complex, time-varying communication signals. The system's practical ability was demonstrated by identifying over-the-air (OTA) signals from a custom-built FM transmitter alongside other modulation schemes. The system was trained on a hybrid dataset combining the RadioML2018 dataset with a custom-generated dataset, featuring samples at Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) from 0 to 30dB. System performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC). The optimized model achieved 93.48% accuracy, 93.53% precision, 93.48% recall, and an F1 score of 93.45%. The AUC-ROC analysis confirmed the model's discriminative power, even in noisy conditions. This paper's experimental results validate the effectiveness of the hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture for AMC, suggesting its potential application in adaptive spectrum management and advanced cognitive radio systems.

Conclusion: FedAPA effectively addresses data heterogeneity in federated Wi-Fi sensing through adaptive prototype aggregation and hybrid learning objectives, enabling practical large-scale deployment with improved performance and communication efficiency.

Abstract: Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI)-based sensing provides a non-invasive, device-free approach for tasks such as human activity recognition and crowd counting, but large-scale deployment is hindered by the need for extensive site-specific training data. Federated learning (FL) offers a way to avoid raw data sharing but is challenged by heterogeneous sensing data and device resources. This paper proposes FedAPA, a collaborative Wi-Fi CSI-based sensing algorithm that uses adaptive prototype aggregation (APA) strategy to assign similarity-based weights to peer prototypes, enabling adaptive client contributions and yielding a personalized global prototype for each client instead of a fixed-weight aggregation. During local training, we adopt a hybrid objective that combines classification learning with representation contrastive learning to align local and global knowledge. We provide a convergence analysis of FedAPA and evaluate it in a real-world distributed Wi-Fi crowd counting scenario with six environments and up to 20 people. The results show that our method outperform multiple baselines in terms of accuracy, F1 score, mean absolute error (MAE), and communication overhead, with FedAPA achieving at least a 9.65% increase in accuracy, a 9% gain in F1 score, a 0.29 reduction in MAE, and a 95.94% reduction in communication overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard fine-tuning approaches like SFT and RLHF exhibit a safety-capability trade-off where improved task performance degrades safety alignment, even on benign datasets. The safety implications of the emerging RLVR approach remain unexplored.

Method: Comprehensive theoretical analysis deriving upper bounds on safety drift under KL-constrained optimization, plus extensive empirical experiments across five adversarial safety benchmarks with ablation studies on optimization algorithms, model scale, and task domains.

Result: Theoretical proofs show conditions where safety degradation is eliminated. Empirical results demonstrate RLVR can simultaneously enhance reasoning capabilities while maintaining or improving safety guardrails across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: RLVR challenges the prevailing assumption of an inevitable safety-capability trade-off and establishes that specific training methodologies can achieve both objectives simultaneously, providing insights for safe deployment of reasoning-capable LLMs.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for downstream tasks typically exhibit a fundamental safety-capability tradeoff, where improving task performance degrades safety alignment even on benign datasets. This degradation persists across standard approaches including supervised finetuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). While reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising alternative that optimizes models on objectively measurable tasks, its safety implications remain unexplored. We present the first comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis of safety properties in RLVR. Theoretically, we derive upper bounds on safety drift under KL-constrained optimization and prove conditions under which safety degradation is eliminated. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments across five adversarial safety benchmarks, demonstrating that RLVR can simultaneously enhance reasoning capabilities while maintaining or improving safety guardrails. Our comprehensive ablation studies examine the effects of optimization algorithms, model scale, and task domains. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption of an inevitable safety capability trade-off, and establish that a specific training methodology can achieve both objectives simultaneously, providing insights for the safe deployment of reasoning-capable LLMs.

TL;DR: Temporal Diffusion Planner (TDP) improves decision efficiency in diffusion planning by distributing denoising steps across time, reducing computational overhead while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous diffusion planning methods generate new plans at each time step, causing significant computational overhead, lower decision frequencies, and potential performance issues from frequent plan switching.

Method: TDP generates initial plans that become progressively more vague over time, then updates previous plans with small denoising steps at each time step rather than generating entirely new plans. Includes automated replanning mechanism to prevent plan-reality deviations.

Result: On D4RL benchmarks, TDP improves decision-making frequency by 11-24.8 times compared to previous methods while achieving higher or comparable performance.

Conclusion: TDP successfully addresses computational inefficiency in diffusion planning by distributing denoising across time, enabling more efficient decision-making without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Diffusion planning is a promising method for learning high-performance policies from offline data. To avoid the impact of discrepancies between planning and reality on performance, previous works generate new plans at each time step. However, this incurs significant computational overhead and leads to lower decision frequencies, and frequent plan switching may also affect performance. In contrast, humans might create detailed short-term plans and more general, sometimes vague, long-term plans, and adjust them over time. Inspired by this, we propose the Temporal Diffusion Planner (TDP) which improves decision efficiency by distributing the denoising steps across the time dimension. TDP begins by generating an initial plan that becomes progressively more vague over time. At each subsequent time step, rather than generating an entirely new plan, TDP updates the previous one with a small number of denoising steps. This reduces the average number of denoising steps, improving decision efficiency. Additionally, we introduce an automated replanning mechanism to prevent significant deviations between the plan and reality. Experiments on D4RL show that, compared to previous works that generate new plans every time step, TDP improves the decision-making frequency by 11-24.8 times while achieving higher or comparable performance.

TL;DR: A unified framework for offline data selection and online self-refining generation in LLM fine-tuning using bilevel optimization and learned data weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance data quality and improve LLM adaptation to downstream tasks through systematic data selection and generation refinement.

Method: Bilevel data selection for offline filtering and treating online self-refining generation as model adaptation with learned data weights for questions and responses.

Result: Theoretical demonstration of bilevel data selection effectiveness and performance gains over unfiltered baselines in quality enhancement and safety-aware fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Combining offline data selection with validation-weighted online generations improves fine-tuning performance for LLMs.

Abstract: Offline data selection and online self-refining generation, which enhance the data quality, are crucial steps in adapting large language models (LLMs) to specific downstream tasks. We tackle offline data selection and online self-refining generations through an optimization perspective. Specifically, bilevel data selection is used for offline data selection with respect to the validation dataset, and we treat online self-refining generation as a model adaptation step of selecting the model trained on current responses that best fits the validation data. Our framework offers a unified understanding of offline data selection and self-refining generation by assigning a learned data weight to each question and response, either explicitly or implicitly. For the first time, we theoretically demonstrate the effectiveness of the bilevel data selection framework and demonstrate its performance gains over unfiltered direct mixing baselines. By combining offline data with validation-weighted online generations, our method enhances fine-tuning performance. Experiments on quality enhancement and safety-aware LLM fine-tuning validate its effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge neural networks with randomized binary neural networks using hyperdimensional computing for efficient hardware implementation and robustness to model corruptions.

Method: Uses binary embeddings in hypercube with Hamming distance, creates floating-point G-Nets that can mimic standard layers, and embeds them as randomized binary EHD G-Nets leveraging concentration of measure.

Result: Binary models match CNN accuracies and outperform prior HDC models by large margins (e.g., ~30% higher accuracy on CIFAR-10).

Conclusion: G-Nets provide a theoretically justified bridge between neural networks and randomized binary neural networks, opening new directions for robust binary/quantized deep learning models.

Abstract: We propose a novel randomized algorithm for constructing binary neural networks with tunable accuracy. This approach is motivated by hyperdimensional computing (HDC), which is a brain-inspired paradigm that leverages high-dimensional vector representations, offering efficient hardware implementation and robustness to model corruptions. Unlike traditional low-precision methods that use quantization, we consider binary embeddings of data as points in the hypercube equipped with the Hamming distance. We propose a novel family of floating-point neural networks, G-Nets, which are general enough to mimic standard network layers. Each floating-point G-Net has a randomized binary embedding, an embedded hyperdimensional (EHD) G-Net, that retains the accuracy of its floating-point counterparts, with theoretical guarantees, due to the concentration of measure. Empirically, our binary models match convolutional neural network accuracies and outperform prior HDC models by large margins, for example, we achieve almost 30\% higher accuracy on CIFAR-10 compared to prior HDC models. G-Nets are a theoretically justified bridge between neural networks and randomized binary neural networks, opening a new direction for constructing robust binary/quantized deep learning models.

TL;DR: BFT is an efficient post-training method that enables LLMs to learn complex biomedical reasoning from sparse data without external rewards, outperforming SFT and achieving state-of-the-art results in medical and biological tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for aligning LLMs with biomedical knowledge face limitations: SFT overfits to surface patterns without internalizing fragmented scientific knowledge, while RL is impractical due to the prohibitive cost of experimental validation for reward signals.

Method: Balanced Fine-Tuning (BFT) uses a two-layer weighting mechanism: token-level scaling of loss via prediction probabilities to stabilize gradients and prevent overfitting, and sample-level weighting using 'minimum group confidence' to adaptively enhance learning of hard samples.

Result: BFT significantly outperforms SFT, enabling LLMs to acquire knowledge that SFT misses in medical tasks, and surpassing GeneAgent in biological process reasoning. BFT-generated embeddings can be directly applied to downstream tasks like gene interaction and single-cell perturbation response prediction.

Conclusion: BFT facilitates broad applications of LLMs in biomedical research by enabling effective learning from sparse data without external reward signals, making it a practical solution for aligning LLMs with specialized biomedical knowledge.

Abstract: Effective post-training is essential to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with specialized biomedical knowledge to accelerate life science research. However, current approaches face significant limitations. First, biomedical reasoning involves intricate mechanisms often represented by sparse textual data. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to overfit to surface-level instruction patterns without effectively internalizing this fragmented scientific knowledge. Second, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is impractical for this domain, as defining meaningful rewards often necessitates prohibitive experimental validation (e.g., wet-lab verification of drug responses), rendering real-time feedback unfeasible. We propose Balanced Fine-Tuning (BFT), an efficient post-training method designed to learn complex reasoning from sparse data without external reward signals. BFT operates through a two-layer weighting mechanism: 1. At the token level, it scales loss via prediction probabilities to stabilize gradients and prevent overfitting; 2. At the sample level, it uses "minimum group confidence" to adaptively enhance the learning of hard samples. Experiments demonstrate that BFT significantly outperforms SFT. In medical tasks, it enables LLMs to acquire knowledge that SFT misses. In biological tasks, BFT-based LLMs surpass GeneAgent (an accurate agent for biology analysis) in biological process reasoning. Moreover, the text embeddings generated by BFT can be directly applied to downstream tasks, such as gene interaction and single-cell perturbation response prediction. These results indicate that BFT facilitates broad applications of LLMs in biomedical research.

TL;DR: The Deceptron is a lightweight bidirectional module that learns local inverses for ill-conditioned inverse problems, enabling faster convergence through output-space gradient descent with inverse preconditioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse problems in physical sciences are often ill-conditioned in input space, making progress step-size sensitive and requiring many iterations for convergence.

Method: Proposes Deceptron module that learns local inverse of differentiable forward surrogate using supervised fit, forward-reverse consistency, spectral penalty, bias tie, and Jacobian Composition Penalty (JCP). Uses D-IPG (Deceptron Inverse-Preconditioned Gradient) for solving: takes descent step in output space, pulls back through learned inverse, and projects with backtracking.

Result: On Heat-1D initial-condition recovery and Damped Oscillator inverse problem, D-IPG achieves ~20x fewer iterations on Heat and ~2-3x fewer on Oscillator than projected gradient, competitive with Gauss-Newton. JCP reduces composition error and tracks iteration gains.

Conclusion: Deceptron provides efficient preconditioning for ill-conditioned inverse problems, enabling significant iteration reduction while maintaining convergence guarantees. The approach shows promise for extension to 2D problems with fast convergence.

Abstract: Inverse problems in the physical sciences are often ill-conditioned in input space, making progress step-size sensitive. We propose the Deceptron, a lightweight bidirectional module that learns a local inverse of a differentiable forward surrogate. Training combines a supervised fit, forward-reverse consistency, a lightweight spectral penalty, a soft bias tie, and a Jacobian Composition Penalty (JCP) that encourages $J_g(f(x))\,J_f(x)\!\approx\!I$ via JVP/VJP probes. At solve time, D-IPG (Deceptron Inverse-Preconditioned Gradient) takes a descent step in output space, pulls it back through $g$, and projects under the same backtracking and stopping rules as baselines. On Heat-1D initial-condition recovery and a Damped Oscillator inverse problem, D-IPG reaches a fixed normalized tolerance with $\sim$20$\times$ fewer iterations on Heat and $\sim$2-3$\times$ fewer on Oscillator than projected gradient, competitive in iterations and cost with Gauss-Newton. Diagnostics show JCP reduces a measured composition error and tracks iteration gains. We also preview a single-scale 2D instantiation, DeceptronNet (v0), that learns few-step corrections under a strict fairness protocol and exhibits notably fast convergence.

### [192] [MLPMoE: Zero-Shot Architectural Metamorphosis of Dense LLM MLPs into Static Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21089)
*Ivan Novikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MLPMoE is a training-free method that transforms dense transformer MLPs into static mixture-of-experts without requiring calibration data or router training, achieving minimal perplexity changes while maintaining parameter efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense transformer deployment is computationally inefficient since all parameters are activated for every token, while existing upcycling methods require clustering, activation profiling, or custom routing with calibration data.

Method: Uses tensor slicing and summation to restructure dense MLPs into static mixture-of-experts, with Fractal Fade and Compensated Pruning for structured sparsity - all without training, gradients, or calibration sets.

Result: On Qwen2.5-0.5B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, MLPMoE changes perplexity by <0.05% while keeping parameters constant; differential sparsity removes ~20% of MLP parameters with <2% perplexity increase.

Conclusion: MLPMoE provides an effective training-free approach for transformer upcycling that maintains performance while enabling structured sparsity, operating entirely post hoc on existing checkpoints.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly deployed as dense transformers, where every parameter in every feed-forward block is activated for every token. While architecturally simple, this is computationally inefficient, since inference costs scale linearly with parameter count. Recent upcycling methods such as MoEfication, CMoE, ToMoE, and MoORE reveal that much of the useful computation lives in sparse, semi-modular substructures inside dense feed-forward networks, but these approaches typically rely on clustering, activation profiling, singular value decomposition, or custom routing that requires calibration data. This paper introduces MLPMoE (MLP Mixture-of-Experts), a training-free, deterministic transformation that restructures the dense MLP in transformer blocks into a static, high-cardinality mixture of experts. The transformation uses simple tensor slicing and summation, reinterpreting the algebra of tensor parallelism as a topological conversion rather than a distributed training pattern. We further introduce Fractal Fade (differential branch sparsity) and Compensated Pruning (variance-preserving branch reduction) as lightweight mechanisms for structured sparsity. On Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, the zero-shot MLPMoE transform changes a proxy perplexity metric by less than 0.05 percent while keeping the parameter count effectively constant. On the 8B model, differential sparsity removes about 20 percent of MLP parameters while keeping perplexity within about 2 percent of the dense baseline. The method operates entirely post hoc on existing checkpoints and does not require gradients, calibration sets, or router training.

TL;DR: A hyperbolic geometry framework for neuroimaging meta-analysis that embeds text and brain images in shared hyperbolic space to capture semantic and hierarchical relationships, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of small sample sizes in neuroimaging studies and overcome shortcomings of traditional meta-analysis methods that ignore hierarchical brain structure.

Method: Leverage Lorentz model hyperbolic embeddings to align brain and text representations in shared hyperbolic space, enabling multi-level analysis that preserves semantic correspondence and hierarchical relationships.

Result: Experimental results show the model outperforms baseline methods, providing robust and interpretable multi-level neuroimaging meta-analysis.

Conclusion: The hyperbolic brain-text representation framework offers an effective paradigm for neuroimaging meta-analysis that captures both semantic similarity and hierarchical organization.

Abstract: Various neuroimaging studies suffer from small sample size problem which often limit their reliability. Meta-analysis addresses this challenge by aggregating findings from different studies to identify consistent patterns of brain activity. However, traditional approaches based on keyword retrieval or linear mappings often overlook the rich hierarchical structure in the brain. In this work, we propose a novel framework that leverages hyperbolic geometry to bridge the gap between neuroscience literature and brain activation maps. By embedding text from research articles and corresponding brain images into a shared hyperbolic space via the Lorentz model, our method captures both semantic similarity and hierarchical organization inherent in neuroimaging data. In the hyperbolic space, our method performs multi-level neuroimaging meta-analysis (MNM) by 1) aligning brain and text embeddings for semantic correspondence, 2) guiding hierarchy between text and brain activations, and 3) preserving the hierarchical relationships within brain activation patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms baselines, offering a robust and interpretable paradigm of multi-level neuroimaging meta-analysis via hyperbolic brain-text representation.

TL;DR: Proposes Generative Early Stage Ranking (GESR) with Mixture of Attention (MoA) modules to improve effectiveness in early-stage ranking systems while maintaining efficiency through hardware optimizations and caching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional early stage ranking systems use user-item decoupling which is efficient but struggles to capture fine-grained user-item affinities and cross-signals, limiting effectiveness.

Method: Introduces Mixture of Attention (MoA) with Hard Matching Attention for explicit cross-signals, Target-Aware Self Attention for personalized user representations, and Cross Attention for enriched interactions, plus Multi-Logit Parameterized Gating for final refinement.

Result: Substantial improvements in topline metrics, engagement, and consumption tasks validated by offline and online experiments. First successful deployment of full target-aware attention sequence modeling at scale in ESR stage.

Conclusion: GESR paradigm successfully bridges the effectiveness gap in early stage ranking while maintaining efficiency through comprehensive optimization techniques, enabling better user-item interaction modeling at scale.

Abstract: Large-scale recommendations commonly adopt a multi-stage cascading ranking system paradigm to balance effectiveness and efficiency. Early Stage Ranking (ESR) systems utilize the "user-item decoupling" approach, where independently learned user and item representations are only combined at the final layer. While efficient, this design is limited in effectiveness, as it struggles to capture fine-grained user-item affinities and cross-signals. To address these, we propose the Generative Early Stage Ranking (GESR) paradigm, introducing the Mixture of Attention (MoA) module which leverages diverse attention mechanisms to bridge the effectiveness gap: the Hard Matching Attention (HMA) module encodes explicit cross-signals by computing raw match counts between user and item features; the Target-Aware Self Attention module generates target-aware user representations conditioned on the item, enabling more personalized learning; and the Cross Attention modules facilitate early and more enriched interactions between user-item features. MoA's specialized attention encodings are further refined in the final layer through a Multi-Logit Parameterized Gating (MLPG) module, which integrates the newly learned embeddings via gating and produces secondary logits that are fused with the primary logit. To address the efficiency and latency challenges, we have introduced a comprehensive suite of optimization techniques. These span from custom kernels that maximize the capabilities of the latest hardware to efficient serving solutions powered by caching mechanisms. The proposed GESR paradigm has shown substantial improvements in topline metrics, engagement, and consumption tasks, as validated by both offline and online experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this marks the first successful deployment of full target-aware attention sequence modeling within an ESR stage at such a scale.

*Hengyu Fu,Baihe Huang,Virginia Adams,Charles Wang,Venkat Srinivasan,Jiantao Jiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Standard diffusion language model decoding strategies that rely on high-confidence tokens are inefficient due to an information-theoretic bottleneck. The proposed Explore-Then-Exploit strategy maximizes information throughput by combining cross-block decoding with targeted exploration of high-uncertainty tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion language models offer faster inference than autoregressive models but face efficiency limitations because high-confidence tokens carry negligible information, creating a bottleneck that slows generation.

Method: Proposed Explore-Then-Exploit (ETE) decoding strategy that uses cross-block decoding and targeted exploration of high-uncertainty tokens to reshape conditional distributions and trigger confident prediction cascades.

Result: ETE consistently reduces the required number of decoding rounds compared to confidence-only baselines without compromising generation quality, verifying theoretical bounds about information throughput.

Conclusion: Prioritizing high-uncertainty tokens through strategic exploration can overcome the information-theoretic bottleneck in diffusion language models, enabling more efficient decoding while maintaining generation quality.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a strong alternative to autoregressive language models (LMs). DLMs offer comparable accuracy with faster inference speed via parallel decoding. However, standard DLM decoding strategies relying on high-confidence tokens encounter an inherent information-theoretic bottleneck that restricts decoding progress and ultimately slows generation. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that prioritizing high-confidence tokens is inherently inefficient. High-probability tokens carry negligible information and strictly relying on them limits the effective progress made in each decoding round. We prove that the number of decoding rounds must grow linearly with the sample's total information (negative log-likelihood) and inversely with the per-round information budget, establishing a bits-to-rounds principle. We also propose Explore-Then-Exploit (ETE), a training-free decoding strategy that maximizes information throughput and decoding efficiency. ETE combines cross-block decoding with targeted exploration of high-uncertainty tokens to reshape the conditional distribution and trigger cascades of confident predictions. Experiments verify our theoretical bounds and demonstrate that ETE consistently reduces the required number of decoding rounds compared to confidence-only baselines without compromising generation quality.

TL;DR: BRIDGE introduces structured prompting that decomposes program verification into three domains (Code, Specifications, Proofs) to improve verified program generation in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with program verification in interactive proof frameworks like Lean4 due to scalability challenges in generating code, specifications, and proofs simultaneously.

Method: Decomposes verification into three interconnected domains with distinct reasoning behaviors: functional (executable implementations), specification-driven (formal intent statements), and proof-oriented (constructive correctness arguments).

Result: Functional reasoning improves Lean4 code correctness by 1.5x (pass@5) and is 2x more efficient. Specification-driven prompting boosts Python coding pass rates by up to 17.5%.

Conclusion: Structured domain alignment is a promising direction for verified synthesis, establishing foundation for training via expert iteration or RLVR to internalize reasoning strategies across code, specifications, and proofs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in code generation, yet struggle with program verification, especially in interactive proof frameworks such as Lean4. A central challenge is scalability: verified synthesis requires not just code, but also precise specifications and correctness proofs, and existing approaches rarely span all three domains. We present BRIDGE, the first systematic study of structured prompting for scalable verified program generation. BRIDGE decomposes verification into three interconnected domains: Code (executable implementations), Specifications (formal intent statements), and Proofs (constructive correctness arguments). Our key idea is to elicit distinct reasoning behaviors functional, specification-driven, and proof-oriented as intermediate representations that preserve semantic structure and connect these domains. Through systematic ablations, we show that this approach substantially improves both accuracy and efficiency beyond standard error feedback methods. For example, functional reasoning improves correctness of code in formal languages (Lean4) by nearly 1.5x (pass@5) over direct baselines. In inference-time compute, functional reasoning is also 2x more efficient, achieving higher pass rates with fewer generations and lower total sampling budgets. Similarly, we find that specification-driven prompting boosts Python coding pass rates by up to 17.5%. These findings suggest that structured domain alignment is a promising direction for advancing verified synthesis. BRIDGE establishes a foundation for training via expert iteration or RLVR, enabling models to internalize these reasoning strategies across code, specifications, and proofs.

TL;DR: Dynamic Stratified Contrastive Training Framework for MILP Branching that addresses semantic variation, data scarcity, and expensive strong branching samples through node grouping and upstream augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural-based branching methods struggle with semantic variation across depths, scarcity of upstream nodes, and costly collection of strong branching samples in MILP solving.

Method: Groups B&B nodes by feature distributions, trains GCNN model to progressively separate nodes across groups, and uses upstream-augmented MILP derivation to generate equivalent and perturbed instances.

Result: Significantly enhances branching accuracy and solving efficiency, particularly for upstream nodes, and reduces solving time on standard MILP benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively models subtle semantic differences between nodes, improves branching performance, and generalizes well to unseen instances.

Abstract: Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a fundamental class of NP-hard problems that has garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. The Branch-and-Bound (B\&B) method is the dominant approach for solving MILPs and the branching plays an important role in B\&B methods. Neural-based learning frameworks have recently been developed to enhance branching policies and the efficiency of solving MILPs. However, these methods still struggle with semantic variation across depths, the scarcity of upstream nodes, and the costly collection of strong branching samples. To address these issues, we propose \ours, a Dynamic \underline{\textbf{S}}tratified \underline{\textbf{C}}ontrastive Training Framework for \underline{\textbf{MILP}} Branching. It groups branch-and-bound nodes based on their feature distributions and trains a GCNN-based discriminative model to progressively separate nodes across groups, learning finer-grained node representations throughout the tree. To address data scarcity and imbalance at upstream nodes, we introduce an upstream-augmented MILP derivation procedure that generates both theoretically equivalent and perturbed instances. \ours~effectively models subtle semantic differences between nodes, significantly enhancing branching accuracy and solving efficiency, particularly for upstream nodes. Extensive experiments on standard MILP benchmarks demonstrate that our method enhances branching accuracy, reduces solving time, and generalizes effectively to unseen instances.

Motivation: Existing fair clustering methods lack interpretability, limiting their applicability in high-stakes scenarios where understanding clustering decisions is essential.

Method: Integrates fairness constraints into decision trees to partition data while ensuring fair treatment across protected groups, with a variant using post-pruning of trees constructed without fairness constraints to avoid hyperparameter tuning.

Result: Extensive experiments show competitive clustering performance, improved fairness, interpretability, ability to handle multiple sensitive attributes, and robustness under complex fairness constraints.

Conclusion: The framework enables equitable and transparent clustering with interpretable decision trees, opening new possibilities for fair clustering applications.

Abstract: Fair clustering has gained increasing attention in recent years, especially in applications involving socially sensitive attributes. However, existing fair clustering methods often lack interpretability, limiting their applicability in high-stakes scenarios where understanding the rationale behind clustering decisions is essential. In this work, we address this limitation by proposing an interpretable and fair clustering framework, which integrates fairness constraints into the structure of decision trees. Our approach constructs interpretable decision trees that partition the data while ensuring fair treatment across protected groups. To further enhance the practicality of our framework, we also introduce a variant that requires no fairness hyperparameter tuning, achieved through post-pruning a tree constructed without fairness constraints. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method not only delivers competitive clustering performance and improved fairness, but also offers additional advantages such as interpretability and the ability to handle multiple sensitive attributes. These strengths enable our method to perform robustly under complex fairness constraints, opening new possibilities for equitable and transparent clustering.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to realize the democratic vision of distributed AI where edge devices can collectively improve models without surrendering sensitive data, overcoming current limitations in accountability, economic mechanisms, scalability, and governance.

Method: The method uses cryptographic receipts to prove aggregation correctness, geometric novelty measurement to prevent incentive gaming, parallel object ownership to achieve linear scalability, and time-locked policies to check retroactive manipulation.

Result: The proposed approach addresses the compositional gaps in federated learning systems, enabling secure, scalable, and accountable distributed model training across billions of edge devices.

Conclusion: The work successfully bridges key gaps in federated learning systems, paving the way for truly democratic and scalable distributed AI that maintains data privacy while enabling collective model improvement.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is retracing the Internet's path from centralized provision to distributed creation. Initially, resource-intensive computation concentrates within institutions capable of training and serving large models.Eventually, as federated learning matures, billions of edge devices holding sensitive data will be able to collectively improve models without surrendering raw information, enabling both contribution and consumption at scale. This democratic vision remains unrealized due to certain compositional gaps; aggregators handle updates without accountability, economic mechanisms are lacking and even when present remain vulnerable to gaming, coordination serializes state modifications limiting scalability, and governance permits retroactive manipulation. This work addresses these gaps by leveraging cryptographic receipts to prove aggregation correctness, geometric novelty measurement to prevent incentive gaming, parallel object ownership to achieve linear scalability, and time-locked policies to check retroactive manipulation.

Abstract: Understanding how chemical perturbations propagate through biological systems is essential for robust molecular property prediction. While most existing methods focus on chemical structures alone, recent advances highlight the crucial role of cellular responses such as morphology and gene expression in shaping drug effects. However, current cell-aware approaches face two key limitations: (1) modality incompleteness in external biological data, and (2) insufficient modeling of hierarchical dependencies across molecular, cellular, and genomic levels. We propose CHMR (Cell-aware Hierarchical Multi-modal Representations), a robust framework that jointly models local-global dependencies between molecules and cellular responses and captures latent biological hierarchies via a novel tree-structured vector quantization module. Evaluated on nine public benchmarks spanning 728 tasks, CHMR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding average improvements of 3.6% on classification and 17.2% on regression tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used as evaluators but their judgments are noisy due to imperfect specificity and sensitivity, leading to biased accuracy estimates. Existing bias-correction methods are underutilized and assume exact knowledge of specificity/sensitivity.

Method: A simple plug-in framework that corrects bias and constructs confidence intervals reflecting uncertainty from both test and calibration datasets. Also introduces an adaptive algorithm for efficient calibration sample size allocation.

Result: Enables practical and statistically sound LLM-based evaluation by properly accounting for uncertainty in specificity and sensitivity estimates.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a practical solution for bias correction and uncertainty quantification in LLM-based evaluation, addressing key limitations of current approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators in lieu of humans. While scalable, their judgments are noisy due to imperfect specificity and sensitivity of LLMs, leading to biased accuracy estimates. Although bias-correction methods exist, they are underutilized in LLM research and typically assume exact knowledge of the model's specificity and sensitivity. Furthermore, in general we only have estimates of these values and it is not well known how to properly construct confidence intervals using only estimates. This work presents a simple plug-in framework that corrects such bias and constructs confidence intervals reflecting uncertainty from both test and calibration dataset, enabling practical and statistically sound LLM-based evaluation. Additionally, to reduce uncertainty in the accuracy estimate, we introduce an adaptive algorithm that efficiently allocates calibration sample sizes.

### [202] [Privacy in Federated Learning with Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21181)
*Dogukan Aksu,Jesus Martinez del Rincon,Ihsen Alouani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SNNs show inherent privacy advantages over ANNs in federated learning, as gradient inversion attacks yield noisy, uninformative reconstructions due to event-driven dynamics and surrogate-gradient training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the privacy implications of gradient inversion attacks in SNNs, which remain unexplored despite SNNs' growing use in edge AI and federated learning scenarios where privacy is critical.

Method: Adapted different gradient leakage attacks to the spike domain and conducted comprehensive empirical study across diverse data domains, comparing SNN gradient informativeness with conventional ANNs.

Result: SNN gradients yield noisy, temporally inconsistent reconstructions that fail to recover meaningful spatial or temporal structure, unlike ANN gradients which reliably expose salient input content.

Conclusion: SNNs provide inherent privacy-preserving benefits in federated learning due to reduced gradient informativeness from event-driven dynamics and surrogate-gradient training.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as prominent candidates for embedded and edge AI. Their inherent low power consumption makes them far more efficient than conventional ANNs in scenarios where energy budgets are tightly constrained. In parallel, federated learning (FL) has become the prevailing training paradigm in such settings, enabling on-device learning while limiting the exposure of raw data. However, gradient inversion attacks represent a critical privacy threat in FL, where sensitive training data can be reconstructed directly from shared gradients. While this vulnerability has been widely investigated in conventional ANNs, its implications for SNNs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first comprehensive empirical study of gradient leakage in SNNs across diverse data domains. SNNs are inherently non-differentiable and are typically trained using surrogate gradients, which we hypothesized would be less correlated with the original input and thus less informative from a privacy perspective. To investigate this, we adapt different gradient leakage attacks to the spike domain. Our experiments reveal a striking contrast with conventional ANNs: whereas ANN gradients reliably expose salient input content, SNN gradients yield noisy, temporally inconsistent reconstructions that fail to recover meaningful spatial or temporal structure. These results indicate that the combination of event-driven dynamics and surrogate-gradient training substantially reduces gradient informativeness. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first systematic benchmark of gradient inversion attacks for spiking architectures, highlighting the inherent privacy-preserving potential of neuromorphic computation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to disentangle complex degradation mechanisms in multi-sensor systems and lack uncertainty quantification in health indicator reliability.

Method: Adapts RaPP as health indicator, augments with uncertainty quantification via Monte Carlo dropout and probabilistic latent spaces, and introduces indicator groups to isolate sensor subsets for mechanism-specific degradation modeling (I-GLIDE method).

Result: Outperforms traditional reconstruction error metrics, achieves marked improvements in accuracy and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art HI methods on aerospace and manufacturing data.

Conclusion: Bridges gap between anomaly detection and prognostics, providing principled framework for uncertainty-aware degradation modeling with actionable insights into system failure pathways.

Abstract: Accurate remaining useful life (RUL) prediction hinges on the quality of health indicators (HIs), yet existing methods often fail to disentangle complex degradation mechanisms in multi-sensor systems or quantify uncertainty in HI reliability. This paper introduces a novel framework for HI construction, advancing three key contributions. First, we adapt Reconstruction along Projected Pathways (RaPP) as a health indicator (HI) for RUL prediction for the first time, showing that it outperforms traditional reconstruction error metrics. Second, we show that augmenting RaPP-derived HIs with aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty quantification (UQ) via Monte Carlo dropout and probabilistic latent spaces- significantly improves RUL-prediction robustness. Third, and most critically, we propose indicator groups, a paradigm that isolates sensor subsets to model system-specific degradations, giving rise to our novel method, I-GLIDE which enables interpretable, mechanism-specific diagnostics. Evaluated on data sourced from aerospace and manufacturing systems, our approach achieves marked improvements in accuracy and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art HI methods while providing actionable insights into system failure pathways. This work bridges the gap between anomaly detection and prognostics, offering a principled framework for uncertainty-aware degradation modeling in complex systems.

Motivation: Traditional FEM methods are computationally expensive, while pure data-driven ML models lack generalization and physics understanding. Need for hybrid approaches that bridge computational efficiency with physical accuracy.

Method: Proposed a Physics-Informed U-Net LSTM framework that embeds domain-specific physical constraints into the deep learning process, combining U-Net and LSTM architectures with physics-based modeling.

Result: The hybrid model achieves improved predictive performance over conventional ML architectures, offering better accuracy and computational efficiency for seismic response prediction.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully bridges the gap between data-driven methods and physics-based modeling, providing a robust and efficient alternative for seismic analysis of structures.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient seismic response prediction is essential for the design of resilient structures. While the Finite Element Method (FEM) remains the standard for nonlinear seismic analysis, its high computational demands limit its scalability and real time applicability. Recent developments in deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models, have shown promise in reducing the computational cost of nonlinear seismic analysis of structures. However, these data driven models often struggle to generalize and capture the underlying physics, leading to reduced reliability. We propose a novel Physics Informed U Net LSTM framework that integrates physical laws with deep learning to enhance both accuracy and efficiency. By embedding domain specific constraints into the learning process, the proposed model achieves improved predictive performance over conventional Machine Learning architectures. This hybrid approach bridges the gap between purely data driven methods and physics based modeling, offering a robust and computationally efficient alternative for seismic response prediction of structures.

In addition, our framework is such flexible that both regular and irregular time-series can be synthesized with minimal changes to our model design. Finally, we obtain exceptional synthesis performance on various time-series datasets, achieving state-of-the-art sampling diversity and quality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MDLMs have locality bias favoring local context and suffer from mask distraction during generation, but a mask-agnostic loss can improve robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine context comprehension limitations of Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs) compared to Autoregressive Language Models (ARLMs).

Method: Systematic ablations to analyze locality bias and mask distraction effects, plus introducing a mask-agnostic loss function for fine-tuning.

Result: MDLMs exhibit strong locality bias favoring local context and performance degrades with many appended mask tokens. The mask-agnostic loss substantially mitigates mask distraction.

Conclusion: Current MDLM training has critical limitations in context comprehension, but mask-agnostic training provides actionable improvements for building stronger diffusion-based language models.

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to Autoregressive Language Models (ARLMs), leveraging a denoising objective that, in principle, should enable more uniform context utilisation. In this work, we examine the context comprehension abilities of MDLMs and uncover two key limitations. First, despite their more global training objective and bidirectional attention mechanism, similarly to ARLMS, MDLMs exhibit a strong locality bias: performance is highly sensitive to the position of relevant information within the input, favouring local over distant context. Second, we show that appending a large number of mask tokens--required for generation--can significantly degrade context comprehension. Through systematic ablations, we find that these masks act as distractors, reducing the model's ability to process relevant information. To address this, we introduce a mask-agnostic loss function that encourages predictions to remain invariant to the number of appended masks. Fine-tuning with this objective substantially mitigates the distracting effect of masks, improving robustness of MDLMs. Overall, our findings reveal critical limitations of the current MDLM training paradigm and provide actionable insights for building diffusion-based language models with stronger context comprehension.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AIRL struggles with sparse reward problems in complex imperfect-information settings like poker, where it fails to infer sufficiently informative reward functions.

Method: Hybrid-AIRL (H-AIRL) extends AIRL by incorporating a supervised loss from expert data and a stochastic regularization mechanism to enhance reward inference and policy learning.

Result: H-AIRL achieves higher sample efficiency and more stable learning compared to AIRL on Gymnasium benchmarks and HULHE poker, with visualized reward functions providing deeper learning insights.

Conclusion: Incorporating supervised signals into inverse RL is beneficial, establishing H-AIRL as a promising framework for challenging real-world settings with sparse, delayed rewards and uncertainty.

Abstract: Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (AIRL) has shown promise in addressing the sparse reward problem in reinforcement learning (RL) by inferring dense reward functions from expert demonstrations. However, its performance in highly complex, imperfect-information settings remains largely unexplored. To explore this gap, we evaluate AIRL in the context of Heads-Up Limit Hold'em (HULHE) poker, a domain characterized by sparse, delayed rewards and significant uncertainty. In this setting, we find that AIRL struggles to infer a sufficiently informative reward function. To overcome this limitation, we contribute Hybrid-AIRL (H-AIRL), an extension that enhances reward inference and policy learning by incorporating a supervised loss derived from expert data and a stochastic regularization mechanism. We evaluate H-AIRL on a carefully selected set of Gymnasium benchmarks and the HULHE poker setting. Additionally, we analyze the learned reward function through visualization to gain deeper insights into the learning process. Our experimental results show that H-AIRL achieves higher sample efficiency and more stable learning compared to AIRL. This highlights the benefits of incorporating supervised signals into inverse RL and establishes H-AIRL as a promising framework for tackling challenging, real-world settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fidelity metrics rely on Monte Carlo approximation, requiring numerous model evaluations and introducing uncertainty due to random sampling, which is problematic for high-stakes applications like medical settings.

Method: Modified the existing Prediction Change (PC) metric within the Guided Perturbation Experiment by incorporating the direction of both perturbation and attribution to create the Directed Prediction Change (DPC) metric.

Result: DPC achieves almost tenfold speedup, eliminates randomness, and provides deterministic outcomes while measuring the same property as local Infidelity. Evaluated on 4,744 explanations across medical and financial datasets.

Conclusion: DPC together with PC enables holistic and computationally efficient evaluation of both baseline-oriented and local feature attribution methods with deterministic and reproducible outcomes.

Abstract: The utility of an explanation method critically depends on its fidelity to the underlying machine learning model. Especially in high-stakes medical settings, clinicians and regulators require explanations that faithfully reflect the model's decision process. Existing fidelity metrics such as Infidelity rely on Monte Carlo approximation, which demands numerous model evaluations and introduces uncertainty due to random sampling. This work proposes a novel metric for evaluating the fidelity of local feature attribution methods by modifying the existing Prediction Change (PC) metric within the Guided Perturbation Experiment. By incorporating the direction of both perturbation and attribution, the proposed Directed Prediction Change (DPC) metric achieves an almost tenfold speedup and eliminates randomness, resulting in a deterministic and trustworthy evaluation procedure that measures the same property as local Infidelity. DPC is evaluated on two datasets (skin lesion images and financial tabular data), two black-box models, seven explanation algorithms, and a wide range of hyperparameters. Across $4\,744$ distinct explanations, the results demonstrate that DPC, together with PC, enables a holistic and computationally efficient evaluation of both baseline-oriented and local feature attribution methods, while providing deterministic and reproducible outcomes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes parameter-dependent learning rates for query and key weights to stabilize transformer training, enabling higher base learning rates and competitive performance with QK normalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: QK normalization fixes stability issues but is incompatible with Multi Latent Attention (MLA) due to requiring full materialization of queries and keys during inference.

Method: Assign parameter-dependent learning rates to query and key weights to control changes to logits for stability.

Result: Enables increased base learning rate, outperforms other methods in MLA setting, and achieves performance competitive with QK norm in Multi-head Attention.

Conclusion: Controlling logit changes through parameter-dependent learning rates provides a cheap and effective alternative to QK normalization for transformer stability.

Abstract: Stability of neural network weights is critical when training transformer models. The query and key weights are particularly problematic, as they tend to grow large without any intervention. Applying normalization to queries and keys, known as `QK norm', fixes stability issues in practice, but is not always applicable. For example, QK norm is not compatible with Multi Latent Attention (MLA) because QK norm requires full materialization of queries and keys during inference, which is not done in MLA. In this paper we suggest that controlling the changes to logits is important for stability. We show that these changes are controllable by assigning parameter-dependent learning rates to the query and key weights. We find that our cheap intervention allows us to increase the base learning rate of the network, outperform other methods in the MLA setting, and achieve performance competitive with QK norm when using Multi-head Attention.

Conclusion: AAR provides a scalable and reliable solution for handling contaminated data in anomaly detection, enabling broader real-world applications in security, healthcare, and other domains.

Abstract: Handling contaminated data poses a critical challenge in anomaly detection, as traditional models assume training on purely normal data. Conventional methods mitigate contamination by relying on fixed contamination ratios, but discrepancies between assumed and actual ratios can severely degrade performance, especially in noisy environments where normal and abnormal data distributions overlap. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive and Aggressive Rejection (AAR), a novel method that dynamically excludes anomalies using a modified z-score and Gaussian mixture model-based thresholds. AAR effectively balances the trade-off between preserving normal data and excluding anomalies by integrating hard and soft rejection strategies. Extensive experiments on two image datasets and thirty tabular datasets demonstrate that AAR outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 0.041 AUROC. By providing a scalable and reliable solution, AAR enhances robustness against contaminated datasets, paving the way for broader real-world applications in domains such as security and healthcare.

Conclusion: Advances state-of-the-art in low-resource language sentiment analysis and provides scalable solution for Bangla e-commerce analytics.

Abstract: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) has emerged as a critical tool for extracting fine-grained sentiment insights from user-generated content, particularly in e-commerce and social media domains. However, research on Bangla ABSA remains significantly underexplored due to the absence of comprehensive datasets and specialized frameworks for triplet extraction in this language. This paper introduces BanglaASTE, a novel framework for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) that simultaneously identifies aspect terms, opinion expressions, and sentiment polarities from Bangla product reviews. Our contributions include: (1) creation of the first annotated Bangla ASTE dataset containing 3,345 product reviews collected from major e-commerce platforms including Daraz, Facebook, and Rokomari; (2) development of a hybrid classification framework that employs graph-based aspect-opinion matching with semantic similarity techniques; and (3) implementation of an ensemble model combining BanglaBERT contextual embeddings with XGBoost boosting algorithms for enhanced triplet extraction performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our ensemble approach achieves superior performance with 89.9% accuracy and 89.1% F1-score, significantly outperforming baseline models across all evaluation metrics. The framework effectively addresses key challenges in Bangla text processing including informal expressions, spelling variations, and data sparsity. This research advances the state-of-the-art in low-resource language sentiment analysis and provides a scalable solution for Bangla e-commerce analytics applications.

*Zachary Morrow,Michael Penwarden,Brian Chen,Aurya Javeed,Akil Narayan,John D. Jakeman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SUPNs (shallow universal polynomial networks) replace most hidden layers with a single polynomial layer, achieving better approximation with fewer parameters than DNNs and KANs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNNs and KANs require many parameters, leading to optimization challenges, local minima, and sensitivity to initialization. SUPNs aim to reduce parameter count while maintaining expressivity.

Method: Replace all but the last hidden layer with a single polynomial layer with learnable coefficients, combining strengths of DNNs and polynomials.

Result: SUPNs converge at same rate as best polynomial approximation, achieve lower approximation error and variability than DNNs/KANs by order of magnitude, and outperform polynomial projection on non-smooth functions.

Conclusion: SUPNs provide an effective alternative to DNNs and KANs with fewer parameters and better performance in tested scenarios.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) are popular methods for function approximation due to their flexibility and expressivity. However, they typically require a large number of trainable parameters to produce a suitable approximation. Beyond making the resulting network less transparent, overparameterization creates a large optimization space, likely producing local minima in training that have quite different generalization errors. In this case, network initialization can have an outsize impact on the model's out-of-sample accuracy. For these reasons, we propose shallow universal polynomial networks (SUPNs). These networks replace all but the last hidden layer with a single layer of polynomials with learnable coefficients, leveraging the strengths of DNNs and polynomials to achieve sufficient expressivity with far fewer parameters. We prove that SUPNs converge at the same rate as the best polynomial approximation of the same degree, and we derive explicit formulas for quasi-optimal SUPN parameters. We complement theory with an extensive suite of numerical experiments involving SUPNs, DNNs, KANs, and polynomial projection in one, two, and ten dimensions, consisting of over 13,000 trained models. On the target functions we numerically studied, for a given number of trainable parameters, the approximation error and variability are often lower for SUPNs than for DNNs and KANs by an order of magnitude. In our examples, SUPNs even outperform polynomial projection on non-smooth functions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between ensemble size and computational efficiency, as excessively large ensembles can cause diminishing returns and inefficiency despite generally improving accuracy.

Method: Proposes a geometric model based on linear independence of classifier votes, generalizes to weighted majority voting, derives theoretical probability framework for linear independence, and validates with experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets using OzaBagging and GOOWE methods.

Result: The theoretical estimate effectively identifies performance saturation points for robust ensembles like OzaBagging, while revealing that high theoretical diversity can cause instability in complex weighting schemes like GOOWE.

Conclusion: The linear independence framework provides a principled approach to determine optimal ensemble size, balancing accuracy and computational efficiency, with implications for ensemble design and stability analysis.

Abstract: Ensemble learning improves classification performance by combining multiple base classifiers. While increasing the number of classifiers generally enhances accuracy, excessively large ensembles can lead to computational inefficiency and diminishing returns. This paper investigates the relationship between ensemble size and performance through the lens of linear independence among classifier votes in data streams. We propose that ensembles composed of linearly independent classifiers maximize representational capacity, particularly under a geometric model. We then generalize the importance of linear independence to the weighted majority voting problem. By modeling the probability of achieving linear independence among classifier outputs, we derive a theoretical framework that explains the trade-off between ensemble size and accuracy. Our analysis leads to a theoretical estimate of the ensemble size required to achieve a user-specified probability of linear independence. We validate our theory through experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets using two ensemble methods, OzaBagging and GOOWE. Our results confirm that this theoretical estimate effectively identifies the point of performance saturation for robust ensembles like OzaBagging. Conversely, for complex weighting schemes like GOOWE, our framework reveals that high theoretical diversity can trigger algorithmic instability. Our implementation is publicly available to support reproducibility and future research.

*William De Deyn,Michael Herty,Giovanni Samaey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes two-layer neural networks trained with consensus-based optimization (CBO) and compares it with Adam, showing that a hybrid CBO-Adam approach converges faster. It also extends CBO to multi-task learning with reduced memory overhead and develops a mean-field limit formulation in optimal transport framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve neural network training by exploring particle-based optimization methods like CBO, compare their performance with standard optimizers like Adam, and develop theoretical foundations through mean-field analysis.

Method: Used consensus-based optimization (CBO) for training two-layer neural networks, compared with Adam optimizer, developed hybrid CBO-Adam approach, extended CBO to multi-task learning with memory-efficient formulation, and established mean-field limit using optimal transport framework.

Result: Hybrid CBO-Adam approach provides faster convergence than CBO alone. The reformulated CBO for multi-task learning reduces memory overhead. The mean-field limit analysis shows monotonic decrease of variance in the Wasserstein-over-Wasserstein space.

Conclusion: CBO and its hybrid variants offer promising alternatives to traditional optimization methods for neural networks, with theoretical guarantees provided through mean-field analysis and practical benefits in convergence speed and memory efficiency.

Abstract: We study two-layer neural networks and train these with a particle-based method called consensus-based optimization (CBO). We compare the performance of CBO against Adam on two test cases and demonstrate how a hybrid approach, combining CBO with Adam, provides faster convergence than CBO. In the context of multi-task learning, we recast CBO into a formulation that offers less memory overhead. The CBO method allows for a mean-field limit formulation, which we couple with the mean-field limit of the neural network. To this end, we first reformulate CBO within the optimal transport framework. Finally, in the limit of infinitely many particles, we define the corresponding dynamics on the Wasserstein-over-Wasserstein space and show that the variance decreases monotonically.

*Qian Hong,Cheng Bian,Xiao Zhou,Xiaoyu Li,Yelei Li,Zijing Zeng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ShiftSyncNet is a meta-learning framework that automatically corrects temporal misalignment in multimodal physiological signal transformation (e.g., PPG/BCG to ABP), improving transformation accuracy by learning time offsets and applying Fourier phase shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temporal misalignment in multimodal signal transformation impairs accuracy in capturing critical features like ABP peaks, and existing synchronization methods rely on strong similarity assumptions or manual tuning while LNL approaches are ineffective under time-shifted supervision.

Method: Meta-learning-based bi-level optimization framework with transformation network (TransNet) and time-shift correction network (SyncNet), where SyncNet learns time offsets between training pairs and applies Fourier phase shifts to align supervision signals.

Result: Outperforms strong baselines by 9.4%, 6.0%, and 12.8% on one real-world industrial dataset and two public datasets, effectively correcting time shifts and improving transformation accuracy.

Conclusion: ShiftSyncNet provides an effective solution for addressing temporal inconsistencies in multimodal physiological transformation, pointing toward a unified direction for handling temporal misalignment challenges.

Abstract: Translating non-invasive signals such as photoplethysmography (PPG) and ballistocardiography (BCG) into clinically meaningful signals like arterial blood pressure (ABP) is vital for continuous, low-cost healthcare monitoring. However, temporal misalignment in multimodal signal transformation impairs transformation accuracy, especially in capturing critical features like ABP peaks. Conventional synchronization methods often rely on strong similarity assumptions or manual tuning, while existing Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) approaches are ineffective under time-shifted supervision, either discarding excessive data or failing to correct label shifts. To address this challenge, we propose ShiftSyncNet, a meta-learning-based bi-level optimization framework that automatically mitigates performance degradation due to time misalignment. It comprises a transformation network (TransNet) and a time-shift correction network (SyncNet), where SyncNet learns time offsets between training pairs and applies Fourier phase shifts to align supervision signals. Experiments on one real-world industrial dataset and two public datasets show that ShiftSyncNet outperforms strong baselines by 9.4%, 6.0%, and 12.8%, respectively. The results highlight its effectiveness in correcting time shifts, improving label quality, and enhancing transformation accuracy across diverse misalignment scenarios, pointing toward a unified direction for addressing temporal inconsistencies in multimodal physiological transformation.

*Wanli Zhong,Haibo Feng,Zirui Zhou,Hanyang Peng,Shiqi Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IntAttention enables fully integer attention pipeline for Transformers on edge devices, eliminating softmax bottleneck and achieving 3.7x speedup and 61% energy reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer deployment on edge devices is limited by softmax bottleneck in INT8 quantization, which causes costly dequantize-softmax-requantize detour accounting for up to 65% of attention latency.

Method: Proposes IntAttention with IndexSoftmax operator that replaces floating-point exponentials in integer domain using sparsity-aware clipping, 32-entry lookup-table approximation, and direct integer normalization.

Result: Achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 61% energy reduction over FP16 baselines, and 2.0x faster than conventional INT8 attention pipelines on Armv8 CPUs with comparable accuracy.

Conclusion: Enables practical and efficient Transformer inference on commodity edge devices through fully integer attention pipeline without retraining.

Abstract: Deploying Transformer models on edge devices is limited by latency and energy budgets. While INT8 quantization effectively accelerates the primary matrix multiplications, it exposes the softmax as the dominant bottleneck. This stage incurs a costly dequantize-softmax-requantize detour, which can account for up to 65% of total attention latency and disrupts the end-to-end integer dataflow critical for edge hardware efficiency. To address this limitation, we present IntAttention, the first fully integer, plug-and-play attention pipeline without retraining. At the core of our approach lies IndexSoftmax, a hardware-friendly operator that replaces floating-point exponentials entirely within the integer domain. IntAttention integrates sparsity-aware clipping, a 32-entry lookup-table approximation, and direct integer normalization, thereby eliminating all datatype conversion overhead. We evaluate IntAttention and demonstrate consistent and substantial gains. Our method achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 61% energy reduction over FP16 baselines and 2.0x faster than conventional INT8 attention pipelines on Armv8 CPUs. These gains are achieved with high-fidelity accuracy comparable to baselines across diverse language and vision models, enabling practical and efficient Transformer inference on commodity edge devices. Code will be released in later version of this work.

*Matīss Kalnāre,Sofoklis Kitharidis,Thomas Bäck,Niki van Stein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adapting mechanistic interpretability techniques from NLP to transformers for time series classification to understand internal decision-making processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models excel in time series classification but their complex internal mechanisms remain poorly understood, with existing explainability methods focusing mainly on input-output relationships.

Method: Applied activation patching, attention saliency, and sparse autoencoders to transformer architectures for time series classification, systematically probing attention heads and timesteps.

Result: Revealed causal structures within models, constructed causal graphs showing information flow, identified key attention heads and temporal positions driving classifications, and demonstrated sparse autoencoders for interpretable features.

Conclusion: Provides methodological advances in transformer interpretability and new insights into functional mechanics of transformers in time series classification.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have become state-of-the-art tools in various machine learning tasks, including time series classification, yet their complexity makes understanding their internal decision-making challenging. Existing explainability methods often focus on input-output attributions, leaving the internal mechanisms largely opaque. This paper addresses this gap by adapting various Mechanistic Interpretability techniques; activation patching, attention saliency, and sparse autoencoders, from NLP to transformer architectures designed explicitly for time series classification. We systematically probe the internal causal roles of individual attention heads and timesteps, revealing causal structures within these models. Through experimentation on a benchmark time series dataset, we construct causal graphs illustrating how information propagates internally, highlighting key attention heads and temporal positions driving correct classifications. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential of sparse autoencoders for uncovering interpretable latent features. Our findings provide both methodological contributions to transformer interpretability and novel insights into the functional mechanics underlying transformer performance in time series classification tasks.

*Jin Pin,Krasowski Hanna,Vanneaux Elena*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A predictive safety shield for model-based RL that uses safe environment simulations to update Q-functions locally, maintaining safety while improving performance without requiring additional training for distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety shields use random safe actions or fixed fallback controllers, disregarding future performance implications of different safe actions.

Method: Proposes a predictive safety shield that updates Q-function locally based on safe predictions from safe simulations of the environment model in discrete spaces.

Result: Experiments on gridworld environments show short prediction horizons can identify optimal paths, and the approach is robust to distribution shifts without additional training.

Conclusion: The predictive safety shield improves performance while maintaining hard safety guarantees and demonstrates robustness to distribution shifts.

Abstract: Obtaining safety guarantees for reinforcement learning is a major challenge to achieve applicability for real-world tasks. Safety shields extend standard reinforcement learning and achieve hard safety guarantees. However, existing safety shields commonly use random sampling of safe actions or a fixed fallback controller, therefore disregarding future performance implications of different safe actions. In this work, we propose a predictive safety shield for model-based reinforcement learning agents in discrete space. Our safety shield updates the Q-function locally based on safe predictions, which originate from a safe simulation of the environment model. This shielding approach improves performance while maintaining hard safety guarantees. Our experiments on gridworld environments demonstrate that even short prediction horizons can be sufficient to identify the optimal path. We observe that our approach is robust to distribution shifts, e.g., between simulation and reality, without requiring additional training.

### [223] [Context-Specific Causal Graph Discovery with Unobserved Contexts: Non-Stationarity, Regimes and Spatio-Temporal Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21537)
*Martin Rabel,Jakob Runge*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for analyzing causal graph changes in non-stationary spatial-temporal data that modifies constraint-based causal discovery methods to handle variations while maintaining stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world spatial-temporal data often violates stationarity assumptions, which can negatively affect causal discovery algorithms and hide important information encoded in variations.

Method: Modifies constraint-based causal discovery approaches at the independence testing level, making it modular and compatible with existing methods like PC, FCI, PCMCI, etc.

Result: Creates an extensible framework that can leverage existing causal discovery methods with minimal changes and systematically addresses subproblems like change-point detection and clustering.

Conclusion: The framework provides a principled approach to handle non-stationarity in causal discovery, with modular design enabling extensions and better understanding of limitations and trade-offs.

Abstract: Real-world data, for example in climate applications, often consists of spatially gridded time series data or data with comparable structure. While the underlying system is often believed to behave similar at different points in space and time, those variations that do exist are twofold relevant: They often encode important information in and of themselves. And they may negatively affect the stability / convergence and reliability\Slash{}validity of results of algorithms assuming stationarity or space-translation invariance. We study the information encoded in changes of the causal graph, with stability in mind. An analysis of this general task identifies two core challenges. We develop guiding principles to overcome these challenges, and provide a framework realizing these principles by modifying constraint-based causal discovery approaches on the level of independence testing. This leads to an extremely modular, easily extensible and widely applicable framework. It can leverage existing constraint-based causal discovery methods (demonstrated on IID-algorithms PC, PC-stable, FCI and time series algorithms PCMCI, PCMCI+, LPCMCI) with little to no modification. The built-in modularity allows to systematically understand and improve upon an entire array of subproblems. By design, it can be extended by leveraging insights from change-point-detection, clustering, independence-testing and other well-studied related problems. The division into more accessible sub-problems also simplifies the understanding of fundamental limitations, hyperparameters controlling trade-offs and the statistical interpretation of results. An open-source implementation will be available soon.

*Jack Geary,Boyan Gao,Henry Gouk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel method for computing best responses in strategic classification using Lagrangian dual optimization, enabling non-linear classifier deployment where previous methods were limited to linear settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Strategic classification faces distribution shifts when deploying classifiers, but current approaches are limited to linear classifiers due to inability to compute best responses in non-linear settings.

Method: Optimizing the Lagrangian dual of the Agents' objective to compute best responses, which works for both linear and non-linear classifier settings.

Result: The method reproduces best responses in linear settings (identifying weaknesses in existing approaches) and can be applied to non-linear settings for evaluation and training.

Conclusion: The proposed Lagrangian dual optimization method enables strategic classification with non-linear classifiers by solving the best response computation problem that previously limited progress.

Abstract: We consider the problem of strategic classification, where the act of deploying a classifier leads to strategic behaviour that induces a distribution shift on subsequent observations. Current approaches to learning classifiers in strategic settings are focused primarily on the linear setting, but in many cases non-linear classifiers are more suitable. A central limitation to progress for non-linear classifiers arises from the inability to compute best responses in these settings. We present a novel method for computing the best response by optimising the Lagrangian dual of the Agents' objective. We demonstrate that our method reproduces best responses in linear settings, identifying key weaknesses in existing approaches. We present further results demonstrating our method can be straight-forwardly applied to non-linear classifier settings, where it is useful for both evaluation and training.

*Wei-Chen Chang,Lu Dai,Ting Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes MSTAN for EHR risk prediction, addressing temporal irregularity and multi-scale dependencies through temporal alignment and multi-scale feature extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges of temporal irregularity, sampling interval differences, and multi-scale dynamic dependencies in Electronic Health Records for accurate risk prediction.

Method: Uses learnable temporal alignment mechanism and multi-scale convolutional feature extraction with temporal embedding, dynamic weighting of irregular data, and attention-based aggregation.

Result: Outperforms mainstream baselines on public EHR datasets in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-Score, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: Provides effective solution for intelligent representation of high-dimensional asynchronous medical sequences and supports EHR-driven clinical risk prediction.

Abstract: This study proposes a risk prediction method based on a Multi-Scale Temporal Alignment Network (MSTAN) to address the challenges of temporal irregularity, sampling interval differences, and multi-scale dynamic dependencies in Electronic Health Records (EHR). The method focuses on temporal feature modeling by introducing a learnable temporal alignment mechanism and a multi-scale convolutional feature extraction structure to jointly model long-term trends and short-term fluctuations in EHR sequences. At the input level, the model maps multi-source clinical features into a unified high-dimensional semantic space and employs temporal embedding and alignment modules to dynamically weight irregularly sampled data, reducing the impact of temporal distribution differences on model performance. The multi-scale feature extraction module then captures key patterns across different temporal granularities through multi-layer convolution and hierarchical fusion, achieving a fine-grained representation of patient states. Finally, an attention-based aggregation mechanism integrates global temporal dependencies to generate individual-level risk representations for disease risk prediction and health status assessment. Experiments conducted on publicly available EHR datasets show that the proposed model outperforms mainstream baselines in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-Score, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of multi-scale temporal alignment in complex medical time-series analysis. This study provides a new solution for intelligent representation of high-dimensional asynchronous medical sequences and offers important technical support for EHR-driven clinical risk prediction.

*Ali Amirahmadi,Gökçe Geylan,Leonardo De Maria,Farzaneh Etminani,Mattias Ohlsson,Alessandro Tibo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposed MD-GAK and PMD-GAK kernels for cyclic peptide permeability prediction, focusing on uncertainty estimation with Gaussian Processes, outperforming state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cell-membrane permeability is a key bottleneck for cyclic peptides targeting intracellular sites, with limited public data and need for well-calibrated uncertainty estimation.

Method: Developed monomer-aware decoupled global alignment kernel (MD-GAK) that couples residue similarity with sequence alignment while decoupling local matches from gap penalties, plus positional variant PMD-GAK with triangular positional prior.

Result: Methods outperform state-of-the-art models across all metrics, with PMD-GAK showing additional advantages in reducing calibration errors.

Conclusion: The proposed kernels provide effective uncertainty estimation for cyclic peptide permeability prediction, offering robust performance with interpretable chemical features.

Abstract: Cyclic peptides are promising modalities for targeting intracellular sites; however, cell-membrane permeability remains a key bottleneck, exacerbated by limited public data and the need for well-calibrated uncertainty. Instead of relying on data-eager complex deep learning architecture, we propose a monomer-aware decoupled global alignment kernel (MD-GAK), which couples chemically meaningful residue-residue similarity with sequence alignment while decoupling local matches from gap penalties. MD-GAK is a relatively simple kernel. To further demonstrate the robustness of our framework, we also introduce a variant, PMD-GAK, which incorporates a triangular positional prior. As we will show in the experimental section, PMD-GAK can offer additional advantages over MD-GAK, particularly in reducing calibration errors. Since our focus is on uncertainty estimation, we use Gaussian Processes as the predictive model, as both MD-GAK and PMD-GAK can be directly applied within this framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods through an extensive set of experiments, comparing our fully reproducible approach against state-of-the-art models, and show that it outperforms them across all metrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Latent reasoning compresses reasoning length by 52% without accuracy loss using adaptive-length models and RL optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce reasoning length and compute usage in Transformer models while maintaining accuracy, moving beyond human language tokens as reasoning medium.

Method: Developed adaptive-length latent reasoning models with post-SFT reinforcement learning to optimize reasoning length while preserving accuracy.

Result: 52% reduction in total reasoning length on Llama 3.2 1B model and GSM8K-Aug dataset with no accuracy penalty.

Conclusion: Latent reasoning effectively compresses reasoning processes and future work will extend to more models, datasets, and architecture variations.

Abstract: Latent reasoning represents a new development in Transformer language models that has shown potential in compressing reasoning lengths compared to chain-of-thought reasoning. By directly passing the information-rich previous final latent state into the next sequence, latent reasoning removes the restriction to human language tokens as the medium for reasoning. We develop adaptive-length latent reasoning models and introduce a post-SFT reinforcement-learning methodology to optimize latent reasoning length by minimizing reasoning length while maintaining accuracy. This, in turn, further reduces compute usage and raises the bar on the compressive capabilities of latent reasoning models. Experiments on the Llama 3.2 1B model and the GSM8K-Aug dataset show a $52\%$ drop in total reasoning length with no penalty to accuracy. In future work, we plan to extend to additional models and datasets, analyze relationships between training coefficients, experiment with architecture variations, and continue our knowledge distillation for latent reasoning SFT efforts. We make our code and pretrained weights available at https://github.com/apning/adaptive-latent-reasoning.

Conclusion: Cloud services provide the optimal backbone for big-data-driven forensic workflows, enabling energy utilities to achieve fast situational awareness and intelligent incident response in smart grid systems.

Abstract: Smart grids are a fusion of classical power infrastructure and advanced communication networks and smart control, to create a cyber-physical environment that is more efficient and flexible than ever before. This integration causes vulnerabilities that can undermine grid stability as well as reliability. Digital forensics is a fundamental concept of learning and identifying, detecting, and mitigating such security incidents. This paper presents an all-in-one machine learning-based digital forensic framework of smart grid systems deployed on the Cloud. The framework combines the data acquisition at the sensor-level, authenticated communication, scalable cloud storage and automated forensic analytics. The model uses supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms - such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosted Trees and deep neural architectures for anomaly detection, event reconstruction and intrusion analysis in real time. After several simulation and experimental studies on real-time smart-meter data streams, the proposed framework is shown to be very accurate, scalable and resilient to cyber-attacks including data tampering, false-data injection and coordinated control-loop manipulation. The results indicate that cloud services are the best backbone for big-data-driven forensic workflows, which allows energy utilities to achieve a fast situational awareness and intelligent incident response.
