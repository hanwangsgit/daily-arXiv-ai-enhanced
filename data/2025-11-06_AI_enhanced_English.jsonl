Although machine learning models\nhave advanced HAR, they are increasingly susceptible to data poisoning attacks\nthat compromise the data integrity and reliability of these systems.\nConventional approaches to defending against such attacks often require\nextensive task-specific training with large, labeled datasets, which limits\nadaptability in dynamic IoT environments. This work proposes a novel framework\nthat uses large language models (LLMs) to perform poisoning detection and\nsanitization in HAR systems, utilizing zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot\nlearning paradigms. Our approach incorporates \\textit{role play} prompting,\nwhereby the LLM assumes the role of expert to contextualize and evaluate sensor\nanomalies, and \\textit{think step-by-step} reasoning, guiding the LLM to infer\npoisoning indicators in the raw sensor data and plausible clean alternatives.\nThese strategies minimize reliance on curation of extensive datasets and enable\nrobust, adaptable defense mechanisms in real-time.

We investigated whether and how Large Language Models (LLMs)\ncan model the correlational structure of human psychological traits from\nminimal quantitative inputs. We prompted various LLMs with Big Five Personality\nScale responses from 816 human individuals to role-play their responses on nine\nother psychological scales. LLMs demonstrated remarkable accuracy in capturing\nhuman psychological structure, with the inter-scale correlation patterns from\nLLM-generated responses strongly aligning with those from human data $(R^2 >\n0.89)$. This zero-shot performance substantially exceeded predictions based on\nsemantic similarity and approached the accuracy of machine learning algorithms\ntrained directly on the dataset. Analysis of reasoning traces revealed that\nLLMs use a systematic two-stage process: First, they transform raw Big Five\nresponses into natural language personality summaries through information\nselection and compression, analogous to generating sufficient statistics.\nSecond, they generate target scale responses based on reasoning from these\nsummaries. For information selection, LLMs identify the same key personality\nfactors as trained algorithms, though they fail to differentiate item\nimportance within factors. The resulting compressed summaries are not merely\nredundant representations but capture synergistic information--adding them to\noriginal scores enhances prediction alignment, suggesting they encode emergent,\nsecond-order patterns of trait interplay.

The key idea is to leverage an implicit\nbehavioral model derived from offline data to provide a behavior-consistency\nsignal during online fine-tuning. BAQ incorporates a dual-objective loss that\n(i) aligns the online policy toward the offline behavior when uncertainty is\nhigh, and (ii) gradually relaxes this constraint as more confident online\nexperience is accumulated. This adaptive mechanism reduces error propagation\nfrom out-of-distribution estimates, stabilizes early online updates, and\naccelerates adaptation to new scenarios. Across standard benchmarks, BAQ\nconsistently outperforms prior offline-to-online RL approaches, achieving\nfaster recovery, improved robustness, and higher overall performance. Our\nresults demonstrate that implicit behavior adaptation is a principled and\npractical solution for reliable real-world policy deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "BAQ enables smooth offline-to-online RL transition by using an implicit behavioral model from offline data to provide behavior-consistency signals during online fine-tuning, adapting constraints based on uncertainty.", "motivation": "Offline RL policies struggle when deployed in dynamic environments due to distributional shift and unreliable value estimates on unseen state-action pairs.", "method": "Behavior-Adaptive Q-Learning (BAQ) uses a dual-objective loss that aligns online policy toward offline behavior when uncertainty is high, and gradually relaxes this constraint as confident online experience accumulates.", "result": "BAQ consistently outperforms prior offline-to-online RL approaches across standard benchmarks, achieving faster recovery, improved robustness, and higher overall performance.", "conclusion": "Implicit behavior adaptation is a principled and practical solution for reliable real-world policy deployment in offline-to-online RL transitions."}}

Under Review", "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a\npowerful paradigm for post-training large reasoning models (LRMs) using\npolicy-gradient methods such as GRPO. To stabilize training, these methods\ntypically center trajectory rewards by subtracting the empirical mean for each\nprompt. Statistically, this centering acts as a control variate (or baseline),\nreducing the variance of the policy-gradient estimator.\n  Typically, the mean reward is estimated using per-prompt empirical averages\nfor each prompt in a batch. Drawing inspiration from Stein's paradox, we\npropose using shrinkage estimators that combine per-prompt and across-prompt\nmeans to improve the overall per-prompt mean estimation accuracy --\nparticularly in the low-generation regime typical of RLVR. Theoretically, we\nconstruct a shrinkage-based baseline that provably yields lower-variance\npolicy-gradient estimators across algorithms. Our proposed baseline serves as a\ndrop-in replacement for existing per-prompt mean baselines, requiring no\nadditional hyper-parameters or computation.
