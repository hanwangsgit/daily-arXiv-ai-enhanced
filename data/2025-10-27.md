### [1] [Anisotropic Pooling for LUT-realizable CNN Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21437)
*Xi Zhang,Xiaolin Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes anisotropic pooling methods to replace average pooling in LUT-based CNN image restoration, improving performance by better handling anisotropic signal structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LUT-based CNN methods use average pooling for fusion, which is ill-suited for anisotropic signal structures and limits performance.

Method: Introduces generalized median pooling and learns data-dependent pooling coefficients for each orientation to adaptively weigh contributions from differently oriented pixel patches.

Result: Experimental results show both perceptually and numerically superior performance compared to existing LUT-realizable CNN methods on various restoration benchmarks.

Conclusion: Anisotropic pooling strategies effectively improve LUT-based CNN restoration by better managing table size while handling anisotropic structures, outperforming current methods.

Abstract: Table look-up realization of image restoration CNNs has the potential of
achieving competitive image quality while being much faster and resource frugal
than the straightforward CNN implementation. The main technical challenge
facing the LUT-based CNN algorithm designers is to manage the table size
without overly restricting the receptive field. The prevailing strategy is to
reuse the table for small pixel patches of different orientations (apparently
assuming a degree of isotropy) and then fuse the look-up results. The fusion is
currently done by average pooling, which we find being ill suited to
anisotropic signal structures. To alleviate the problem, we investigate and
discuss anisotropic pooling methods to replace naive averaging for improving
the performance of the current LUT-realizable CNN restoration methods. First,
we introduce the method of generalized median pooling which leads to measurable
gains over average pooling. We then extend this idea by learning data-dependent
pooling coefficients for each orientation, so that they can adaptively weigh
the contributions of differently oriented pixel patches. Experimental results
on various restoration benchmarks show that our anisotropic pooling strategy
yields both perceptually and numerically superior results compared to existing
LUT-realizable CNN methods.

### [2] [Preventing Shortcuts in Adapter Training via Providing the Shortcuts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20887)
*Anujraaj Argo Goyal,Guocheng Gordon Qian,Huseyin Coskun,Aarush Gupta,Himmy Tam,Daniil Ostashev,Ju Hu,Dhritiman Sagar,Sergey Tulyakov,Kfir Aberman,Kuan-Chieh Jackson Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training improves text-to-image generation by routing confounding factors through auxiliary modules during training, then removing them during inference to prevent attribute entanglement and enhance prompt adherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapter training for image generators often entangles target attributes with incidental factors like pose and lighting, limiting generalization and prompt adherence. The paper aims to solve this spurious correlation problem.

Method: Proposes Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training where confounding factors are routed through auxiliary modules (ControlNet or LoRA) during training, eliminating the incentive for the adapter to internalize them. These auxiliary modules are removed during inference.

Result: When applied to facial and full-body identity injection tasks, the approach improves generation quality, diversity, and prompt adherence compared to standard adapter training methods.

Conclusion: The work establishes a general design principle: when seeking disentangled representations, the most effective approach is to create shortcuts for what should NOT be learned, rather than trying to prevent learning of unwanted factors.

Abstract: Adapter-based training has emerged as a key mechanism for extending the
capabilities of powerful foundation image generators, enabling personalized and
stylized text-to-image synthesis. These adapters are typically trained to
capture a specific target attribute, such as subject identity, using
single-image reconstruction objectives. However, because the input image
inevitably contains a mixture of visual factors, adapters are prone to entangle
the target attribute with incidental ones, such as pose, expression, and
lighting. This spurious correlation problem limits generalization and obstructs
the model's ability to adhere to the input text prompt. In this work, we
uncover a simple yet effective solution: provide the very shortcuts we wish to
eliminate during adapter training. In Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training,
confounding factors are routed through auxiliary modules, such as ControlNet or
LoRA, eliminating the incentive for the adapter to internalize them. The
auxiliary modules are then removed during inference. When applied to tasks like
facial and full-body identity injection, our approach improves generation
quality, diversity, and prompt adherence. These results point to a general
design principle in the era of large models: when seeking disentangled
representations, the most effective path may be to establish shortcuts for what
should NOT be learned.

### [3] [Video-As-Prompt: Unified Semantic Control for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20888)
*Yuxuan Bian,Xin Chen,Zenan Li,Tiancheng Zhi,Shen Sang,Linjie Luo,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-As-Prompt (VAP) introduces a new paradigm for semantic video control using reference videos as prompts with a Mixture-of-Transformers expert, achieving state-of-the-art performance without task-specific finetuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing methods that either introduce artifacts through pixel-wise priors or require non-generalizable, condition-specific finetuning for semantic video control.

Method: Uses reference videos as semantic prompts with a plug-and-play Mixture-of-Transformers expert on frozen Video Diffusion Transformer, guided by temporally biased position embedding to eliminate spurious mapping priors.

Result: Achieves 38.7% user preference rate, rivaling leading condition-specific commercial models, with strong zero-shot generalization across various downstream applications.

Conclusion: VAP represents a significant advance toward general-purpose, controllable video generation through its unified approach and strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Unified, generalizable semantic control in video generation remains a
critical open challenge. Existing methods either introduce artifacts by
enforcing inappropriate pixel-wise priors from structure-based controls, or
rely on non-generalizable, condition-specific finetuning or task-specific
architectures. We introduce Video-As-Prompt (VAP), a new paradigm that reframes
this problem as in-context generation. VAP leverages a reference video as a
direct semantic prompt, guiding a frozen Video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) via
a plug-and-play Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) expert. This architecture
prevents catastrophic forgetting and is guided by a temporally biased position
embedding that eliminates spurious mapping priors for robust context retrieval.
To power this approach and catalyze future research, we built VAP-Data, the
largest dataset for semantic-controlled video generation with over 100K paired
videos across 100 semantic conditions. As a single unified model, VAP sets a
new state-of-the-art for open-source methods, achieving a 38.7% user preference
rate that rivals leading condition-specific commercial models. VAP's strong
zero-shot generalization and support for various downstream applications mark a
significant advance toward general-purpose, controllable video generation.

### [4] [Focal Modulation and Bidirectional Feature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20933)
*Moin Safdar,Shahzaib Iqbal,Mehwish Mehmood,Mubeen Ghafoor,Tariq M. Khan,Imran Razzak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FM-BFF-Net combines CNNs and transformers with focal modulation attention and bidirectional feature fusion to improve medical image segmentation by capturing global context and enhancing boundary precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical applications, but CNNs struggle with global context and long-range dependencies, limiting their ability to segment complex structures with varying sizes and borders.

Method: Proposes FM-BFF-Net that integrates convolutional and transformer components, uses focal modulation attention mechanism for context refinement, and introduces bidirectional feature fusion module for efficient encoder-decoder interaction across scales.

Result: Extensive experiments on eight public datasets (polyp detection, skin lesion segmentation, ultrasound imaging) show FM-BFF-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in Jaccard index and Dice coefficient.

Conclusion: FM-BFF-Net effectively addresses limitations of CNNs in medical image segmentation, demonstrating enhanced boundary precision and robustness to lesion variations across diverse medical imaging scenarios.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is essential for clinical applications such as
disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease development monitoring
because it provides precise morphological and spatial information on anatomical
structures that directly influence treatment decisions. Convolutional neural
networks significantly impact image segmentation; however, since convolution
operations are local, capturing global contextual information and long-range
dependencies is still challenging. Their capacity to precisely segment
structures with complicated borders and a variety of sizes is impacted by this
restriction. Since transformers use self-attention methods to capture global
context and long-range dependencies efficiently, integrating transformer-based
architecture with CNNs is a feasible approach to overcoming these challenges.
To address these challenges, we propose the Focal Modulation and Bidirectional
Feature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation, referred to as
FM-BFF-Net in the remainder of this paper. The network combines convolutional
and transformer components, employs a focal modulation attention mechanism to
refine context awareness, and introduces a bidirectional feature fusion module
that enables efficient interaction between encoder and decoder representations
across scales. Through this design, FM-BFF-Net enhances boundary precision and
robustness to variations in lesion size, shape, and contrast. Extensive
experiments on eight publicly available datasets, including polyp detection,
skin lesion segmentation, and ultrasound imaging, show that FM-BFF-Net
consistently surpasses recent state-of-the-art methods in Jaccard index and
Dice coefficient, confirming its effectiveness and adaptability for diverse
medical imaging scenarios.

### [5] [Generative Point Tracking with Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20951)
*Mattie Tesfaldet,Adam W. Harley,Konstantinos G. Derpanis,Derek Nowrouzezahrai,Christopher Pal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenPT is a generative framework for multi-modal point tracking that captures trajectory uncertainty through flow matching, outperforming discriminative models on occluded points while maintaining competitive visible point tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current discriminative point trackers fail to capture multi-modality in trajectories and only regress to mean/mode estimates when faced with uncertainty from occlusions and appearance changes.

Method: Uses generative flow matching formulation with iterative refinement, window-dependent prior for consistency, and coordinate-specific variance schedule. Employs best-first search on generated samples during inference guided by model confidence.

Result: State-of-the-art tracking accuracy on occluded points in PointOdyssey, Dynamic Replica, TAP-Vid benchmarks, while maintaining competitive performance on visible points. Introduced occluded TAP-Vid variant to demonstrate multi-modal capability.

Conclusion: GenPT successfully captures multi-modality in point trajectories, providing superior performance for occluded tracking compared to discriminative approaches, addressing key limitations in point tracking uncertainty.

Abstract: Tracking a point through a video can be a challenging task due to uncertainty
arising from visual obfuscations, such as appearance changes and occlusions.
Although current state-of-the-art discriminative models excel in regressing
long-term point trajectory estimates -- even through occlusions -- they are
limited to regressing to a mean (or mode) in the presence of uncertainty, and
fail to capture multi-modality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
Generative Point Tracker (GenPT), a generative framework for modelling
multi-modal trajectories. GenPT is trained with a novel flow matching
formulation that combines the iterative refinement of discriminative trackers,
a window-dependent prior for cross-window consistency, and a variance schedule
tuned specifically for point coordinates. We show how our model's generative
capabilities can be leveraged to improve point trajectory estimates by
utilizing a best-first search strategy on generated samples during inference,
guided by the model's own confidence of its predictions. Empirically, we
evaluate GenPT against the current state of the art on the standard
PointOdyssey, Dynamic Replica, and TAP-Vid benchmarks. Further, we introduce a
TAP-Vid variant with additional occlusions to assess occluded point tracking
performance and highlight our model's ability to capture multi-modality. GenPT
is capable of capturing the multi-modality in point trajectories, which
translates to state-of-the-art tracking accuracy on occluded points, while
maintaining competitive tracking accuracy on visible points compared to extant
discriminative point trackers.

*Sraavya Sambara,Sung Eun Kim,Xiaoman Zhang,Luyang Luo,Shreya Johri,Mohammed Baharoon,Du Hyun Ro,Pranav Rajpurkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DReasonKnee is the first 3D grounded reasoning dataset for medical images, providing 494k expert-annotated quintuples from knee MRI volumes to enable VLMs to perform anatomical localization and step-by-step diagnostic reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle to ground anatomical regions in 3D medical images and perform step-by-step reasoning, which is essential for aligning with clinical diagnostic workflows and enabling trustworthy clinician-AI collaboration.

Method: Created 3DReasonKnee dataset with 494k quintuples from 7,970 3D knee MRI volumes, each containing: 3D MRI volume, diagnostic question, 3D bounding box localization, clinician-generated reasoning steps, and structured severity assessments. Involved 450+ hours of expert clinician time for manual segmentation and reasoning chain generation.

Result: Established ReasonKnee-Bench evaluation framework and benchmarked five state-of-the-art VLMs, providing baseline performance for localization and diagnostic accuracy across anatomical regions.

Conclusion: 3DReasonKnee serves as both a repository of orthopedic surgeons' diagnostic expertise and a vital testbed for advancing multimodal medical AI systems towards 3D, clinically aligned, localized decision-making capabilities.

Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to ground anatomical regions
in 3D medical images and reason about them in a step-by-step manner, a key
requirement of real-world diagnostic assessment. This ability is essential for
aligning model outputs with the diagnostic workflows clinicians use in
practice, enabling trustworthy clinician-AI collaboration. Existing 3D datasets
provide localization labels, but none support this "grounded reasoning"
ability. To address this gap, we introduce 3DReasonKnee, the first 3D grounded
reasoning dataset for medical images, which provides 494k high-quality
quintuples derived from 7,970 3D knee MRI volumes. Each quintuple includes: (1)
the 3D MRI volume, (2) a diagnostic question targeting a specific anatomical
region (3) a 3D bounding box localizing the relevant anatomical structures, (4)
clinician-generated diagnostic reasoning steps that explicitly detail the 3D
reasoning process, and (5) structured severity assessments for the relevant
anatomical region. The creation and validation of 3DReasonKnee, involving over
450 hours of expert clinician time for manually segmenting MRIs and generating
reasoning chains, ensures its superior quality and clinical relevance. We
establish ReasonKnee-Bench to evaluate localization and diagnostic accuracy,
providing insight into VLM ability to perform grounding and severity assessment
across anatomical regions and diagnostic inquiries. We benchmark five
state-of-the-art VLMs, providing baseline performance for ReasonKnee-Bench. By
providing this unique resource of expert-annotated 3D reasoning pathways,
3DReasonKnee serves as a repository of orthopedic surgeons' diagnostic
expertise and offers a vital testbed for advancing multimodal medical AI
systems towards 3D, clinically aligned, localized decision-making capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the ambiguities in visible polarization analyses and enable 3D reconstruction that is independent of illumination conditions and material properties.

Method: Uses long-wave infrared (LWIR) polarimetric imaging and multi-view thermal polarimetric images to reconstruct 3D shapes, formulating a general theory of polarization observation.

Result: Successfully reconstructs fine details in transparent, translucent, and heterogeneous objects, outperforming existing techniques.

Conclusion: Thermal polarization-based 3D reconstruction provides a robust solution that works across various material types and is unaffected by illumination variations.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for detailed 3D shape reconstruction
utilizing thermal polarization cues. Unlike state-of-the-art methods, the
proposed approach is independent of illumination and material properties. In
this paper, we formulate a general theory of polarization observation and show
that long-wave infrared (LWIR) polarimetric imaging is free from the
ambiguities that affect visible polarization analyses. Subsequently, we propose
a method for recovering detailed 3D shapes using multi-view thermal
polarimetric images. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
effectively reconstructs fine details in transparent, translucent, and
heterogeneous objects, outperforming existing techniques.

### [8] [VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for Visual Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20994)
*Jesimon Barreto,Carlos Caetano,André Araujo,William Robson Schwartz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VESSA is a self-supervised adaptation method for vision foundation models that uses multi-view object-centric videos without annotations to improve performance in domains with distribution shifts and scarce labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision foundation models often underperform in domains with distribution shifts and limited labeled data, and traditional self-supervised learning hasn't been effective for visual encoder models.

Method: Uses self-distillation paradigm with multi-view object-centric videos, carefully tuning prediction heads and deploying parameter-efficient adaptation techniques to prevent forgetting pretrained knowledge.

Result: Consistent improvements in downstream classification tasks across 3 vision foundation models on 2 datasets, outperforming base models and previous adaptation methods.

Conclusion: VESSA successfully enables vision foundation models to adapt to new domains using only unlabeled object-centric videos, addressing the challenge of distribution shifts without requiring annotations.

Abstract: Foundation models have advanced computer vision by enabling strong
performance across diverse tasks through large-scale pretraining and supervised
fine-tuning. However, they may underperform in domains with distribution shifts
and scarce labels, where supervised fine-tuning may be infeasible. While
continued self-supervised learning for model adaptation is common for
generative language models, this strategy has not proven effective for
vision-centric encoder models. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel
formulation of self-supervised fine-tuning for vision foundation models, where
the model is adapted to a new domain without requiring annotations, leveraging
only short multi-view object-centric videos. Our method is referred to as
VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for visual
foundation models. VESSA's training technique is based on a self-distillation
paradigm, where it is critical to carefully tune prediction heads and deploy
parameter-efficient adaptation techniques - otherwise, the model may quickly
forget its pretrained knowledge and reach a degraded state. VESSA benefits
significantly from multi-view object observations sourced from different frames
in an object-centric video, efficiently learning robustness to varied capture
conditions, without the need of annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
with 3 vision foundation models on 2 datasets, VESSA demonstrates consistent
improvements in downstream classification tasks, compared to the base models
and previous adaptation methods. Code is publicly available at

*Jiaqi Hu,Hongli Xu,Junwen Huang,Peter KT Yu,Slobodan Ilic,Benjamin Busam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A plug-in pipeline for 2D detection of unseen objects in industrial settings that enhances detection accuracy under challenging conditions like clutter and poor lighting, with minimal inference overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 6D pose estimation pipelines degrade under industrial challenges like clutter, poor lighting, and complex backgrounds, making detection the critical bottleneck that needs improvement.

Method: Uses low-light image enhancement and background removal guided by open-vocabulary detection with foundation models, building on SOTA baselines to reduce domain shift and suppress false positives from raw SAM outputs.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world industrial bin-picking benchmarks from BOP show significant boost in detection accuracy with negligible inference overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective and practical for improving detection reliability in industrial 6D pose estimation pipelines.

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation is essential for robotic manipulation in
industrial environments. Existing pipelines typically rely on off-the-shelf
object detectors followed by cropping and pose refinement, but their
performance degrades under challenging conditions such as clutter, poor
lighting, and complex backgrounds, making detection the critical bottleneck. In
this work, we introduce a standardized and plug-in pipeline for 2D detection of
unseen objects in industrial settings. Based on current SOTA baselines, our
approach reduces domain shift and background artifacts through low-light image
enhancement and background removal guided by open-vocabulary detection with
foundation models. This design suppresses the false positives prevalent in raw
SAM outputs, yielding more reliable detections for downstream pose estimation.
Extensive experiments on real-world industrial bin-picking benchmarks from BOP
demonstrate that our method significantly boosts detection accuracy while
incurring negligible inference overhead, showing the effectiveness and
practicality of the proposed method.

### [10] [Deep learning-based automated damage detection in concrete structures using images from earthquake events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21063)
*Abdullah Turer,Yongsheng Bai,Halil Sezen,Alper Yilmaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a deep learning-based framework for automated structural damage assessment using images from the 2023 Turkey Earthquakes, focusing on detecting exposed steel reinforcement as indicators of damage severity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Timely assessment of structural integrity after seismic events is crucial for public safety and emergency response, requiring automated methods to detect damage indicators like exposed steel reinforcement.

Method: Developed a hybrid deep learning framework using YOLOv11 models for detecting cracking, spalling, and exposed steel bars, with fine-tuning, data augmentation, and classification of structural components and damage levels.

Result: The proposed method successfully detects exposed steel reinforcement and classifies structural damage levels automatically from input images, demonstrating reliable damage assessment capabilities.

Conclusion: Rapid and automated damage detection following disasters is achievable through image data collection, annotation, and deep learning approaches across diverse damage contexts.

Abstract: Timely assessment of integrity of structures after seismic events is crucial
for public safety and emergency response. This study focuses on assessing the
structural damage conditions using deep learning methods to detect exposed
steel reinforcement in concrete buildings and bridges after large earthquakes.
Steel bars are typically exposed after concrete spalling or large flexural or
shear cracks. The amount and distribution of exposed steel reinforcement is an
indication of structural damage and degradation. To automatically detect
exposed steel bars, new datasets of images collected after the 2023 Turkey
Earthquakes were labeled to represent a wide variety of damaged concrete
structures. The proposed method builds upon a deep learning framework, enhanced
with fine-tuning, data augmentation, and testing on public datasets. An
automated classification framework is developed that can be used to identify
inside/outside buildings and structural components. Then, a YOLOv11 (You Only
Look Once) model is trained to detect cracking and spalling damage and exposed
bars. Another YOLO model is finetuned to distinguish different categories of
structural damage levels. All these trained models are used to create a hybrid
framework to automatically and reliably determine the damage levels from input
images. This research demonstrates that rapid and automated damage detection
following disasters is achievable across diverse damage contexts by utilizing
image data collection, annotation, and deep learning approaches.

### [11] [ZING-3D: Zero-shot Incremental 3D Scene Graphs via Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21069)
*Pranav Saxena,Jimmy Chiun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ZING-3D is a zero-shot framework that generates 3D scene graphs using pretrained foundation models, enabling open-vocabulary recognition, incremental updates, and geometric grounding for robotics applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D scene graph generation methods are limited to single-view settings, lack incremental update capabilities, and don't provide explicit geometric grounding in 3D space, which are essential for embodied scenarios and robotics applications.

Method: Leverages VLM reasoning to generate rich 2D scene graphs, then grounds them in 3D using depth information. Nodes represent open-vocabulary objects with features, 3D locations, and semantic context, while edges capture spatial and semantic relations with inter-object distances.

Result: Experiments on Replica and HM3D datasets show ZING-3D effectively captures spatial and relational knowledge without task-specific training.

Conclusion: ZING-3D provides a zero-shot solution for generating geometrically grounded 3D scene graphs with incremental update capabilities, making it suitable for downstream robotics applications.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about complex 3D environments requires structured
scene representations that capture not only objects but also their semantic and
spatial relationships. While recent works on 3D scene graph generation have
leveraged pretrained VLMs without task-specific fine-tuning, they are largely
confined to single-view settings, fail to support incremental updates as new
observations arrive and lack explicit geometric grounding in 3D space, all of
which are essential for embodied scenarios. In this paper, we propose, ZING-3D,
a framework that leverages the vast knowledge of pretrained foundation models
to enable open-vocabulary recognition and generate a rich semantic
representation of the scene in a zero-shot manner while also enabling
incremental updates and geometric grounding in 3D space, making it suitable for
downstream robotics applications. Our approach leverages VLM reasoning to
generate a rich 2D scene graph, which is grounded in 3D using depth
information. Nodes represent open-vocabulary objects with features, 3D
locations, and semantic context, while edges capture spatial and semantic
relations with inter-object distances. Our experiments on scenes from the
Replica and HM3D dataset show that ZING-3D is effective at capturing spatial
and relational knowledge without the need of task-specific training.

### [12] [WaveSeg: Enhancing Segmentation Precision via High-Frequency Prior and Mamba-Driven Spectrum Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21079)
*Guoan Xu,Yang Xiao,Wenjing Jia,Guangwei Gao,Guo-Jun Qi,Chia-Wen Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaveSeg is a novel decoder architecture for semantic segmentation that jointly optimizes feature refinement in spatial and wavelet domains using wavelet-domain frequency priors and Mamba-based attention to improve boundary details and semantic context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most semantic segmentation networks rely on powerful pretrained encoders but use simplistic decoders, resulting in suboptimal trade-offs between semantic context and fine-grained detail preservation.

Method: Proposes WaveSeg decoder with: 1) Learning high-frequency components as explicit priors for boundary details; 2) Dual Domain Operation (DDO) for multi-scale fusion; 3) Spectrum Decomposition Attention (SDA) block using Mamba's linear-complexity long-range modeling; 4) Reparameterized convolutions for low-frequency semantic integrity; 5) Residual-guided fusion for multi-scale feature integration.

Result: Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show WaveSeg consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively, achieving efficient and precise segmentation.

Conclusion: WaveSeg demonstrates that leveraging wavelet-domain frequency priors with Mamba-based attention enables superior semantic segmentation performance by better preserving both semantic context and fine-grained structural details.

Abstract: While recent semantic segmentation networks heavily rely on powerful
pretrained encoders, most employ simplistic decoders, leading to suboptimal
trade-offs between semantic context and fine-grained detail preservation. To
address this, we propose a novel decoder architecture, WaveSeg, which jointly
optimizes feature refinement in spatial and wavelet domains. Specifically,
high-frequency components are first learned from input images as explicit
priors to reinforce boundary details at early stages. A multi-scale fusion
mechanism, Dual Domain Operation (DDO), is then applied, and the novel Spectrum
Decomposition Attention (SDA) block is proposed, which is developed to leverage
Mamba's linear-complexity long-range modeling to enhance high-frequency
structural details. Meanwhile, reparameterized convolutions are applied to
preserve low-frequency semantic integrity in the wavelet domain. Finally, a
residual-guided fusion integrates multi-scale features with boundary-aware
representations at native resolution, producing semantically and structurally
rich feature maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
that WaveSeg, leveraging wavelet-domain frequency prior with Mamba-based
attention, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both
quantitatively and qualitatively, achieving efficient and precise segmentation.

### [13] [Knowledge-Driven Vision-Language Model for Plexus Detection in Hirschsprung's Disease](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21083)
*Youssef Megahed,Atallah Madi,Dina El Demellawy,Adrian D. C. Chan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework integrating expert-derived textual concepts with vision-language models for Hirschsprung's disease classification, outperforming traditional CNN models by aligning clinical semantic cues with visual features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deep learning approaches for Hirschsprung's disease classification are black boxes that don't align with physician decision-making processes and lack interpretability.

Method: Integrates expert-derived textual concepts from medical sources into a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training-based vision-language model, using LLM-generated prompts reviewed by experts and encoded with QuiltNet.

Result: Achieved 83.9% accuracy, 86.6% precision, and 87.6% specificity, outperforming CNN-based models including VGG-19, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50.

Conclusion: Multi-modal learning with expert knowledge integration shows strong potential for histopathology, providing more clinically relevant and interpretable model outputs.

Abstract: Hirschsprung's disease is defined as the congenital absence of ganglion cells
in some segment(s) of the colon. The muscle cannot make coordinated movements
to propel stool in that section, most commonly leading to obstruction. The
diagnosis and treatment for this disease require a clear identification of
different region(s) of the myenteric plexus, where ganglion cells should be
present, on the microscopic view of the tissue slide. While deep learning
approaches, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, have performed very well in
this task, they are often treated as black boxes, with minimal understanding
gained from them, and may not conform to how a physician makes decisions. In
this study, we propose a novel framework that integrates expert-derived textual
concepts into a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training-based vision-language
model to guide plexus classification. Using prompts derived from expert sources
(e.g., medical textbooks and papers) generated by large language models and
reviewed by our team before being encoded with QuiltNet, our approach aligns
clinically relevant semantic cues with visual features. Experimental results
show that the proposed model demonstrated superior discriminative capability
across different classification metrics as it outperformed CNN-based models,
including VGG-19, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50; achieving an accuracy of 83.9%, a
precision of 86.6%, and a specificity of 87.6%. These findings highlight the
potential of multi-modal learning in histopathology and underscore the value of
incorporating expert knowledge for more clinically relevant model outputs.

*Jingtian Zhao,Xueli Xie,Jianxiang Xi,Xiaogang Yang,Haoxuan Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HistRetinex extends Retinex model to histogram domain for fast low-light image enhancement, achieving better results than existing methods while being significantly faster.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Retinex-based methods are time-consuming for large-sized images, creating a need for faster enhancement approaches.

Method: Proposes histogram-based Retinex model using histogram location/count matrices, constructs two-level optimization model, and enhances images through histogram matching.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in visibility and performance metrics, executes in 1.86 seconds on 1000*664 images (6.67 seconds faster than minimum competitor).

Conclusion: HistRetinex provides an efficient and effective solution for fast low-light image enhancement with superior performance.

Abstract: Retinex-based low-light image enhancement methods are widely used due to
their excellent performance. However, most of them are time-consuming for
large-sized images. This paper extends the Retinex model from the spatial
domain to the histogram domain, and proposes a novel histogram-based Retinex
model for fast low-light image enhancement, named HistRetinex. Firstly, we
define the histogram location matrix and the histogram count matrix, which
establish the relationship among histograms of the illumination, reflectance
and the low-light image. Secondly, based on the prior information and the
histogram-based Retinex model, we construct a novel two-level optimization
model. Through solving the optimization model, we give the iterative formulas
of the illumination histogram and the reflectance histogram, respectively.
Finally, we enhance the low-light image through matching its histogram with the
one provided by HistRetinex. Experimental results demonstrate that the
HistRetinex outperforms existing enhancement methods in both visibility and
performance metrics, while executing 1.86 seconds on 1000*664 resolution
images, achieving a minimum time saving of 6.67 seconds.

*Weijie Zhou,Xuantang Xiong,Yi Peng,Manli Tao,Chaoyang Zhao,Honghui Dong,Ming Tang,Jinqiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Active Visual Reasoning (AVR), extending visual reasoning to partially observable environments where agents must actively gather information through physical actions, integrate multi-step observations, and adapt decisions based on visual feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs are limited to static, fully observable settings, while real-world environments often have incomplete information due to occlusion or limited field of view. Humans actively explore environments through perception-reasoning-action loops.

Method: Created CLEVR-AVR benchmark with multi-round interactive environments, AVR-152k dataset with Chain-of-Thought annotations, and developed PhysVLM-AVR model that handles uncertainty identification, action-conditioned information gain prediction, and information-maximizing action selection.

Result: PhysVLM-AVR achieves state-of-the-art performance on CLEVR-AVR, embodied reasoning (OpenEQA, RoboVQA), and passive visual reasoning (GeoMath, Geometry30K). Analysis shows current embodied MLLMs struggle with active information acquisition and integration.

Conclusion: Active visual reasoning requires closed-loop perception-reasoning-action integration, and current MLLMs have fundamental gaps in actively acquiring and integrating new information through interaction, highlighting the need for improved active reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has primarily
been studied in static, fully observable settings, limiting their effectiveness
in real-world environments where information is often incomplete due to
occlusion or limited field of view. Humans, in contrast, actively explore and
interact with their environment-moving, examining, and manipulating objects-to
gather information through a closed-loop process integrating perception,
reasoning, and action. Inspired by this human capability, we introduce the
Active Visual Reasoning (AVR) task, extending visual reasoning to partially
observable, interactive environments. AVR necessitates agents to: (1) actively
acquire information via sequential physical actions, (2) integrate observations
across multiple steps for coherent reasoning, and (3) dynamically adjust
decisions based on evolving visual feedback. To rigorously evaluate AVR, we
introduce CLEVR-AVR, a simulation benchmark featuring multi-round interactive
environments designed to assess both reasoning correctness and
information-gathering efficiency. We present AVR-152k, a large-scale dataset
that offers rich Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations detailing iterative
reasoning for uncertainty identification, action-conditioned information gain
prediction, and information-maximizing action selection, crucial for training
agents in a higher-order Markov Decision Process. Building on this, we develop
PhysVLM-AVR, an MLLM achieving state-of-the-art performance on CLEVR-AVR,
embodied reasoning (OpenEQA, RoboVQA), and passive visual reasoning (GeoMath,
Geometry30K). Our analysis also reveals that current embodied MLLMs, despite
detecting information incompleteness, struggle to actively acquire and
integrate new information through interaction, highlighting a fundamental gap
in active reasoning capabilities.

*Hezam Albagami,Haitian Wang,Xinyu Wang,Muhammad Ibrahim,Zainy M. Malakan,Abdullah M. Alqamdi,Mohammed H. Alghamdi,Ajmal Mian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An object-centric, uncertainty-aware pipeline for 3D change detection in city-scale LiDAR data that handles alignment, height normalization, and cross-epoch object association while preserving class counts and managing splits/merges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D city map change detection are sensitive to alignment errors, degrade thin structures, lack object identity, and don't handle uncertainty or split/merge cases effectively.

Method: Multi-resolution NDT alignment followed by point-to-plane ICP, height normalization, uncertainty estimation from registration covariance and surface roughness, geometry-based cross-epoch associations refined by semantic/instance segmentation, and class-constrained bipartite assignment with dummy augmentation.

Result: Achieves 95.2% accuracy, 90.4% mF1, and 82.6% mIoU on 15 Subiaco blocks, outperforming Triplet KPConv with largest gains on 'Decreased' class where IoU reaches 74.8% (7.6 point improvement).

Conclusion: The proposed uncertainty-aware, object-centric pipeline effectively handles city-scale LiDAR change detection with robust performance across various change types and improved handling of split/merge cases.

Abstract: High-definition 3D city maps underpin smart transportation, digital twins,
and autonomous driving, where object level change detection across bi temporal
LiDAR enables HD map maintenance, construction monitoring, and reliable
localization. Classical DSM differencing and image based methods are sensitive
to small vertical bias, ground slope, and viewpoint mismatch and yield cellwise
outputs without object identity. Point based neural models and voxel encodings
demand large memory, assume near perfect pre alignment, degrade thin
structures, and seldom enforce class consistent association, which leaves split
or merge cases unresolved and ignores uncertainty. We propose an object
centric, uncertainty aware pipeline for city scale LiDAR that aligns epochs
with multi resolution NDT followed by point to plane ICP, normalizes height,
and derives a per location level of detection from registration covariance and
surface roughness to calibrate decisions and suppress spurious changes.
Geometry only proxies seed cross epoch associations that are refined by
semantic and instance segmentation and a class constrained bipartite assignment
with augmented dummies to handle splits and merges while preserving per class
counts. Tiled processing bounds memory without eroding narrow ground changes,
and instance level decisions combine 3D overlap, normal direction displacement,
and height and volume differences with a histogram distance, all gated by the
local level of detection to remain stable under partial overlap and sampling
variation. On 15 representative Subiaco blocks the method attains 95.2%
accuracy, 90.4% mF1, and 82.6% mIoU, exceeding Triplet KPConv by 0.2 percentage
points in accuracy, 0.2 in mF1, and 0.8 in mIoU, with the largest gain on
Decreased where IoU reaches 74.8% and improves by 7.6 points.

*Yanguang Sun,Jiawei Lian,Jian Yang,Lei Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Controllable-LPMoE is a dynamic priors-based fine-tuning method that adaptively modulates frozen foundation models using local priors for efficient object segmentation with fewer trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full-parameter fine-tuning of large foundation models causes significant computational overhead, while existing prompt-based methods lack semantic priors, limiting model adaptability.

Method: Uses a lightweight dynamic mixed local priors extractor with heterogeneous convolutions and gating network, plus a bi-directional interaction adapter with cosine-aligned deformable attention and channel-oriented adaptive scale enhancement.

Result: Demonstrates excellent segmentation performance compared to 31 state-of-the-art methods and adapts well to multiple binary object segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed Controllable-LPMoE achieves efficient fine-tuning with superior segmentation performance while maintaining computational efficiency through dynamic local priors control.

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models provide powerful feature representations for
downstream object segmentation tasks. However, when adapted to specific tasks
through the full-parameter fine-tuning, the enormous parameters being updated
often results in significant computational overhead, creating a bottleneck in
training efficiency. Although existing methods attempt to fine-tune frozen
models by directly embedding trainable prompts, these prompts lack inherent
semantic priors, limiting the adaptability of large-scale models. In this
paper, we propose a novel dynamic priors-based fine-tuning paradigm with fewer
trainable parameters, dubbed Controllable-LPMoE, which adaptively modulates
frozen foundation models by dynamically controlling local priors to enhance
fine-grained perception for specific segmentation tasks. More specifically, we
construct a lightweight dynamic mixed local priors extractor that captures
diverse local priors from input images through heterogeneous convolutions while
employing a gating network to dynamically output expert priors required for the
subsequent fine-tuning. Furthermore, we design a bi-directional interaction
adapter that employs cosine-aligned deformable attention and channel-oriented
adaptive scale enhancement to interact and restructure between frozen and
trainable features, achieving efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our
\href{https://github.com/CSYSI/Controllable-LPMoE} {Controllable-LPMoE}
approach, demonstrating excellent segmentation performance compared to 31
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and adaptability to multiple binary object
segmentation tasks.

*Alec Helbling,Shruti Palaskar,Kundan Krishna,Polo Chau,Leon Gatys,Joseph Yitan Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SafetyPairs is a framework for generating counterfactual image pairs that differ only in safety-relevant features, enabling fine-grained analysis of image safety distinctions and improving model evaluation and training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image safety datasets are coarse and ambiguous, lacking isolation of specific features that determine safety. Subtle changes like gestures or symbols can drastically alter safety implications, but current datasets don't capture these fine-grained differences.

Method: Leveraging image editing models to make targeted changes that alter safety labels while preserving safety-irrelevant details. Creates counterfactual pairs where only safety-relevant features differ, flipping the safety label.

Result: Constructed a benchmark with 3,020 SafetyPair images across 9 safety categories. The framework reveals weaknesses in vision-language models' ability to distinguish subtle safety differences and serves as effective data augmentation for training lightweight guard models.

Conclusion: SafetyPairs provides the first systematic resource for studying fine-grained image safety distinctions, enabling better evaluation of model safety capabilities and more efficient training of safety guard models.

Abstract: What exactly makes a particular image unsafe? Systematically differentiating
between benign and problematic images is a challenging problem, as subtle
changes to an image, such as an insulting gesture or symbol, can drastically
alter its safety implications. However, existing image safety datasets are
coarse and ambiguous, offering only broad safety labels without isolating the
specific features that drive these differences. We introduce SafetyPairs, a
scalable framework for generating counterfactual pairs of images, that differ
only in the features relevant to the given safety policy, thus flipping their
safety label. By leveraging image editing models, we make targeted changes to
images that alter their safety labels while leaving safety-irrelevant details
unchanged. Using SafetyPairs, we construct a new safety benchmark, which serves
as a powerful source of evaluation data that highlights weaknesses in
vision-language models' abilities to distinguish between subtly different
images. Beyond evaluation, we find our pipeline serves as an effective data
augmentation strategy that improves the sample efficiency of training
lightweight guard models. We release a benchmark containing over 3,020
SafetyPair images spanning a diverse taxonomy of 9 safety categories, providing
the first systematic resource for studying fine-grained image safety
distinctions.

*Longtian Qiu,Shan Ning,Jiaxuan Sun,Xuming He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NoisyGRPO is a multimodal RL framework that improves Chain-of-Thought reasoning in MLLMs by injecting controllable noise into visual inputs and using Bayesian advantage estimation to enhance generalization beyond training distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL frameworks for improving general CoT reasoning in MLLMs struggle with generalization beyond training distribution, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposes NoisyGRPO with two key components: (1) Noise-Injected Exploration Policy that perturbs visual inputs with Gaussian noise to encourage wider exploration, and (2) Bayesian Advantage Estimation that formulates advantage estimation as Bayesian inference using noise level as prior and trajectory reward as likelihood.

Result: Experiments show NoisyGRPO substantially improves generalization and robustness on CoT quality, general capability, and hallucination benchmarks, especially with small-scale MLLMs like Qwen2.5-VL 3B.

Conclusion: NoisyGRPO effectively enhances RL training for MLLMs by combining noise-injected exploration with principled Bayesian advantage estimation, leading to better generalization and robustness in CoT reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in enhancing the general
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). However, when applied to improve general CoT reasoning,
existing RL frameworks often struggle to generalize beyond the training
distribution. To address this, we propose NoisyGRPO, a systematic multimodal RL
framework that introduces controllable noise into visual inputs for enhanced
exploration and explicitly models the advantage estimation process via a
Bayesian framework. Specifically, NoisyGRPO improves RL training by: (1)
\textbf{Noise-Injected Exploration Policy}: Perturbing visual inputs with
Gaussian noise to encourage exploration across a wider range of visual
scenarios; and (2) \textbf{Bayesian Advantage Estimation}: Formulating
advantage estimation as a principled Bayesian inference problem, where the
injected noise level serves as a prior and the observed trajectory reward as
the likelihood. This Bayesian modeling fuses both sources of information to
compute a robust posterior estimate of trajectory advantage, effectively
guiding MLLMs to prefer visually grounded trajectories over noisy ones.
Experiments on standard CoT quality, general capability, and hallucination
benchmarks demonstrate that NoisyGRPO substantially improves generalization and
robustness, especially in RL settings with small-scale MLLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL
3B. The project page is available at

*Ying Ming,Yue Lin,Longfei Zhao,Gengwan Li,Zuopeng Tan,Bing Li,Sheng Xie,Wei Song,Qiqi Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method to generate Digital Contrast CTPA from Non-Contrast CT scans using CycleGAN, reducing risks of contrast agents while maintaining diagnostic quality for pulmonary vascular diseases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CTPA requires iodinated contrast agents that pose nephrotoxicity and allergic reaction risks, especially in high-risk patients. Need safer alternative for pulmonary vascular disease diagnosis.

Method: Cascaded synthesizer based on Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN) trained on 410 paired CTPA and NCCT scans from three centers, with 249 for training/validation and 161 for testing.

Result: Achieved best comprehensive performance with MAE: 165.12, PSNR: 20.27, SSIM: 0.98 on test set. Improved pulmonary vessel segmentation (Dice: 0.70, clDice: 0.71-0.72) and vascular quantification (ICC: 0.81 vs 0.70 for NCCT).

Conclusion: DCCTPA effectively enhances vascular structures without contrast agents, providing valid vessel enhancement and superior image fidelity, especially beneficial for small vessel visualization.

Abstract: Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) is the reference standard
for diagnosing pulmonary vascular diseases such as Pulmonary Embolism (PE) and
Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH). However, its reliance on
iodinated contrast agents poses risks including nephrotoxicity and allergic
reactions, particularly in high-risk patients. This study proposes a method to
generate Digital Contrast CTPA (DCCTPA) from Non-Contrast CT (NCCT) scans using
a cascaded synthesizer based on Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial
Networks (CycleGAN). Totally retrospective 410 paired CTPA and NCCT scans were
obtained from three centers. The model was trained and validated internally on
249 paired images. Extra dataset that comprising 161 paired images was as test
set for model generalization evaluation and downstream clinical tasks
validation. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, the proposed method
achieved the best comprehensive performance by evaluating quantitative metrics
(For validation, MAE: 156.28, PSNR: 20.71 and SSIM: 0.98; For test, MAE:
165.12, PSNR: 20.27 and SSIM: 0.98) and qualitative visualization,
demonstrating valid vessel enhancement, superior image fidelity and structural
preservation. The approach was further applied to downstream tasks of pulmonary
vessel segmentation and vascular quantification. On the test set, the average
Dice, clDice, and clRecall of artery and vein pulmonary segmentation was 0.70,
0.71, 0.73 and 0.70, 0.72, 0.75 respectively, all markedly improved compared
with NCCT inputs.\@ Inter-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for vessel volume
between DCCTPA and CTPA was significantly better than that between NCCT and
CTPA (Average ICC : 0.81 vs 0.70), indicating effective vascular enhancement in
DCCTPA, especially for small vessels.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SIG is a grid-based schema that explicitly encodes spatial relationships and scene structure to improve visual-spatial intelligence in foundation models, outperforming text-only approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods proxy visual-spatial intelligence with textual prompts and VQA scoring, which obscures geometry, invites linguistic shortcuts, and weakens attribution to genuine spatial skills.

Method: Introduces Spatial Intelligence Grid (SIG) - a structured grid-based schema that encodes object layouts, inter-object relations, and physically grounded priors as a complementary channel to text.

Result: SIG yields consistently larger, more stable, and more comprehensive gains across all VSI metrics compared to VQA-only representations in few-shot learning with state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs.

Conclusion: SIG shows promise as a data-labeling and training schema for learning visual-spatial intelligence, and SIGBench provides a benchmark for evaluating both machine and human-like VSI tasks in autonomous driving.

Abstract: How to integrate and verify spatial intelligence in foundation models remains
an open challenge. Current practice often proxies Visual-Spatial Intelligence
(VSI) with purely textual prompts and VQA-style scoring, which obscures
geometry, invites linguistic shortcuts, and weakens attribution to genuinely
spatial skills. We introduce Spatial Intelligence Grid (SIG): a structured,
grid-based schema that explicitly encodes object layouts, inter-object
relations, and physically grounded priors. As a complementary channel to text,
SIG provides a faithful, compositional representation of scene structure for
foundation-model reasoning. Building on SIG, we derive SIG-informed evaluation
metrics that quantify a model's intrinsic VSI, which separates spatial
capability from language priors. In few-shot in-context learning with
state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs (e.g. GPT- and Gemini-family models), SIG
yields consistently larger, more stable, and more comprehensive gains across
all VSI metrics compared to VQA-only representations, indicating its promise as
a data-labeling and training schema for learning VSI. We also release SIGBench,
a benchmark of 1.4K driving frames annotated with ground-truth SIG labels and
human gaze traces, supporting both grid-based machine VSI tasks and
attention-driven, human-like VSI tasks in autonomous-driving scenarios.

*Dogyun Park,Taehoon Lee,Minseok Joo,Hyunwoo J. Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Blockwise Flow Matching (BFM) partitions the generative trajectory into temporal segments with specialized velocity blocks, improving efficiency and sample quality over standard Flow Matching methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Flow Matching uses a single large network for the entire generative trajectory, which struggles to capture distinct signal characteristics across timesteps and incurs high inference costs due to iterative evaluation.

Method: BFM divides the generative process into temporal segments with specialized velocity blocks, adds Semantic Feature Guidance to condition on pretrained representations, and uses Feature Residual Approximation to reduce inference cost while preserving quality.

Result: On ImageNet 256x256, BFM achieves 2.1x to 4.9x acceleration in inference complexity while maintaining comparable generation performance, establishing an improved Pareto frontier over existing Flow Matching methods.

Conclusion: BFM provides a more efficient and effective alternative to standard Flow Matching by using specialized blocks for different temporal segments and incorporating semantic guidance, significantly reducing inference costs while improving sample quality.

Abstract: Recently, Flow Matching models have pushed the boundaries of high-fidelity
data generation across a wide range of domains. It typically employs a single
large network to learn the entire generative trajectory from noise to data.
Despite their effectiveness, this design struggles to capture distinct signal
characteristics across timesteps simultaneously and incurs substantial
inference costs due to the iterative evaluation of the entire model. To address
these limitations, we propose Blockwise Flow Matching (BFM), a novel framework
that partitions the generative trajectory into multiple temporal segments, each
modeled by smaller but specialized velocity blocks. This blockwise design
enables each block to specialize effectively in its designated interval,
improving inference efficiency and sample quality. To further enhance
generation fidelity, we introduce a Semantic Feature Guidance module that
explicitly conditions velocity blocks on semantically rich features aligned
with pretrained representations. Additionally, we propose a lightweight Feature
Residual Approximation strategy that preserves semantic quality while
significantly reducing inference cost. Extensive experiments on ImageNet
256x256 demonstrate that BFM establishes a substantially improved Pareto
frontier over existing Flow Matching methods, achieving 2.1x to 4.9x
accelerations in inference complexity at comparable generation performance.

*Qihang Zhou,Binbin Gao,Guansong Pang,Xin Wang,Jiming Chen,Shibo He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TokenCLIP is a token-wise adaptation framework that enables dynamic alignment between visual and learnable textual spaces for fine-grained anomaly detection, outperforming existing methods that use single textual space alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based anomaly detection methods use a single textual space to align with visual semantics across diverse objects and domains, which hinders accurate capture of varied anomaly semantics due to indiscriminate alignment.

Method: TokenCLIP expands the token-agnostic textual space into orthogonal subspaces and dynamically assigns each visual token to a subspace combination based on semantic affinity through optimal transport, with top-k masking to sparsify the plan and specialize subspaces.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of TokenCLIP over existing methods for anomaly detection on unseen objects in a zero-shot manner.

Conclusion: The proposed token-wise adaptation framework with dynamic alignment between visual and learnable textual spaces enables fine-grained anomaly learning and achieves superior performance compared to single textual space alignment methods.

Abstract: Adapting CLIP for anomaly detection on unseen objects has shown strong
potential in a zero-shot manner. However, existing methods typically rely on a
single textual space to align with visual semantics across diverse objects and
domains. The indiscriminate alignment hinders the model from accurately
capturing varied anomaly semantics. We propose TokenCLIP, a token-wise
adaptation framework that enables dynamic alignment between visual and
learnable textual spaces for fine-grained anomaly learning. Rather than mapping
all visual tokens to a single, token-agnostic textual space, TokenCLIP aligns
each token with a customized textual subspace that represents its visual
characteristics. Explicitly assigning a unique learnable textual space to each
token is computationally intractable and prone to insufficient optimization. We
instead expand the token-agnostic textual space into a set of orthogonal
subspaces, and then dynamically assign each token to a subspace combination
guided by semantic affinity, which jointly supports customized and efficient
token-wise adaptation. To this end, we formulate dynamic alignment as an
optimal transport problem, where all visual tokens in an image are transported
to textual subspaces based on semantic similarity. The transport constraints of
OT ensure sufficient optimization across subspaces and encourage them to focus
on different semantics. Solving the problem yields a transport plan that
adaptively assigns each token to semantically relevant subspaces. A top-k
masking is then applied to sparsify the plan and specialize subspaces for
distinct visual regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
TokenCLIP.

TL;DR: KBE is a dynamic multimodal evaluation framework that transforms static VQA benchmarks into evolving versions using graph formulation and knowledge integration to address data contamination and saturation issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing static benchmarks for multimodal large language models suffer from data contamination and saturation, leading to unreliable performance evaluations.

Method: Apply graph formulation to represent VQA samples, then expand static benchmarks by integrating multimodal knowledge through question reconstruction (re-selecting visual information) and expansion with external textual knowledge.

Result: KBE enables difficulty-controllable evaluation and provides more comprehensive assessment of MLLM capabilities while alleviating data contamination and saturation risks.

Conclusion: KBE offers a dynamic, evolving evaluation framework that addresses limitations of static benchmarks and provides more reliable assessment of multimodal large language models.

Abstract: The rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) calls for more
reliable evaluation protocols. Existing static benchmarks suffer from the
potential risk of data contamination and saturation, leading to inflated or
misleading performance evaluations. To address these issues, we first apply
Graph formulation to represent a static or dynamic VQA sample. With the
formulation, we propose Knowledge-enhanced Benchmark Evolution(KBE), a dynamic
multimodal evaluation framework. KBE first analyzes the original static
benchmark, then expands it by integrating multimodal knowledge, transforming
the static benchmark into a controllable, dynamic evolving version. Crucially,
KBE can both reconstruct questions by Re-selecting visual information in the
original image and expand existing questions with external textual knowledge.
It enables difficulty-controllable evaluation by adjusting the degree of
question exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KBE alleviates the
risk of data contamination, data saturation, and provides a more comprehensive
assessment of MLLM capabilities.

*Anh Nguyen,Viet Nguyen,Duc Vu,Trung Dao,Chi Tran,Toan Tran,Anh Tran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces iSM, a unified training framework that addresses five core limitations of shortcut models in generative modeling, enabling improved performance across one-step, few-step, and multi-step sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shortcut models offer a promising non-adversarial paradigm for generative modeling but face critical performance bottlenecks including compounding guidance artifacts, inflexible fixed guidance, frequency bias, divergent self-consistency, and curvy flow trajectories that hinder widespread adoption.

Method: The iSM framework includes four key improvements: Intrinsic Guidance for dynamic control over guidance strength, Multi-Level Wavelet Loss to mitigate frequency bias, Scaling Optimal Transport (sOT) to reduce training variance and learn straighter paths, and Twin EMA strategy to reconcile training stability with self-consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments on ImageNet 256x256 demonstrate substantial FID improvements over baseline shortcut models across all sampling modes (one-step, few-step, multi-step), making shortcut models a viable and competitive class of generative models.

Conclusion: The proposed iSM framework systematically resolves the five core limitations of shortcut models, establishing them as a competitive alternative in generative modeling with improved performance and flexibility across different sampling regimes.

Abstract: Shortcut models represent a promising, non-adversarial paradigm for
generative modeling, uniquely supporting one-step, few-step, and multi-step
sampling from a single trained network. However, their widespread adoption has
been stymied by critical performance bottlenecks. This paper tackles the five
core issues that held shortcut models back: (1) the hidden flaw of compounding
guidance, which we are the first to formalize, causing severe image artifacts;
(2) inflexible fixed guidance that restricts inference-time control; (3) a
pervasive frequency bias driven by a reliance on low-level distances in the
direct domain, which biases reconstructions toward low frequencies; (4)
divergent self-consistency arising from a conflict with EMA training; and (5)
curvy flow trajectories that impede convergence. To address these challenges,
we introduce iSM, a unified training framework that systematically resolves
each limitation. Our framework is built on four key improvements: Intrinsic
Guidance provides explicit, dynamic control over guidance strength, resolving
both compounding guidance and inflexibility. A Multi-Level Wavelet Loss
mitigates frequency bias to restore high-frequency details. Scaling Optimal
Transport (sOT) reduces training variance and learns straighter, more stable
generative paths. Finally, a Twin EMA strategy reconciles training stability
with self-consistency. Extensive experiments on ImageNet 256 x 256 demonstrate
that our approach yields substantial FID improvements over baseline shortcut
models across one-step, few-step, and multi-step generation, making shortcut
models a viable and competitive class of generative models.

### [28] [Topology Sculptor, Shape Refiner: Discrete Diffusion Model for High-Fidelity 3D Meshes Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21264)
*Kaiyu Song,Hanjiang Lai,Yaqing Zhang,Chuangjian Cai,Yan Pan Kun Yue,Jian Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TSSR is a novel method for generating high-quality 3D artist-style meshes using Discrete Diffusion Models, enabling parallel generation through decoupled training, improved architecture with RoPE, and connection loss for topological constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve highly accurate token prediction while enabling parallel generation, overcoming limitations of sequential autoregressive methods by allowing concurrent visibility of all mesh tokens for improved efficiency and control.

Method: Uses three key innovations: 1) Decoupled Training and Hybrid Inference separating topology sculpting and shape refinement stages, 2) Improved Hourglass Architecture with bidirectional attention and face-vertex-sequence level Rotational Positional Embeddings (RoPE), 3) Novel Connection Loss as topological constraint.

Result: Generates high-quality 3D artist-style meshes capable of achieving up to 10,000 faces at remarkable spatial resolution of 1024^3, as demonstrated through extensive experiments on complex datasets.

Conclusion: TSSR successfully leverages parallel generation through discrete diffusion models to produce realistic and high-fidelity 3D meshes with superior efficiency compared to sequential methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Topology Sculptor, Shape Refiner (TSSR), a novel
method for generating high-quality, artist-style 3D meshes based on Discrete
Diffusion Models (DDMs). Our primary motivation for TSSR is to achieve highly
accurate token prediction while enabling parallel generation, a significant
advantage over sequential autoregressive methods. By allowing TSSR to "see" all
mesh tokens concurrently, we unlock a new level of efficiency and control. We
leverage this parallel generation capability through three key innovations: 1)
Decoupled Training and Hybrid Inference, which distinctly separates the
DDM-based generation into a topology sculpting stage and a subsequent shape
refinement stage. This strategic decoupling enables TSSR to effectively capture
both intricate local topology and overarching global shape. 2) An Improved
Hourglass Architecture, featuring bidirectional attention enriched by
face-vertex-sequence level Rotational Positional Embeddings (RoPE), thereby
capturing richer contextual information across the mesh structure. 3) A novel
Connection Loss, which acts as a topological constraint to further enhance the
realism and fidelity of the generated meshes. Extensive experiments on complex
datasets demonstrate that TSSR generates high-quality 3D artist-style meshes,
capable of achieving up to 10,000 faces at a remarkable spatial resolution of
$1024^3$. The code will be released at:

TL;DR: SAGE-3D upgrades 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with object-level semantics and physics for Visual-Language Navigation, creating executable environments with improved generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS has photorealistic rendering but lacks fine-grained semantics and physical executability needed for Visual-Language Navigation tasks.

Method: Two components: (1) Object-Centric Semantic Grounding adds object-level annotations to 3DGS; (2) Physics-Aware Execution Jointing embeds collision objects and constructs physical interfaces.

Result: Created InteriorGS dataset with 1K annotated 3DGS scenes and SAGE-Bench benchmark with 2M VLN data. 3DGS data is harder to converge but shows strong generalization, improving baseline performance by 31% on VLN-CE Unseen task.

Conclusion: SAGE-3D successfully bridges the gap between 3DGS representation and practical VLN applications by adding semantic and physical capabilities, demonstrating improved generalization performance.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a 3D representation method with photorealistic
real-time rendering capabilities, is regarded as an effective tool for
narrowing the sim-to-real gap. However, it lacks fine-grained semantics and
physical executability for Visual-Language Navigation (VLN). To address this,
we propose SAGE-3D (Semantically and Physically Aligned Gaussian Environments
for 3D Navigation), a new paradigm that upgrades 3DGS into an executable,
semantically and physically aligned environment. It comprises two components:
(1) Object-Centric Semantic Grounding, which adds object-level fine-grained
annotations to 3DGS; and (2) Physics-Aware Execution Jointing, which embeds
collision objects into 3DGS and constructs rich physical interfaces. We release
InteriorGS, containing 1K object-annotated 3DGS indoor scene data, and
introduce SAGE-Bench, the first 3DGS-based VLN benchmark with 2M VLN data.
Experiments show that 3DGS scene data is more difficult to converge, while
exhibiting strong generalizability, improving baseline performance by 31% on
the VLN-CE Unseen task. The data and code will be available soon.

*Lu Zhang,Jiazuo Yu,Haomiao Xiong,Ping Hu,Yunzhi Zhuge,Huchuan Lu,You He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FineRS is a two-stage reinforcement learning framework that enables MLLMs to accurately segment and reason about extremely small objects in high-resolution images through global semantic exploration and localized perceptual refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with precise understanding and localization of visual details in high-resolution images, especially for extra-small objects in cluttered contexts, due to restricted input resolutions.

Method: Two-stage coarse-to-fine pipeline: Global Semantic Exploration (GSE) for instruction-guided reasoning and coarse target region generation, and Localized Perceptual Refinement (LPR) for accurate bounding box and segmentation mask refinement. Uses locate-informed retrospective reward to couple stages.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art MLLM-based approaches on both instruction-guided segmentation and visual reasoning tasks on FineRS-4k and public datasets.

Conclusion: FineRS effectively addresses the challenge of small object understanding in high-resolution images through its two-stage reinforcement learning framework and novel dataset.

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities
across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, due to the restricted
input resolutions, MLLMs face significant challenges in precisely understanding
and localizing visual details in high-resolution images -- particularly when
dealing with extra-small objects embedded in cluttered contexts. To address
this issue, we propose \textsc{FineRS}, a two-stage MLLM-based reinforcement
learning framework for jointly reasoning and segmenting extremely small objects
within high-resolution scenes. \textsc{FineRS} adopts a coarse-to-fine pipeline
comprising Global Semantic Exploration (GSE) and Localized Perceptual
Refinement (LPR). Specifically, GSE performs instruction-guided reasoning to
generate a textural response and a coarse target region, while LPR refines this
region to produce an accurate bounding box and segmentation mask. To couple the
two stages, we introduce a locate-informed retrospective reward, where LPR's
outputs are used to optimize GSE for more robust coarse region exploration. %
Additionally, we present \textsc{FineRS}-4k, a new dataset for evaluating MLLMs
on attribute-level reasoning and pixel-level segmentation on subtle,
small-scale targets in complex high-resolution scenes. Experimental results on
\textsc{FineRS}-4k and public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art MLLM-based approaches on both instruction-guided
segmentation and visual reasoning tasks.

### [31] [VL-SAE: Interpreting and Enhancing Vision-Language Alignment with a Unified Concept Set](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21323)
*Shufan Shen,Junshu Sun,Qingming Huang,Shuhui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VL-SAE is a sparse autoencoder that interprets vision-language representations by mapping them to a unified concept set through neuron activations, enabling both interpretation and enhancement of vision-language alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of interpretability in vision-language alignment components, as it's difficult to map multi-modal representations into a unified concept set.

Method: Propose VL-SAE with distance-based encoder and modality-specific decoders, using cosine similarity for semantic alignment and encouraging consistent neuron activations for semantically similar representations during self-supervised training.

Result: VL-SAE successfully interprets vision-language alignment by comparing semantics with concepts and enhances alignment at concept level, improving performance in zero-shot image classification and hallucination elimination across multiple VLMs like CLIP and LLaVA.

Conclusion: VL-SAE provides an effective framework for both interpreting and enhancing vision-language alignment through concept-level representation mapping, demonstrating practical benefits in downstream tasks.

Abstract: The alignment of vision-language representations endows current
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong multi-modal reasoning capabilities.
However, the interpretability of the alignment component remains uninvestigated
due to the difficulty in mapping the semantics of multi-modal representations
into a unified concept set. To address this problem, we propose VL-SAE, a
sparse autoencoder that encodes vision-language representations into its hidden
activations. Each neuron in its hidden layer correlates to a concept
represented by semantically similar images and texts, thereby interpreting
these representations with a unified concept set. To establish the
neuron-concept correlation, we encourage semantically similar representations
to exhibit consistent neuron activations during self-supervised training.
First, to measure the semantic similarity of multi-modal representations, we
perform their alignment in an explicit form based on cosine similarity. Second,
we construct the VL-SAE with a distance-based encoder and two modality-specific
decoders to ensure the activation consistency of semantically similar
representations. Experiments across multiple VLMs (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA)
demonstrate the superior capability of VL-SAE in interpreting and enhancing the
vision-language alignment. For interpretation, the alignment between vision and
language representations can be understood by comparing their semantics with
concepts. For enhancement, the alignment can be strengthened by aligning
vision-language representations at the concept level, contributing to
performance improvements in downstream tasks, including zero-shot image
classification and hallucination elimination. Codes are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FORM is a machine learning framework that predicts 3D cellular structure changes under perturbations using a morphology encoder and diffusion-based trajectory module, trained on 65,000+ 3D cell volumes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current computational models are limited to 2D representations, which cannot capture the full complexity of 3D cell morphology under perturbation, creating a bottleneck for accurate virtual cell models.

Method: FORM consists of two components: a morphology encoder trained via multi-channel VQGAN to learn 3D shape representations, and a diffusion-based perturbation trajectory module that models morphology evolution across conditions.

Result: FORM enables unconditional morphology synthesis, conditional simulation of perturbed states, prediction of downstream signaling, combinatorial perturbation effects, and morphodynamic transitions between unseen perturbations.

Conclusion: FORM and the accompanying MorphoEval benchmark suite advance toward realizing the 3D virtual cell by linking morphology, perturbation, and function through high-resolution predictive simulation.

Abstract: Understanding how cells respond to external stimuli is a central challenge in
biomedical research and drug development. Current computational frameworks for
modelling cellular responses remain restricted to two-dimensional
representations, limiting their capacity to capture the complexity of cell
morphology under perturbation. This dimensional constraint poses a critical
bottleneck for the development of accurate virtual cell models. Here, we
present FORM, a machine learning framework for predicting perturbation-induced
changes in three-dimensional cellular structure. FORM consists of two
components: a morphology encoder, trained end-to-end via a novel multi-channel
VQGAN to learn compact 3D representations of cell shape, and a diffusion-based
perturbation trajectory module that captures how morphology evolves across
perturbation conditions. Trained on a large-scale dataset of over 65,000
multi-fluorescence 3D cell volumes spanning diverse chemical and genetic
perturbations, FORM supports both unconditional morphology synthesis and
conditional simulation of perturbed cell states. Beyond generation, FORM can
predict downstream signalling activity, simulate combinatorial perturbation
effects, and model morphodynamic transitions between states of unseen
perturbations. To evaluate performance, we introduce MorphoEval, a benchmarking
suite that quantifies perturbation-induced morphological changes in structural,
statistical, and biological dimensions. Together, FORM and MorphoEval work
toward the realisation of the 3D virtual cell by linking morphology,
perturbation, and function through high-resolution predictive simulation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CT-CLIP framework combines CNN, Transformer, and CLIP for apple leaf disease recognition, achieving high accuracy by fusing local and global features and using multimodal learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-scale feature fusion methods fail to adequately handle the phenotypic heterogeneity of apple leaf diseases and the relationships between local and global features in complex orchard environments.

Method: Proposes CNN-Transformer-CLIP (CT-CLIP) framework: CNN extracts local lesion details, Vision Transformer captures global structural relationships, Adaptive Feature Fusion Module dynamically fuses features, and multimodal image-text learning leverages CLIP weights for alignment.

Result: Achieves 97.38% accuracy on public dataset and 96.12% on self-built dataset, outperforming baseline methods and showing strong capabilities in complex environmental conditions.

Conclusion: CT-CLIP provides an innovative and practical solution for automated agricultural disease recognition, significantly enhancing identification accuracy under complex conditions.

Abstract: In complex orchard environments, the phenotypic heterogeneity of different
apple leaf diseases, characterized by significant variation among lesions,
poses a challenge to traditional multi-scale feature fusion methods. These
methods only integrate multi-layer features extracted by convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and fail to adequately account for the relationships between
local and global features. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-branch
recognition framework named CNN-Transformer-CLIP (CT-CLIP). The framework
synergistically employs a CNN to extract local lesion detail features and a
Vision Transformer to capture global structural relationships. An Adaptive
Feature Fusion Module (AFFM) then dynamically fuses these features, achieving
optimal coupling of local and global information and effectively addressing the
diversity in lesion morphology and distribution. Additionally, to mitigate
interference from complex backgrounds and significantly enhance recognition
accuracy under few-shot conditions, this study proposes a multimodal image-text
learning approach. By leveraging pre-trained CLIP weights, it achieves deep
alignment between visual features and disease semantic descriptions.
Experimental results show that CT-CLIP achieves accuracies of 97.38% and 96.12%
on a publicly available apple disease and a self-built dataset, outperforming
several baseline methods. The proposed CT-CLIP demonstrates strong capabilities
in recognizing agricultural diseases, significantly enhances identification
accuracy under complex environmental conditions, provides an innovative and
practical solution for automated disease recognition in agricultural
applications.

*Xinyu Zhou,Tongxin Pan,Lingyi Hong,Pinxue Guo,Haijing Guo,Zhaoyu Chen,Kaixun Jiang,Wenqiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a dynamic semantic aware correlation modeling framework for UAV tracking that enhances semantic relevance between template and search regions to improve accuracy under challenging conditions like camera motion and fast motion, while providing speed-accuracy trade-offs through model pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UAV tracking methods focus on speed but lack semantic awareness, leading to poor performance under challenging conditions like camera motion, fast motion, and low resolution. The inability to extract accurate localization information from templates hinders tracking robustness.

Method: Uses a Dynamic Semantic Relevance Generator combined with Transformer correlation maps to explore semantic relevance between template and search regions. Includes a pruning method to create multiple model variants for speed-accuracy trade-offs.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on multiple UAV tracking datasets, demonstrating improved accuracy and robustness under challenging conditions while enabling flexible deployment through speed-accuracy trade-offs.

Conclusion: The proposed dynamic semantic aware correlation modeling framework effectively addresses limitations of existing UAV tracking methods by enhancing semantic relevance extraction, leading to improved performance under challenging conditions with flexible speed-accuracy options.

Abstract: UAV tracking can be widely applied in scenarios such as disaster rescue,
environmental monitoring, and logistics transportation. However, existing UAV
tracking methods predominantly emphasize speed and lack exploration in semantic
awareness, which hinders the search region from extracting accurate
localization information from the template. The limitation results in
suboptimal performance under typical UAV tracking challenges such as camera
motion, fast motion, and low resolution, etc. To address this issue, we propose
a dynamic semantic aware correlation modeling tracking framework. The core of
our framework is a Dynamic Semantic Relevance Generator, which, in combination
with the correlation map from the Transformer, explore semantic relevance. The
approach enhances the search region's ability to extract important information
from the template, improving accuracy and robustness under the aforementioned
challenges. Additionally, to enhance the tracking speed, we design a pruning
method for the proposed framework. Therefore, we present multiple model
variants that achieve trade-offs between speed and accuracy, enabling flexible
deployment according to the available computational resources. Experimental
results validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving competitive
performance on multiple UAV tracking datasets. The code is available at

*Anupam Pani,Yanchao Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A gaze-regularized framework that enhances Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for egocentric understanding tasks using gaze only during training, improving prediction accuracy without requiring gaze at inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Eye gaze provides valuable cues about attention and future actions, making it powerful for modeling egocentric behavior, but prior approaches either ignore gaze or use it as direct input rather than leveraging it for training regularization.

Method: Introduces gaze-regularized attention mechanism that aligns model focus with human visual gaze during training. The method is flexible and modular, working across multiple VLM architectures that use attention mechanisms.

Result: Improves semantic prediction scores by up to 11% for future event prediction and around 7% for current activity understanding compared to baseline models trained without gaze regularization.

Conclusion: Establishes foundation for using human gaze to enhance VLM predictive capabilities in real-world scenarios like assistive robots and human-machine collaboration, demonstrating the value of gaze-guided training for accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Eye gaze offers valuable cues about attention, short-term intent, and future
actions, making it a powerful signal for modeling egocentric behavior. In this
work, we propose a gaze-regularized framework that enhances VLMs for two key
egocentric understanding tasks: fine-grained future event prediction and
current activity understanding. Unlike prior approaches that rely solely on
visual inputs or use gaze as an auxiliary input signal , our method uses gaze
only during training. We introduce a gaze-regularized attention mechanism that
aligns model focus with human visual gaze. This design is flexible and modular,
allowing it to generalize across multiple VLM architectures that utilize
attention. Experimental results show that our approach improves semantic
prediction scores by up to 11 for future event prediction and around 7 for
current activity understanding, compared to the corresponding baseline models
trained without gaze regularization. These results highlight the value of
gaze-guided training in improving the accuracy and robustness of egocentric
VLMs. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for using human gaze to
enhance the predictive capabilities of VLMs in real-world scenarios like
assistive robots and human-machine collaboration. Code and additional

*Valentin Boussot,Cédric Hémon,Jean-Claude Nunes,Jean-Louis Dillenseger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified pipeline for synthetic CT generation from MRI and CBCT using a 2.5D U-Net++ with ResNet-34 encoder, trained with combined L1 and IMPACT-Synth perceptual loss. IMPACT registration outperformed mutual information for anatomical consistency, though Elastix-aligned data scored higher on validation due to registration bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop robust synthetic CT generation that mitigates registration bias and improves anatomical fidelity, addressing how registration errors propagate into supervised learning and evaluation.

Method: 2.5D U-Net++ with ResNet-34 encoder trained jointly across anatomical regions, using combined L1 and IMPACT-Synth perceptual loss derived from SAM and TotalSegmentator. Training with AdamW on patch-based inputs with test-time augmentation and five-fold ensembling. Evaluated two registration strategies: Elastix with mutual information vs IMPACT feature-based similarity.

Result: IMPACT registration achieved more accurate anatomical alignments and lower MAE on local tests, but Elastix-aligned models scored higher on public validation due to registration bias favoring evaluation pipeline consistency.

Conclusion: Registration errors significantly impact supervised learning and evaluation metrics. IMPACT registration promotes anatomical consistency and helps develop more robust, generalizable sCT synthesis models by mitigating registration bias.

Abstract: We participated in the SynthRAD2025 challenge (Tasks 1 and 2) with a unified
pipeline for synthetic CT (sCT) generation from MRI and CBCT, implemented using
the KonfAI framework. Our model is a 2.5D U-Net++ with a ResNet-34 encoder,
trained jointly across anatomical regions and fine-tuned per region. The loss
function combined pixel-wise L1 loss with IMPACT-Synth, a perceptual loss
derived from SAM and TotalSegmentator to enhance structural fidelity. Training
was performed using AdamW (initial learning rate = 0.001, halved every 25k
steps) on patch-based, normalized, body-masked inputs (320x320 for MRI, 256x256
for CBCT), with random flipping as the only augmentation. No post-processing
was applied. Final predictions leveraged test-time augmentation and five-fold
ensembling. The best model was selected based on validation MAE. Two
registration strategies were evaluated: (i) Elastix with mutual information,
consistent with the challenge pipeline, and (ii) IMPACT, a feature-based
similarity metric leveraging pretrained segmentation networks. On the local
test sets, IMPACT-based registration achieved more accurate and anatomically
consistent alignments than mutual-information-based registration, resulting in
improved sCT synthesis with lower MAE and more realistic anatomical structures.
On the public validation set, however, models trained with Elastix-aligned data
achieved higher scores, reflecting a registration bias favoring alignment
strategies consistent with the evaluation pipeline. This highlights how
registration errors can propagate into supervised learning, influencing both
training and evaluation, and potentially inflating performance metrics at the
expense of anatomical fidelity. By promoting anatomically consistent alignment,
IMPACT helps mitigate this bias and supports the development of more robust and
generalizable sCT synthesis models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework that enables diffusion models to adapt image generation quality based on real-time network bandwidth constraints, allowing early-stop sampling while maintaining appropriate perceptual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional diffusion models use fixed denoising steps regardless of transmission limitations, leading to wasted computation and quality loss when heavy compression is required in bandwidth-constrained cloud-to-device scenarios.

Method: Joint end-to-end training strategy where diffusion model is conditioned on target quality level derived from available bandwidth, using lightweight quality embedding to guide denoising trajectory with minimal architectural changes.

Result: Significantly improves visual fidelity of bandwidth-adapted generations compared to naive early-stopping, maintaining perceptual quality appropriate to transmission conditions.

Conclusion: Offers a promising solution for efficient image delivery in bandwidth-constrained environments by enabling adaptive quality generation based on real-time network conditions.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enable diffusion models to
adapt their generation quality based on real-time network bandwidth
constraints. Traditional diffusion models produce high-fidelity images by
performing a fixed number of denoising steps, regardless of downstream
transmission limitations. However, in practical cloud-to-device scenarios,
limited bandwidth often necessitates heavy compression, leading to loss of fine
textures and wasted computation. To address this, we introduce a joint
end-to-end training strategy where the diffusion model is conditioned on a
target quality level derived from the available bandwidth. During training, the
model learns to adaptively modulate the denoising process, enabling early-stop
sampling that maintains perceptual quality appropriate to the target
transmission condition. Our method requires minimal architectural changes and
leverages a lightweight quality embedding to guide the denoising trajectory.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the
visual fidelity of bandwidth-adapted generations compared to naive
early-stopping, offering a promising solution for efficient image delivery in
bandwidth-constrained environments. Code is available at:

TL;DR: TerraGen is a unified layout-to-image generation framework for remote sensing that enables spatially controllable synthesis across multiple vision tasks, addressing limitations of task-isolated generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative data augmentation frameworks are task-isolated (each vision task requires independent generative model) and ignore geographical information and spatial constraints in remote sensing.

Method: Introduces geographic-spatial layout encoder unifying bounding box and segmentation mask inputs, multi-scale injection scheme, and mask-weighted loss to encode spatial constraints from global to fine details.

Result: Achieves best generation image quality across diverse tasks, enhances downstream task performance as universal data-augmentation generator, and demonstrates robust cross-task generalization in full-data and few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: TerraGen provides a unified solution for flexible, spatially controllable remote sensing image generation that significantly improves downstream vision task performance and generalizes well across different data scenarios.

Abstract: Remote sensing vision tasks require extensive labeled data across multiple,
interconnected domains. However, current generative data augmentation
frameworks are task-isolated, i.e., each vision task requires training an
independent generative model, and ignores the modeling of geographical
information and spatial constraints. To address these issues, we propose
\textbf{TerraGen}, a unified layout-to-image generation framework that enables
flexible, spatially controllable synthesis of remote sensing imagery for
various high-level vision tasks, e.g., detection, segmentation, and extraction.
Specifically, TerraGen introduces a geographic-spatial layout encoder that
unifies bounding box and segmentation mask inputs, combined with a multi-scale
injection scheme and mask-weighted loss to explicitly encode spatial
constraints, from global structures to fine details. Also, we construct the
first large-scale multi-task remote sensing layout generation dataset
containing 45k images and establish a standardized evaluation protocol for this
task. Experimental results show that our TerraGen can achieve the best
generation image quality across diverse tasks. Additionally, TerraGen can be
used as a universal data-augmentation generator, enhancing downstream task
performance significantly and demonstrating robust cross-task generalisation in
both full-data and few-shot scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A depth-consistency-constrained method for seamless image stitching that addresses parallax issues through multi-stage alignment with depth regularization and graph-based seam optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Significant variations in object depth cause large parallax in image stitching, leading to ghosting and misalignment in stitched results.

Method: Multi-stage mechanism with global depth regularization constraints for alignment, graph-based low-cost computation for optimal seam determination, soft-seam region diffusion for transition areas, and reparameterization strategy for efficiency optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance against existing methods, effectively mitigating alignment errors induced by parallax and achieving natural seamless stitching.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses parallax issues in image stitching through depth-constrained alignment and optimized seam computation, producing high-quality results with improved efficiency.

Abstract: Image stitching synthesizes images captured from multiple perspectives into a
single image with a broader field of view. The significant variations in object
depth often lead to large parallax, resulting in ghosting and misalignment in
the stitched results. To address this, we propose a
depth-consistency-constrained seamless-free image stitching method. First, to
tackle the multi-view alignment difficulties caused by parallax, a multi-stage
mechanism combined with global depth regularization constraints is developed to
enhance the alignment accuracy of the same apparent target across different
depth ranges. Second, during the multi-view image fusion process, an optimal
stitching seam is determined through graph-based low-cost computation, and a
soft-seam region is diffused to precisely locate transition areas, thereby
effectively mitigating alignment errors induced by parallax and achieving
natural and seamless stitching results. Furthermore, considering the
computational overhead in the shift regression process, a reparameterization
strategy is incorporated to optimize the structural design, significantly
improving algorithm efficiency while maintaining optimal performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method against
the existing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/DLUT-YRH/DSFN.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance video retrieval for long-video platforms by addressing the limitations of existing methods in processing untrimmed videos and multi-modal queries, and to better serve practical applications on platforms like Bilibili.

Method: Proposes MUVR benchmark with 53K untrimmed videos, 1,050 multi-modal queries, and 84K matches. Uses multi-level visual correspondence (copy, event, scene, instance, action, others) and three evaluation versions (Base, Filter, QA) with Reranking Score for MLLMs.

Result: Extensive evaluations reveal limitations of current retrieval methods in handling untrimmed videos and multi-modal queries, and MLLMs' weaknesses in multi-video understanding and reranking. The benchmark provides comprehensive assessment capabilities.

Conclusion: MUVR successfully establishes a practical benchmark for untrimmed video retrieval, highlighting current model limitations and providing a foundation for future improvements in multi-modal video understanding and retrieval systems.

Abstract: We propose the Multi-modal Untrimmed Video Retrieval task, along with a new
benchmark (MUVR) to advance video retrieval for long-video platforms. MUVR aims
to retrieve untrimmed videos containing relevant segments using multi-modal
queries. It has the following features: 1) Practical retrieval paradigm: MUVR
supports video-centric multi-modal queries, expressing fine-grained retrieval
needs through long text descriptions, video tag prompts, and mask prompts. It
adopts a one-to-many retrieval paradigm and focuses on untrimmed videos,
tailored for long-video platform applications. 2) Multi-level visual

and precisely define retrieval matching criteria, we construct multi-level
visual correspondence based on core video content (e.g., news events, travel
locations, dance moves) which users are interested in and want to retrieve. It
covers six levels: copy, event, scene, instance, action, and others. 3)
Comprehensive evaluation criteria: We develop 3 versions of MUVR (i.e., Base,

assesses MLLMs in a question-answering format. We also propose a Reranking
Score to evaluate the reranking ability of MLLMs. MUVR consists of 53K
untrimmed videos from the video platform Bilibili, with 1,050 multi-modal
queries and 84K matches. Extensive evaluations of 3 state-of-the-art video
retrieval models, 6 image-based VLMs, and 10 MLLMs are conducted. MUVR reveals
the limitations of retrieval methods in processing untrimmed videos and
multi-modal queries, as well as MLLMs in multi-video understanding and
reranking. Our code and benchmark is available at

*Whie Jung,Semin Kim,Junee Kim,Seunghoon Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A scalable framework for adaptive visual concept learning that identifies image-related concept axes and grounds visual concepts along these axes in real-world scenes without predefined categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches to language-grounded visual concept learning are limited to few predefined axes (like color and shape) and typically work only on synthetic datasets, failing to capture the rich semantic dimensions humans naturally interpret.

Method: Leverages pretrained vision-language model with universal prompting strategy to identify diverse image-related axes without prior knowledge. Uses universal concept encoder to bind visual features to discovered axes without additional parameters, and optimizes compositional anchoring objective for independent axis manipulation.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on ImageNet, CelebA-HQ, and AFHQ datasets, showing superior editing capabilities across diverse real-world concepts and strong compositional generalization compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The framework enables scalable visual concept learning that adaptively discovers and grounds concepts along diverse semantic axes in real-world scenes, outperforming existing visual concept learning and text-based editing approaches.

Abstract: Human intelligence effortlessly interprets visual scenes along a rich
spectrum of semantic dimensions. However, existing approaches to
language-grounded visual concept learning are limited to a few predefined
primitive axes, such as color and shape, and are typically explored in
synthetic datasets. In this work, we propose a scalable framework that
adaptively identifies image-related concept axes and grounds visual concepts
along these axes in real-world scenes. Leveraging a pretrained vision-language
model and our universal prompting strategy, our framework identifies a diverse
image-related axes without any prior knowledge. Our universal concept encoder
adaptively binds visual features to the discovered axes without introducing
additional model parameters for each concept. To ground visual concepts along
the discovered axes, we optimize a compositional anchoring objective, which
ensures that each axis can be independently manipulated without affecting
others. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on subsets of
ImageNet, CelebA-HQ, and AFHQ, showcasing superior editing capabilities across
diverse real-world concepts that are too varied to be manually predefined. Our
method also exhibits strong compositional generalization, outperforming
existing visual concept learning and text-based editing methods. The code is

*Honghua Chen,Yushi Lan,Yongwei Chen,Xingang Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArtiLatent is a generative framework that synthesizes articulated 3D objects with fine geometry, accurate articulation, and realistic appearance by combining sparse voxel representations with articulation properties in a unified latent space using a VAE and latent diffusion model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create articulated 3D objects that maintain geometric consistency and realistic appearance across different articulation states, addressing the challenge of modeling articulation-dependent visibility changes and occluded regions.

Method: Jointly models part geometry and articulation dynamics using sparse voxel embeddings with articulation properties in a unified latent space via VAE, then trains a latent diffusion model for sampling. Uses articulation-aware Gaussian decoder for photorealistic reconstruction that conditions appearance on articulation state.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches on furniture-like objects from PartNet-Mobility and ACD datasets in geometric consistency and appearance fidelity, especially for regions that are typically occluded in static poses.

Conclusion: ArtiLatent provides a scalable solution for articulated 3D object synthesis and manipulation by effectively modeling both geometry and articulation dynamics while maintaining visual realism across different configurations.

Abstract: We propose ArtiLatent, a generative framework that synthesizes human-made 3D
objects with fine-grained geometry, accurate articulation, and realistic
appearance. Our approach jointly models part geometry and articulation dynamics
by embedding sparse voxel representations and associated articulation
properties, including joint type, axis, origin, range, and part category, into
a unified latent space via a variational autoencoder. A latent diffusion model
is then trained over this space to enable diverse yet physically plausible
sampling. To reconstruct photorealistic 3D shapes, we introduce an
articulation-aware Gaussian decoder that accounts for articulation-dependent
visibility changes (e.g., revealing the interior of a drawer when opened). By
conditioning appearance decoding on articulation state, our method assigns
plausible texture features to regions that are typically occluded in static
poses, significantly improving visual realism across articulation
configurations. Extensive experiments on furniture-like objects from
PartNet-Mobility and ACD datasets demonstrate that ArtiLatent outperforms
existing approaches in geometric consistency and appearance fidelity. Our
framework provides a scalable solution for articulated 3D object synthesis and
manipulation.

TL;DR: OpenHype introduces a novel approach using continuous hyperbolic latent space to represent 3D scene hierarchies, addressing limitations of existing methods that require multiple rendering passes or rely on predefined discrete hierarchies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable holistic understanding of 3D environments for autonomous agents by modeling hierarchical structures, which existing implicit representation methods struggle with due to inefficiency and poor generalization.

Method: Uses continuous hyperbolic latent space to encode multi-scale relationships and enable smooth hierarchy traversal through geodesic paths, leveraging hyperbolic geometry properties.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on standard benchmarks, demonstrating superior efficiency and adaptability in 3D scene understanding.

Conclusion: OpenHype provides an effective solution for hierarchical 3D scene representation that overcomes limitations of existing methods while achieving better performance.

Abstract: Modeling the inherent hierarchical structure of 3D objects and 3D scenes is
highly desirable, as it enables a more holistic understanding of environments
for autonomous agents. Accomplishing this with implicit representations, such
as Neural Radiance Fields, remains an unexplored challenge. Existing methods
that explicitly model hierarchical structures often face significant
limitations: they either require multiple rendering passes to capture
embeddings at different levels of granularity, significantly increasing
inference time, or rely on predefined, closed-set discrete hierarchies that
generalize poorly to the diverse and nuanced structures encountered by agents
in the real world. To address these challenges, we propose OpenHype, a novel
approach that represents scene hierarchies using a continuous hyperbolic latent
space. By leveraging the properties of hyperbolic geometry, OpenHype naturally
encodes multi-scale relationships and enables smooth traversal of hierarchies
through geodesic paths in latent space. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on standard benchmarks, demonstrating superior efficiency and
adaptability in 3D scene understanding.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully overcomes data scarcity by leveraging simulator-generated demonstrations to learn efficient world models for deformable object dynamics.

Abstract: Interactive world models that simulate object dynamics are crucial for
robotics, VR, and AR. However, it remains a significant challenge to learn
physics-consistent dynamics models from limited real-world video data,
especially for deformable objects with spatially-varying physical properties.
To overcome the challenge of data scarcity, we propose PhysWorld, a novel
framework that utilizes a simulator to synthesize physically plausible and
diverse demonstrations to learn efficient world models. Specifically, we first
construct a physics-consistent digital twin within MPM simulator via
constitutive model selection and global-to-local optimization of physical
properties. Subsequently, we apply part-aware perturbations to the physical
properties and generate various motion patterns for the digital twin,
synthesizing extensive and diverse demonstrations. Finally, using these
demonstrations, we train a lightweight GNN-based world model that is embedded
with physical properties. The real video can be used to further refine the
physical properties. PhysWorld achieves accurate and fast future predictions
for various deformable objects, and also generalizes well to novel
interactions. Experiments show that PhysWorld has competitive performance while
enabling inference speeds 47 times faster than the recent state-of-the-art

*Shengtian Yang,Yue Feng,Yingshi Liu,Jingrou Zhang,Jie Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoniTor is a training-free online video anomaly detection method that uses vision-language models with memory-based scoring queues and LSTM-inspired prediction to identify anomalies in real-time video streams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) has been neglected due to real-time constraints and computational demands, while offline VAD has advanced with LLMs and VLMs. There's a need for effective online VAD solutions.

Method: Uses streaming input to pre-trained VLMs, incorporates LSTM-inspired prediction for temporal dependencies, and implements a scoring queue with anomaly prior to dynamically store recent scores and guide LLMs in distinguishing normal vs abnormal behaviors.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets, and is competitive with weakly supervised methods without requiring training.

Conclusion: MoniTor effectively addresses online VAD challenges through memory-based scoring and temporal modeling, demonstrating strong performance across diverse surveillance and real-world scenarios without training overhead.

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to locate unusual activities or behaviors
within videos. Recently, offline VAD has garnered substantial research
attention, which has been invigorated by the progress in large language models
(LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), offering the potential for a more
nuanced understanding of anomalies. However, online VAD has seldom received
attention due to real-time constraints and computational intensity. In this
paper, we introduce a novel Memory-based online scoring queue scheme for
Training-free VAD (MoniTor), to address the inherent complexities in online
VAD. Specifically, MoniTor applies a streaming input to VLMs, leveraging the
capabilities of pre-trained large-scale models. To capture temporal
dependencies more effectively, we incorporate a novel prediction mechanism
inspired by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This ensures the model can
effectively model past states and leverage previous predictions to identify
anomalous behaviors. Thereby, it better understands the current frame.
Moreover, we design a scoring queue and an anomaly prior to dynamically store
recent scores and cover all anomalies in the monitoring scenario, providing
guidance for LLMs to distinguish between normal and abnormal behaviors over
time. We evaluate MoniTor on two large datasets (i.e., UCF-Crime and
XD-Violence) containing various surveillance and real-world scenarios. The
results demonstrate that MoniTor outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is
competitive with weakly supervised methods without training. Code is available

*Ming Xie,Junqiu Yu,Qiaole Dong,Xiangyang Xue,Yanwei Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VidSplice is a novel video inpainting framework that decouples the task into multi-frame consistent image inpainting and masked area motion propagation, using spaced-frame priors and a CoSpliced Module to improve spatiotemporal stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video inpainting methods struggle with severe content degradation and overlook spatiotemporal stability, leading to insufficient control over video generation.

Method: Proposes VidSplice framework with spaced-frame priors, CoSpliced Module for first-frame propagation strategy, and context controller module to constrain content distortion during generation.

Result: Extensive evaluations show VidSplice achieves competitive performance across diverse video inpainting scenarios with improved foreground alignment and motion stability.

Conclusion: VidSplice outperforms existing approaches by effectively addressing spatiotemporal stability issues in video inpainting through its novel decoupled framework design.

Abstract: Recent video inpainting methods often employ image-to-video (I2V) priors to
model temporal consistency across masked frames. While effective in moderate
cases, these methods struggle under severe content degradation and tend to
overlook spatiotemporal stability, resulting in insufficient control over the
latter parts of the video. To address these limitations, we decouple video
inpainting into two sub-tasks: multi-frame consistent image inpainting and
masked area motion propagation. We propose VidSplice, a novel framework that
introduces spaced-frame priors to guide the inpainting process with
spatiotemporal cues. To enhance spatial coherence, we design a CoSpliced Module
to perform first-frame propagation strategy that diffuses the initial frame
content into subsequent reference frames through a splicing mechanism.
Additionally, we introduce a delicate context controller module that encodes
coherent priors after frame duplication and injects the spliced video into the
I2V generative backbone, effectively constraining content distortion during
generation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that VidSplice achieves
competitive performance across diverse video inpainting scenarios. Moreover,
its design significantly improves both foreground alignment and motion
stability, outperforming existing approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CXR-LanIC is a novel framework that makes chest X-ray AI diagnosis interpretable by discovering clinically relevant visual patterns through sparse autoencoders trained on diagnostic classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for chest X-ray diagnosis lack interpretability, limiting clinical adoption. Clinicians need transparent explanations to trust automated diagnoses and identify potential failures.

Method: Trains transcoder-based sparse autoencoders on BiomedCLIP diagnostic classifier to decompose medical image representations into interpretable visual patterns. Uses ensemble of 100 transcoders on MIMIC-CXR dataset embeddings.

Result: Discovers ~5,000 monosemantic patterns spanning cardiac, pulmonary, pleural, structural, device, and artifact categories. Achieves competitive diagnostic accuracy on five key findings while providing transparent attribution through interpretable patterns.

Conclusion: Medical AI systems can be both accurate and interpretable by extracting interpretable features from classifiers trained on specific diagnostic objectives, supporting safer clinical deployment through transparent explanations.

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable accuracy in chest X-ray
diagnosis, yet their widespread clinical adoption remains limited by the
black-box nature of their predictions. Clinicians require transparent,
verifiable explanations to trust automated diagnoses and identify potential
failure modes. We introduce CXR-LanIC (Language-Grounded Interpretable
Classifier for Chest X-rays), a novel framework that addresses this
interpretability challenge through task-aligned pattern discovery. Our approach
trains transcoder-based sparse autoencoders on a BiomedCLIP diagnostic
classifier to decompose medical image representations into interpretable visual
patterns. By training an ensemble of 100 transcoders on multimodal embeddings
from the MIMIC-CXR dataset, we discover approximately 5,000 monosemantic
patterns spanning cardiac, pulmonary, pleural, structural, device, and artifact
categories. Each pattern exhibits consistent activation behavior across images
sharing specific radiological features, enabling transparent attribution where
predictions decompose into 20-50 interpretable patterns with verifiable
activation galleries. CXR-LanIC achieves competitive diagnostic accuracy on
five key findings while providing the foundation for natural language
explanations through planned large multimodal model annotation. Our key
innovation lies in extracting interpretable features from a classifier trained
on specific diagnostic objectives rather than general-purpose embeddings,
ensuring discovered patterns are directly relevant to clinical decision-making,
demonstrating that medical AI systems can be both accurate and interpretable,
supporting safer clinical deployment through transparent, clinically grounded
explanations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-stream architecture that integrates tissue-level and cell-level features for fine-grained histopathology classification, using recurrent transformers for efficient cell aggregation and bidirectional attention between tissue and cellular information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pathology foundation models capture global tissue context but lack cell-level feature modeling, which is crucial for fine-grained tasks like cancer subtype classification.

Method: Proposes a dual-stream architecture with receptance-weighted key-value aggregation (a recurrent transformer) for efficient cell-level modeling and a bidirectional tissue-cell interaction module for mutual attention between cellular cues and tissue environment.

Result: Outperforms existing models on four histopathological subtype classification benchmarks, demonstrating improved performance in fine-grained computational pathology tasks.

Conclusion: Cell-level aggregation and tissue-cell interaction are critical components for accurate fine-grained histopathology analysis, addressing limitations of current foundation models.

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of histopathological images demands integration of
information across spatial and semantic scales, from nuclear morphology and
cellular textures to global tissue organization and disease-specific patterns.
Although recent foundation models in pathology have shown strong capabilities
in capturing global tissue context, their omission of cell-level feature
modeling remains a key limitation for fine-grained tasks such as cancer subtype
classification. To address this, we propose a dual-stream architecture that
models the interplay between macroscale tissue features and aggregated cellular
representations. To efficiently aggregate information from large cell sets, we
propose a receptance-weighted key-value aggregation model, a recurrent
transformer that captures inter-cell dependencies with linear complexity.
Furthermore, we introduce a bidirectional tissue-cell interaction module to
enable mutual attention between localized cellular cues and their surrounding
tissue environment. Experiments on four histopathological subtype
classification benchmarks show that the proposed method outperforms existing
models, demonstrating the critical role of cell-level aggregation and
tissue-cell interaction in fine-grained computational pathology.

videos of closed areas with overlapping multi-camera views, where person

elements of the MOT process, including feature extraction, tracking, and
community search. Furthermore, GRAP-MOT is equipped with a person's position
estimation module, which gives additional key information to the MOT method,
ensuring better results than methods without position data. We tested GRAP-MOT
on recordings acquired in a closed-area model and on publicly available real

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision encoders focus on global image representations but overlook fine-grained regional analysis, limited by scarce fine-grained annotated data and lack of fine-grained pre-training paradigms.

Method: Constructed Gran-29M dataset with 2M images and 180M region-level annotations; developed pretraining-adaptation framework with self-distillation; uses bounding-box-to-caption regression in pretraining and caption-to-bounding-box regression in adaptation.

Result: GranViT surpasses existing vision encoders, achieves strong transferability to varying LLMs, and attains state-of-the-art results on fine-grained recognition, multimodal VQA, and OCR understanding.

Conclusion: GranViT successfully addresses the fine-grained perception limitations of existing vision encoders through region-level training and demonstrates superior performance across multiple vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Vision encoders are indispensable for allowing impressive performance of
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in vision language tasks such as
visual question answering and reasoning. However, existing vision encoders
focus on global image representations but overlook fine-grained regional
analysis. They are limited in fine grained perception due to the scarcity of
fine grained annotated data and the lack of a fine grained pre-training
paradigm. In this paper, we propose GranViT, a novel Vision Transformer that
integrates fine-grained feature extraction with semantic alignment to Large
Language Models (LLMs) via region level autoregressive training. We first
construct Gran-29M, a dataset comprising 2million natural and OCR images paired
with over 180 million high-quality region-level annotations, to enable large
scale fine grained pretraining. Consequently, we develop a
pretraining-adaptation framework along with a self distillation mechanism to
train fine-grained GranViT on Gran-29M. We sufficiently exploit the
fine-grained annotations from Gran-29M to resort to bounding-box-to-caption
regression to enhance localized visual representation of the vision encoder in
the pretraining and caption-to-bounding-box regression to improve vision
feature utilization and localization for LLM in the adaptation. We further
incorporate a self distillation mechanism that imposes explicit localization
constraints on the vision encoder to strengthen its regional reasoning
capability. Extensive experiments show that GranViT surpasses existing vision
encoders and attains strong transferability to varying LLMs. Remarkably, it
achieves state-of-the-art results on fine-grained recognition, multimodal VQA,
and OCR understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Foresight Guidance (FSG), a new conditional guidance method for text-to-image diffusion models that reframes guidance as fixed point iterations and addresses inefficiencies in existing approaches like Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and improving Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is crucial for text-to-image diffusion models, but current approaches have divergent theoretical interpretations that limit design space and obscure key choices.

Method: The authors propose a unified perspective treating conditional guidance as fixed point iterations, identifying a golden path where latents produce consistent outputs. They introduce Foresight Guidance (FSG) which solves longer-interval subproblems in early diffusion stages with increased iterations.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and model architectures show FSG outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both image quality and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The work provides novel perspectives for conditional guidance and unlocks the potential of adaptive design in diffusion models.

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is an essential component of text-to-image
diffusion models, and understanding and advancing its operational mechanisms
remains a central focus of research. Existing approaches stem from divergent
theoretical interpretations, thereby limiting the design space and obscuring
key design choices. To address this, we propose a unified perspective that
reframes conditional guidance as fixed point iterations, seeking to identify a
golden path where latents produce consistent outputs under both conditional and
unconditional generation. We demonstrate that CFG and its variants constitute a
special case of single-step short-interval iteration, which is theoretically
proven to exhibit inefficiency. To this end, we introduce Foresight Guidance
(FSG), which prioritizes solving longer-interval subproblems in early diffusion
stages with increased iterations. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets
and model architectures validate the superiority of FSG over state-of-the-art
methods in both image quality and computational efficiency. Our work offers
novel perspectives for conditional guidance and unlocks the potential of
adaptive design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal mechanisms of language and vision-language models, specifically how individual attention heads specialize in semantic or visual attributes, despite impressive performance across tasks.

Method: Reinterpret probing of intermediate activations through signal processing lens, enabling principled analysis of multiple samples and ranking attention heads based on relevance to target concepts.

Result: Found consistent patterns of head-level specialization across unimodal and multimodal transformers. Editing only 1% of heads (selected via the method) reliably suppresses or enhances targeted concepts in model outputs.

Conclusion: Attention layers contain interpretable and controllable structure, providing simple tools for understanding and editing large-scale generative models, validated across language and vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Language and vision-language models have shown impressive performance across
a wide range of tasks, but their internal mechanisms remain only partly
understood. In this work, we study how individual attention heads in
text-generative models specialize in specific semantic or visual attributes.
Building on an established interpretability method, we reinterpret the practice
of probing intermediate activations with the final decoding layer through the
lens of signal processing. This lets us analyze multiple samples in a
principled way and rank attention heads based on their relevance to target
concepts. Our results show consistent patterns of specialization at the head
level across both unimodal and multimodal transformers. Remarkably, we find
that editing as few as 1% of the heads, selected using our method, can reliably
suppress or enhance targeted concepts in the model output. We validate our
approach on language tasks such as question answering and toxicity mitigation,
as well as vision-language tasks including image classification and captioning.
Our findings highlight an interpretable and controllable structure within
attention layers, offering simple tools for understanding and editing

Conclusion: The approach successfully enables video-to-Foley generation with minimal training overhead, and the bridge design shows potential for extension to other audio modalities like speech.

Abstract: Foley Control is a lightweight approach to video-guided Foley that keeps
pretrained single-modality models frozen and learns only a small
cross-attention bridge between them. We connect V-JEPA2 video embeddings to a
frozen Stable Audio Open DiT text-to-audio (T2A) model by inserting compact
video cross-attention after the model's existing text cross-attention, so
prompts set global semantics while video refines timing and local dynamics. The
frozen backbones retain strong marginals (video; audio given text) and the
bridge learns the audio-video dependency needed for synchronization -- without
retraining the audio prior. To cut memory and stabilize training, we pool video
tokens before conditioning. On curated video-audio benchmarks, Foley Control
delivers competitive temporal and semantic alignment with far fewer trainable
parameters than recent multi-modal systems, while preserving prompt-driven
controllability and production-friendly modularity (swap/upgrade encoders or
the T2A backbone without end-to-end retraining). Although we focus on
Video-to-Foley, the same bridge design can potentially extend to other audio
modalities (e.g., speech).

*Yifu Luo,Penghui Du,Bo Li,Sinan Du,Tiantian Zhang,Yongzhe Chang,Kai Wu,Kun Gai,Xueqian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Chunk-GRPO improves text-to-image generation by shifting GRPO optimization from step-level to chunk-level, addressing inaccurate advantage attribution and temporal dynamics neglect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO has limitations in flow-matching-based T2I generation: inaccurate advantage attribution and neglect of temporal dynamics in generation process.

Method: Group consecutive steps into coherent chunks that capture temporal dynamics of flow matching, optimize policies at chunk level, and optionally use weighted sampling strategy.

Result: Extensive experiments show Chunk-GRPO achieves superior results in both preference alignment and image quality compared to step-level approaches.

Conclusion: Chunk-level optimization shows promise for GRPO-based methods in text-to-image generation, effectively addressing previous limitations.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown strong potential for
flow-matching-based text-to-image (T2I) generation, but it faces two key
limitations: inaccurate advantage attribution, and the neglect of temporal
dynamics of generation. In this work, we argue that shifting the optimization
paradigm from the step level to the chunk level can effectively alleviate these
issues. Building on this idea, we propose Chunk-GRPO, the first chunk-level
GRPO-based approach for T2I generation. The insight is to group consecutive
steps into coherent 'chunk's that capture the intrinsic temporal dynamics of
flow matching, and to optimize policies at the chunk level. In addition, we
introduce an optional weighted sampling strategy to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that ChunkGRPO achieves superior
results in both preference alignment and image quality, highlighting the
promise of chunk-level optimization for GRPO-based methods.

*Xuzhao Li,Xuchen Li,Shiyu Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MATrack is a multiscale adaptive system for nighttime UAV tracking that addresses challenges like low-light conditions, cluttered backgrounds, and viewpoint changes through three core modules, achieving significant performance improvements over SOTA methods while maintaining real-time processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nighttime UAV tracking faces challenges from low-light conditions, cluttered backgrounds, and frequent viewpoint changes that cause existing trackers to drift or fail. Current solutions like low-light enhancement introduce artifacts, while domain adaptation methods are computationally expensive and lightweight designs struggle with dynamic object information.

Method: MATrack uses three core modules: Multiscale Hierarchy Blende (MHB) for feature consistency between static and dynamic templates, Adaptive Key Token Gate for identifying object information in complex backgrounds, and Nighttime Template Calibrator (NTC) for stable long-sequence tracking.

Result: On UAVDark135 benchmark, MATrack achieved 5.9% higher precision, 5.4% higher normalized precision, and 4.2% higher AUC than state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining real-time processing at 81 FPS. Real-world UAV platform tests validated the system's reliability for critical applications.

Conclusion: MATrack provides stable and effective nighttime UAV tracking support for critical robotics applications such as nighttime search and rescue and border patrol, demonstrating significant performance improvements over existing methods while maintaining real-time processing capabilities.

Abstract: Nighttime UAV tracking faces significant challenges in real-world robotics
operations. Low-light conditions not only limit visual perception capabilities,
but cluttered backgrounds and frequent viewpoint changes also cause existing
trackers to drift or fail during deployment. To address these difficulties,
researchers have proposed solutions based on low-light enhancement and domain
adaptation. However, these methods still have notable shortcomings in actual
UAV systems: low-light enhancement often introduces visual artifacts, domain
adaptation methods are computationally expensive and existing lightweight
designs struggle to fully leverage dynamic object information. Based on an
in-depth analysis of these key issues, we propose MATrack-a multiscale adaptive
system designed specifically for nighttime UAV tracking. MATrack tackles the
main technical challenges of nighttime tracking through the collaborative work
of three core modules: Multiscale Hierarchy Blende (MHB) enhances feature
consistency between static and dynamic templates. Adaptive Key Token Gate
accurately identifies object information within complex backgrounds. Nighttime
Template Calibrator (NTC) ensures stable tracking performance over long
sequences. Extensive experiments show that MATrack achieves a significant
performance improvement. On the UAVDark135 benchmark, its precision, normalized
precision and AUC surpass state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 5.9%, 5.4% and
4.2% respectively, while maintaining a real-time processing speed of 81 FPS.
Further tests on a real-world UAV platform validate the system's reliability,
demonstrating that MATrack can provide stable and effective nighttime UAV
tracking support for critical robotics applications such as nighttime search
and rescue and border patrol.

Motivation: Current generative super-resolution methods perform well on natural images but distort text, creating a fundamental trade-off between image quality and textual readability.

Method: A novel two-stage 'text-first, image-later' framework that explicitly decouples glyph restoration from image enhancement. It first reconstructs precise text structures and then uses them to guide subsequent full-image super-resolution.

Result: TIGER achieves state-of-the-art performance, enhancing readability while preserving overall image quality. The method is supported by the UltraZoom-ST dataset with extreme zoom (×14.29).

Conclusion: The glyph-to-image guidance approach ensures both high fidelity and visual consistency, successfully breaking the trade-off between image quality and text readability in super-resolution tasks.

Abstract: Current generative super-resolution methods show strong performance on

*Pauline Mouches,Julien Jung,Armand Demasson,Agnès Guinard,Romain Bouet,Rosalie Marchal,Romain Quentin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning models (ANN and CNN) can effectively detect interictal spikes in MEG recordings for epilepsy evaluation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods even with limited temporal and single-expert annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual detection of interictal epileptic spikes in MEG recordings is tedious and error-prone with moderate interrater agreement, while current automated methods are unsuitable for clinical practice due to extensive annotation requirements or lack of robustness.

Method: Proposed two deep learning architectures: feature-based ANN and CNN, trained on 59 patients' data. Used interactive machine learning strategy to iteratively improve data annotation quality using model outputs. Compared against state-of-the-art model for classifying short time windows of signal.

Result: Both proposed models outperformed state-of-the-art model (F1-scores: CNN=0.46, ANN=0.44) on 10 holdout test patients. Interactive learning demonstrated model robustness to noisy annotations.

Conclusion: Simple architecture models are robust for complex, imperfectly annotated data. Interactive machine learning enables faster data annotation, and the models represent efficient tools for automated interictal spike detection in clinical practice.

Abstract: In drug-resistant epilepsy, presurgical evaluation of epilepsy can be
considered. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has been shown to be an effective exam
to inform the localization of the epileptogenic zone through the localization
of interictal epileptic spikes. Manual detection of these pathological
biomarkers remains a fastidious and error-prone task due to the high
dimensionality of MEG recordings, and interrater agreement has been reported to
be only moderate. Current automated methods are unsuitable for clinical
practice, either requiring extensively annotated data or lacking robustness on
non-typical data. In this work, we demonstrate that deep learning models can be
used for detecting interictal spikes in MEG recordings, even when only temporal
and single-expert annotations are available, which represents real-world
clinical practice. We propose two model architectures: a feature-based
artificial neural network (ANN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN),
trained on a database of 59 patients, and evaluated against a state-of-the-art
model to classify short time windows of signal. In addition, we employ an
interactive machine learning strategy to iteratively improve our data
annotation quality using intermediary model outputs. Both proposed models
outperform the state-of-the-art model (F1-scores: CNN=0.46, ANN=0.44) when
tested on 10 holdout test patients. The interactive machine learning strategy
demonstrates that our models are robust to noisy annotations. Overall, results
highlight the robustness of models with simple architectures when analyzing
complex and imperfectly annotated data. Our method of interactive machine
learning offers great potential for faster data annotation, while our models
represent useful and efficient tools for automated interictal spikes detection.

TL;DR: S3OD method improves salient object detection generalization using large-scale synthetic data and ambiguity-aware architecture, achieving 20-50% error reduction in cross-dataset performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Salient object detection faces data limitations due to expensive pixel-precise annotations, requiring separate model training for related subtasks like DIS and HR-SOD.

Method: Multi-modal diffusion pipeline generates S3OD dataset (139,000+ high-res images) using diffusion and DINO-v3 features, with iterative framework prioritizing challenging categories. Streamlined multi-mask decoder handles ambiguity by predicting multiple valid interpretations.

Result: Models trained solely on synthetic data achieve 20-50% error reduction in cross-dataset generalization. Fine-tuned versions reach state-of-the-art performance across DIS and HR-SOD benchmarks.

Conclusion: Large-scale synthetic data generation combined with ambiguity-aware architecture dramatically improves generalization in salient object detection tasks.

Abstract: Salient object detection exemplifies data-bounded tasks where expensive
pixel-precise annotations force separate model training for related subtasks
like DIS and HR-SOD. We present a method that dramatically improves
generalization through large-scale synthetic data generation and
ambiguity-aware architecture. We introduce S3OD, a dataset of over 139,000
high-resolution images created through our multi-modal diffusion pipeline that
extracts labels from diffusion and DINO-v3 features. The iterative generation
framework prioritizes challenging categories based on model performance. We
propose a streamlined multi-mask decoder that naturally handles the inherent
ambiguity in salient object detection by predicting multiple valid
interpretations. Models trained solely on synthetic data achieve 20-50% error
reduction in cross-dataset generalization, while fine-tuned versions reach
state-of-the-art performance across DIS and HR-SOD benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Modest-Align is a lightweight cross-modal alignment framework that addresses overconfidence and performance degradation in resource-constrained settings through random perturbation and embedding smoothing strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cross-modal alignment models like CLIP suffer from overconfidence and degraded performance when operating with limited or low-quality data, particularly due to ambiguous image-text pairs and single positive pair contrastive learning.

Method: Proposes two complementary strategies: Random Perturbation (introducing controlled noise to simulate uncertainty) and Embedding Smoothing (calibrating similarity distributions in embedding space).

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in retrieval tasks, achieving competitive results with over 100x less training data and 600x less GPU time than CLIP.

Conclusion: Modest-Align offers a practical and scalable solution for cross-modal alignment in real-world, low-resource scenarios by reducing overconfidence and improving performance on noisy data.

Abstract: Cross-modal alignment aims to map heterogeneous modalities into a shared
latent space, as exemplified by models like CLIP, which benefit from
large-scale image-text pretraining for strong recognition capabilities.
However, when operating in resource-constrained settings with limited or
low-quality data, these models often suffer from overconfidence and degraded
performance due to the prevalence of ambiguous or weakly correlated image-text
pairs. Current contrastive learning approaches, which rely on single positive
pairs, further exacerbate this issue by reinforcing overconfidence on uncertain
samples. To address these challenges, we propose Modest-Align, a lightweight
alignment framework designed for robustness and efficiency. Our approach
leverages two complementary strategies -- Random Perturbation, which introduces
controlled noise to simulate uncertainty, and Embedding Smoothing, which
calibrates similarity distributions in the embedding space. These mechanisms
collectively reduce overconfidence and improve performance on noisy or weakly
aligned samples. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that Modest-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in retrieval
tasks, achieving competitive results with over 100x less training data and 600x
less GPU time than CLIP. Our method offers a practical and scalable solution
for cross-modal alignment in real-world, low-resource scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using epipolar geometry constraints to improve video diffusion models, addressing geometric inconsistencies and unstable motion through preference-based optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models struggle with geometric inconsistencies, unstable motion, and visual artifacts that break realistic 3D scene illusions, limiting their practical applications in generation and reconstruction tasks.

Method: Align diffusion models using pairwise epipolar geometry constraints via preference-based optimization, enforcing geometric principles without requiring end-to-end differentiability. Training on static scenes with dynamic cameras ensures high-quality measurements.

Result: The approach demonstrates that classical geometric constraints provide more stable optimization signals than modern learned metrics, which produce noisy targets. The model generalizes effectively to diverse dynamic content.

Conclusion: By bridging data-driven deep learning with classical geometric computer vision, this method enables practical generation of spatially consistent videos without compromising visual quality.

Abstract: Video generation models have progressed tremendously through large latent
diffusion transformers trained with rectified flow techniques. Yet these models
still struggle with geometric inconsistencies, unstable motion, and visual
artifacts that break the illusion of realistic 3D scenes. 3D-consistent video
generation could significantly impact numerous downstream applications in
generation and reconstruction tasks. We explore how epipolar geometry
constraints improve modern video diffusion models. Despite massive training
data, these models fail to capture fundamental geometric principles underlying
visual content. We align diffusion models using pairwise epipolar geometry
constraints via preference-based optimization, directly addressing unstable
camera trajectories and geometric artifacts through mathematically principled
geometric enforcement. Our approach efficiently enforces geometric principles
without requiring end-to-end differentiability. Evaluation demonstrates that
classical geometric constraints provide more stable optimization signals than
modern learned metrics, which produce noisy targets that compromise alignment
quality. Training on static scenes with dynamic cameras ensures high-quality
measurements while the model generalizes effectively to diverse dynamic
content. By bridging data-driven deep learning with classical geometric
computer vision, we present a practical method for generating spatially
consistent videos without compromising visual quality.

*Ziqi Gao,Qiufu Li,Linlin Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAP-MAE is a domain-adaptive masked autoencoder that integrates cross-domain point cloud data during pre-training while adapting to downstream tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple 3D analysis tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point cloud data is limited across different domains, and existing methods that combine cross-domain data for MAE pre-training often lead to degraded performance due to misalignment with downstream tasks.

Method: Proposes DAP-MAE with a heterogeneous domain adapter that uses adaptation mode during pre-training to learn from cross-domain data, and fusion mode during fine-tuning to enhance features. Also includes a domain feature generator to guide feature adaptation for downstream tasks.

Result: Achieves 95.18% accuracy in object classification on ScanObjectNN and 88.45% accuracy in facial expression recognition on Bosphorus, with excellent performance across four different point cloud analysis tasks using only one pre-training.

Conclusion: DAP-MAE effectively addresses the data scarcity issue in point cloud analysis by adaptively integrating cross-domain knowledge while maintaining strong performance across diverse downstream tasks.

Abstract: Compared to 2D data, the scale of point cloud data in different domains
available for training, is quite limited. Researchers have been trying to
combine these data of different domains for masked autoencoder (MAE)
pre-training to leverage such a data scarcity issue. However, the prior
knowledge learned from mixed domains may not align well with the downstream 3D
point cloud analysis tasks, leading to degraded performance. To address such an
issue, we propose the Domain-Adaptive Point Cloud Masked Autoencoder (DAP-MAE),
an MAE pre-training method, to adaptively integrate the knowledge of
cross-domain datasets for general point cloud analysis. In DAP-MAE, we design a
heterogeneous domain adapter that utilizes an adaptation mode during
pre-training, enabling the model to comprehensively learn information from
point clouds across different domains, while employing a fusion mode in the
fine-tuning to enhance point cloud features. Meanwhile, DAP-MAE incorporates a
domain feature generator to guide the adaptation of point cloud features to
various downstream tasks. With only one pre-training, DAP-MAE achieves
excellent performance across four different point cloud analysis tasks,
reaching 95.18% in object classification on ScanObjectNN and 88.45% in facial
expression recognition on Bosphorus.

*Han Yang,Guangjun Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gompertz-CNN is a dynamic knowledge distillation framework that uses the Gompertz growth model to adjust distillation loss weights based on student learning stages, achieving significant accuracy improvements over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional knowledge distillation methods fail to capture the evolving cognitive capacity of student models during training, leading to suboptimal knowledge transfer.

Method: Proposes a stage-aware distillation strategy using the Gompertz curve to dynamically adjust distillation loss weights, incorporating Wasserstein distance for feature-level discrepancies and gradient matching for backward propagation alignment.

Result: Achieves up to 8% accuracy gain on CIFAR-10 and 4% on CIFAR-100 across various teacher-student architectures like ResNet50 and MobileNet_v2, consistently outperforming traditional distillation methods.

Conclusion: The Gompertz-CNN framework effectively addresses limitations of traditional knowledge distillation by dynamically adapting to student learning progression, demonstrating superior performance across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel dynamic knowledge distillation framework,
Gompertz-CNN, which integrates the Gompertz growth model into the training
process to address the limitations of traditional knowledge distillation.
Conventional methods often fail to capture the evolving cognitive capacity of
student models, leading to suboptimal knowledge transfer. To overcome this, we
propose a stage-aware distillation strategy that dynamically adjusts the weight
of distillation loss based on the Gompertz curve, reflecting the student's
learning progression: slow initial growth, rapid mid-phase improvement, and
late-stage saturation. Our framework incorporates Wasserstein distance to
measure feature-level discrepancies and gradient matching to align backward
propagation behaviors between teacher and student models. These components are
unified under a multi-loss objective, where the Gompertz curve modulates the
influence of distillation losses over time. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10
and CIFAR-100 using various teacher-student architectures (e.g., ResNet50 and
MobileNet_v2) demonstrate that Gompertz-CNN consistently outperforms
traditional distillation methods, achieving up to 8% and 4% accuracy gains on
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Group Inertial Poser is a novel method that combines sparse wearable IMUs with UWB ranging to accurately track full-body motion and global translation for multiple individuals, overcoming limitations of purely IMU-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Purely IMU-based motion tracking has limitations in translation estimates and accurate relative positioning between individuals since inertial cues are self-referential and lack spatial reference for others.

Method: The method estimates absolute distances between sensor pairs using UWB ranging and fuses them with inertial observations in structured state-space models. It uses a novel two-step optimization to leverage estimated distances for accurate global trajectory tracking.

Result: Group Inertial Poser outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness across synthetic and real-world data. The authors also introduced GIP-DB, the first IMU+UWB dataset for two-person tracking with 200 minutes of recordings from 14 participants.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for IMU+UWB-based multi-human motion capture in the wild, enabling robust estimation of body poses and global translation for multiple individuals using sparse wearable sensors.

Abstract: Tracking human full-body motion using sparse wearable inertial measurement
units (IMUs) overcomes the limitations of occlusion and instrumentation of the
environment inherent in vision-based approaches. However, purely IMU-based
tracking compromises translation estimates and accurate relative positioning
between individuals, as inertial cues are inherently self-referential and
provide no direct spatial reference for others. In this paper, we present a
novel approach for robustly estimating body poses and global translation for
multiple individuals by leveraging the distances between sparse wearable
sensors - both on each individual and across multiple individuals. Our method
Group Inertial Poser estimates these absolute distances between pairs of
sensors from ultra-wideband ranging (UWB) and fuses them with inertial
observations as input into structured state-space models to integrate temporal
motion patterns for precise 3D pose estimation. Our novel two-step optimization
further leverages the estimated distances for accurately tracking people's
global trajectories through the world. We also introduce GIP-DB, the first
IMU+UWB dataset for two-person tracking, which comprises 200 minutes of motion
recordings from 14 participants. In our evaluation, Group Inertial Poser
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness across

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Systematic study of Long-Tail Recognition methods for wildlife species classification on the NACTI dataset, achieving 99.40% Top-1 accuracy and improved generalization under domain shift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The NACTI dataset exhibits severe long-tailed class imbalance (largest class covers >50% of 3.7M images), requiring specialized methods to handle rare species recognition.

Method: Experiments with various LTR loss functions and LTR-sensitive regularization on PyTorch Wildlife model, with evaluation on both NACTI test data and Reduced-Bias Test set from ENA-Detection dataset.

Result: Best configuration achieved 99.40% Top-1 accuracy (vs 95.51% baseline), and 52.55% accuracy on domain-shifted test set (vs 51.20% with WCE loss), demonstrating improved generalization.

Conclusion: LTR-enhancing methods consistently improve wildlife recognition, particularly when combined with state-of-the-art LTR losses, though limitations remain for tail classes under severe domain shift.

Abstract: As most ''in the wild'' data collections of the natural world, the North
America Camera Trap Images (NACTI) dataset shows severe long-tailed class
imbalance, noting that the largest 'Head' class alone covers >50% of the 3.7M
images in the corpus. Building on the PyTorch Wildlife model, we present a
systematic study of Long-Tail Recognition methodologies for species recognition
on the NACTI dataset covering experiments on various LTR loss functions plus
LTR-sensitive regularisation. Our best configuration achieves 99.40% Top-1
accuracy on our NACTI test data split, substantially improving over a 95.51%
baseline using standard cross-entropy with Adam. This also improves on
previously reported top performance in MLWIC2 at 96.8% albeit using partly
unpublished (potentially different) partitioning, optimiser, and evaluation
protocols. To evaluate domain shifts (e.g. night-time captures, occlusion,
motion-blur) towards other datasets we construct a Reduced-Bias Test set from
the ENA-Detection dataset where our experimentally optimised long-tail enhanced
model achieves leading 52.55% accuracy (up from 51.20% with WCE loss),
demonstrating stronger generalisation capabilities under distribution shift. We
document the consistent improvements of LTR-enhancing scheduler choices in this
NACTI wildlife domain, particularly when in tandem with state-of-the-art LTR
losses. We finally discuss qualitative and quantitative shortcomings that LTR
methods cannot sufficiently address, including catastrophic breakdown for
'Tail' classes under severe domain shift. For maximum reproducibility we
publish all dataset splits, key code, and full network weights.

*Aarav Shetty,Gary B Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents an unsupervised method for classifying synapses in EM images based on spatial proximity similarity, without requiring predefined classes or labeled training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional synapse classification requires supervised learning with labeled examples, which limits flexibility and requires knowing the number of synapse types in advance.

Method: Uses spatial proximity principle - nearby synapses in the same neuron are more similar than random synapses from different cells. Applied to Drosophila data without requiring predefined synapse types.

Result: Successfully separates synapses into classes based on structural similarity without prior knowledge of the number of synapse types.

Conclusion: This unsupervised approach provides a principled way to identify synapse types and select ground-truth data that spans the full range of synapse structures.

Abstract: Separating synapses into different classes based on their appearance in EM
images has many applications in biology. Examples may include assigning a
neurotransmitter to a particular class, or separating synapses whose strength
can be modulated from those whose strength is fixed. Traditionally, this has
been done in a supervised manner, giving the classification algorithm examples
of the different classes. Here we instead separate synapses into classes based
only on the observation that nearby synapses in the same neuron are likely more
similar than synapses chosen randomly from different cells. We apply our
methodology to data from {\it Drosophila}. Our approach has the advantage that
the number of synapse types does not need to be known in advance. It may also
provide a principled way to select ground-truth that spans the range of synapse
structure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid generation of whole-slide images in dermatopathology requires automated methods for efficient processing and accurate classification.

Method: Used UNI and Virchow2 as feature extractors, aggregated patch-level embeddings into slide-level features using mean-aggregation, and trained multiple classifiers (logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees, random forest).

Result: Virchow2 outperformed UNI across most classifiers, with logistic regression achieving 90% accuracy for Virchow2 (difference not statistically significant). Mean-aggregation provided reliable slide-level features.

Conclusion: Foundation models show potential for automated WSI classification, providing a scalable approach for dermatopathological diagnosis and paving the way for slide-level representation learning advancements.

Abstract: The rapid generation of whole-slide images (WSIs) in dermatopathology
necessitates automated methods for efficient processing and accurate
classification. This study evaluates the performance of two foundation models,
UNI and Virchow2, as feature extractors for classifying WSIs into three
diagnostic categories: melanocytic, basaloid, and squamous lesions. Patch-level
embeddings were aggregated into slide-level features using a mean-aggregation
strategy and subsequently used to train multiple machine learning classifiers,
including logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees, and random forest
models. Performance was assessed using precision, recall, true positive rate,
false positive rate, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUROC) on the test set. Results demonstrate that patch-level features
extracted using Virchow2 outperformed those extracted via UNI across most
slide-level classifiers, with logistic regression achieving the highest
accuracy (90%) for Virchow2, though the difference was not statistically
significant. The study also explored data augmentation techniques and image
normalization to enhance model robustness and generalizability. The
mean-aggregation approach provided reliable slide-level feature
representations. All experimental results and metrics were tracked and
visualized using WandB.ai, facilitating reproducibility and interpretability.
This research highlights the potential of foundation models for automated WSI
classification, providing a scalable and effective approach for
dermatopathological diagnosis while paving the way for future advancements in
slide-level representation learning.

TL;DR: WorldGrow is a hierarchical framework for generating infinitely extendable 3D worlds with coherent geometry and realistic appearance, addressing limitations of existing 2D-lifting, 3D implicit representations, and object-centric foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods face challenges: 2D-lifting approaches have geometric and appearance inconsistencies, 3D implicit representations are hard to scale up, and current 3D foundation models are mostly object-centric, limiting scene-level generation.

Method: Leverages strong generation priors from pre-trained 3D models with three core components: (1) data curation pipeline for high-quality scene blocks, (2) 3D block inpainting for context-aware scene extension, and (3) coarse-to-fine generation strategy for global layout plausibility and local fidelity.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in geometry reconstruction on 3D-FRONT dataset and uniquely supports infinite scene generation with photorealistic and structurally consistent outputs.

Conclusion: WorldGrow demonstrates capability for constructing large-scale virtual environments and has potential for building future world models.

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of generating the infinitely extendable 3D world --
large, continuous environments with coherent geometry and realistic appearance.
Existing methods face key challenges: 2D-lifting approaches suffer from
geometric and appearance inconsistencies across views, 3D implicit
representations are hard to scale up, and current 3D foundation models are
mostly object-centric, limiting their applicability to scene-level generation.
Our key insight is leveraging strong generation priors from pre-trained 3D
models for structured scene block generation. To this end, we propose
WorldGrow, a hierarchical framework for unbounded 3D scene synthesis. Our
method features three core components: (1) a data curation pipeline that
extracts high-quality scene blocks for training, making the 3D structured
latent representations suitable for scene generation; (2) a 3D block inpainting
mechanism that enables context-aware scene extension; and (3) a coarse-to-fine
generation strategy that ensures both global layout plausibility and local
geometric/textural fidelity. Evaluated on the large-scale 3D-FRONT dataset,
WorldGrow achieves SOTA performance in geometry reconstruction, while uniquely
supporting infinite scene generation with photorealistic and structurally
consistent outputs. These results highlight its capability for constructing
large-scale virtual environments and potential for building future world
models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper applies post-hoc explainability methods to neural network-based pinniped detection in aerial imagery to build trust and identify model limitations for ecological monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of trust in black-box neural network models for ecological research and conservation monitoring by providing evidence for predictions and documenting deployment limitations.

Method: Trained Faster R-CNN on aerial imagery from Glacier Bay National Park to detect harbor seals, then applied multiple explanation methods: gradient-based class activation mapping (HiResCAM, LayerCAM), LIME, and perturbation-based explanations.

Result: Explanations focused on seal torsos and contours rather than background, and removal of seals reduced detection confidence. Analysis revealed systematic errors including confusion between seals and black ice/rocks.

Conclusion: Pairing object detection with post-hoc explainability enables moving beyond black-box predictions toward auditable, decision-supporting tools for conservation monitoring, with actionable next steps for model improvement.

Abstract: Computer vision can accelerate ecological research and conservation
monitoring, yet adoption in ecology lags in part because of a lack of trust in
black-box neural-network-based models. We seek to address this challenge by
applying post-hoc explanations to provide evidence for predictions and document
limitations that are important to field deployment. Using aerial imagery from
Glacier Bay National Park, we train a Faster R-CNN to detect pinnipeds (harbor
seals) and generate explanations via gradient-based class activation mapping
(HiResCAM, LayerCAM), local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME),
and perturbation-based explanations. We assess explanations along three axes
relevant to field use: (i) localization fidelity: whether high-attribution
regions coincide with the animal rather than background context; (ii)
faithfulness: whether deletion/insertion tests produce changes in detector
confidence; and (iii) diagnostic utility: whether explanations reveal
systematic failure modes. Explanations concentrate on seal torsos and contours
rather than surrounding ice/rock, and removal of the seals reduces detection
confidence, providing model-evidence for true positives. The analysis also
uncovers recurrent error sources, including confusion between seals and black
ice and rocks. We translate these findings into actionable next steps for model
development, including more targeted data curation and augmentation. By pairing
object detection with post-hoc explainability, we can move beyond "black-box"
predictions toward auditable, decision-supporting tools for conservation
monitoring.

### [70] [BachVid: Training-Free Video Generation with Consistent Background and Character](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21696)
*Han Yan,Xibin Song,Yifu Wang,Hongdong Li,Pan Ji,Chao Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BachVid is a training-free method for consistent video generation that achieves both character and background consistency across multiple videos without reference images or additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for consistent video generation rely on reference images or extensive training, and typically only address character consistency while leaving background consistency to image-to-video models.

Method: The approach analyzes DiT's attention mechanism and intermediate features to extract foreground masks and identify matching points during denoising. It generates an identity video, caches intermediate variables, and injects them into corresponding positions in new videos.

Result: Experimental results show BachVid achieves robust consistency in generated videos without requiring additional training.

Conclusion: BachVid offers a novel and efficient solution for consistent video generation that works without reference images or additional training.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently driven significant progress in
text-to-video (T2V) generation. However, generating multiple videos with
consistent characters and backgrounds remains a significant challenge. Existing
methods typically rely on reference images or extensive training, and often
only address character consistency, leaving background consistency to
image-to-video models. We introduce BachVid, the first training-free method
that achieves consistent video generation without needing any reference images.
Our approach is based on a systematic analysis of DiT's attention mechanism and
intermediate features, revealing its ability to extract foreground masks and
identify matching points during the denoising process. Our method leverages
this finding by first generating an identity video and caching the intermediate
variables, and then inject these cached variables into corresponding positions
in newly generated videos, ensuring both foreground and background consistency
across multiple videos. Experimental results demonstrate that BachVid achieves
robust consistency in generated videos without requiring additional training,
offering a novel and efficient solution for consistent video generation without
relying on reference images or additional training.

*Nir Goren,Shai Yehezkel,Omer Dahary,Andrey Voynov,Or Patashnik,Daniel Cohen-Or*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Visual diffusion models can solve geometric problems by treating them as image generation tasks, successfully addressing the Inscribed Square Problem, Steiner Tree Problem, and Simple Polygon Problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that visual diffusion models can directly reason about geometric problems in pixel space, bridging generative modeling with geometric problem solving without requiring specialized architectures.

Method: Treat geometric problem instances as images and train standard visual diffusion models to transform Gaussian noise into images representing valid approximate solutions, recasting geometric reasoning as image generation.

Result: Successfully solved three hard geometric problems: the Inscribed Square Problem, Steiner Tree Problem, and Simple Polygon Problem using standard visual diffusion models operating on visual representations.

Conclusion: Operating in image space provides a general framework for approximating notoriously hard geometric problems and opens doors to tackling a wider class of challenging geometric tasks.

Abstract: In this paper we show that visual diffusion models can serve as effective
geometric solvers: they can directly reason about geometric problems by working
in pixel space. We first demonstrate this on the Inscribed Square Problem, a
long-standing problem in geometry that asks whether every Jordan curve contains
four points forming a square. We then extend the approach to two other
well-known hard geometric problems: the Steiner Tree Problem and the Simple
Polygon Problem.
  Our method treats each problem instance as an image and trains a standard
visual diffusion model that transforms Gaussian noise into an image
representing a valid approximate solution that closely matches the exact one.
The model learns to transform noisy geometric structures into correct
configurations, effectively recasting geometric reasoning as image generation.
  Unlike prior work that necessitates specialized architectures and
domain-specific adaptations when applying diffusion to parametric geometric
representations, we employ a standard visual diffusion model that operates on
the visual representation of the problem. This simplicity highlights a
surprising bridge between generative modeling and geometric problem solving.
Beyond the specific problems studied here, our results point toward a broader
paradigm: operating in image space provides a general and practical framework
for approximating notoriously hard problems, and opens the door to tackling a
far wider class of challenging geometric tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An automated framework using self-reflective agents to detect visual attribute dependencies in vision models through iterative hypothesis generation and testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To detect unintended reliance on specific visual features in vision models, which is critical for ensuring robustness, preventing overfitting, and avoiding spurious correlations.

Method: A self-reflective agent that systematically generates and tests hypotheses about visual attributes, iteratively refining hypotheses based on experimental outcomes and using self-evaluation to assess findings.

Result: The approach was evaluated on 130 models across 18 categories, showing consistent performance improvement with self-reflection and significant gains over non-reflective baselines. Successfully identified dependencies in CLIP's vision encoder and YOLOv8 object detector.

Conclusion: Self-reflective agents can effectively detect visual attribute dependencies in vision models, providing an automated framework for understanding model behavior and improving robustness.

Abstract: When a vision model performs image recognition, which visual attributes drive
its predictions? Detecting unintended reliance on specific visual features is
critical for ensuring model robustness, preventing overfitting, and avoiding
spurious correlations. We introduce an automated framework for detecting such
dependencies in trained vision models. At the core of our method is a
self-reflective agent that systematically generates and tests hypotheses about
visual attributes that a model may rely on. This process is iterative: the
agent refines its hypotheses based on experimental outcomes and uses a
self-evaluation protocol to assess whether its findings accurately explain
model behavior. When inconsistencies arise, the agent self-reflects over its
findings and triggers a new cycle of experimentation. We evaluate our approach
on a novel benchmark of 130 models designed to exhibit diverse visual attribute
dependencies across 18 categories. Our results show that the agent's
performance consistently improves with self-reflection, with a significant
performance increase over non-reflective baselines. We further demonstrate that
the agent identifies real-world visual attribute dependencies in
state-of-the-art models, including CLIP's vision encoder and the YOLOv8 object
detector.

*Phat Tran,Enbai Kuang,Fred Xu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Machine learning applied to Ultrasound Tissue Pulsatility Imaging can detect intracranial hemorrhage in traumatic brain injury patients with 98% accuracy, offering a portable alternative to CT/MRI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diagnostic methods (CT/MRI) for intracranial hemorrhage in TBI are expensive, have limited availability, and depend on infrastructure, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained environments.

Method: Used ultrasound TPI signals with preprocessing (z-score normalization, PCA for dimensionality reduction) and evaluated multiple ML classifiers across different feature representations including original 31D space, reduced subset, and PCA-transformed space.

Result: PCA transformation significantly improved performance, with ensemble methods achieving 98.0% accuracy and F1-score of 0.890, effectively handling class imbalance.

Conclusion: Machine learning-based ICH detection using portable ultrasound is feasible and has applications in emergency medicine, rural healthcare, and military settings where traditional imaging is unavailable.

Abstract: Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) secondary to Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)
represents a critical diagnostic challenge, with approximately 64,000
TBI-related deaths annually in the United States. Current diagnostic modalities
including Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) have
significant limitations: high cost, limited availability, and infrastructure
dependence, particularly in resource-constrained environments. This study
investigates machine learning approaches for automated ICH detection using
Ultrasound Tissue Pulsatility Imaging (TPI), a portable technique measuring
tissue displacement from hemodynamic forces during cardiac cycles. We analyze
ultrasound TPI signals comprising 30 temporal frames per cardiac cycle with
recording angle information, collected from TBI patients with CT-confirmed
ground truth labels. Our preprocessing pipeline employs z-score normalization
and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, retaining
components explaining 95% of cumulative variance. We systematically evaluate
multiple classification algorithms spanning probabilistic, kernel-based, neural
network, and ensemble learning approaches across three feature representations:
original 31-dimensional space, reduced subset, and PCA-transformed space.
Results demonstrate that PCA transformation substantially improves classifier
performance, with ensemble methods achieving 98.0% accuracy and F1-score of
0.890, effectively balancing precision and recall despite class imbalance.
These findings establish the feasibility of machine learning-based ICH
detection in TBI patients using portable ultrasound devices, with applications
in emergency medicine, rural healthcare, and military settings where
traditional imaging is unavailable.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Eye tracking study shows that bounding-box displays in chest radiograph interpretation prolong interpretation time, increase lesion dwell time and gaze-path length, but reduce time to first fixation on lesions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify how concurrent reader displays like bounding-box highlights affect visual search behavior during chest radiograph interpretation using eye tracking.

Method: 180 chest radiographs (120 with nodules/masses, 60 without) were interpreted by 3 radiologists twice - with and without bounding boxes. Eye movements were recorded and analyzed using linear mixed models on true positive cases.

Result: Bounding-box displays prolonged interpretation time by 4.9s, increased lesion dwell time by 1.3s, increased gaze-path length by 2,076 pixels, increased lung-field coverage by 10.5%, and reduced time to first fixation on lesions by 1.3s.

Conclusion: Eye tracking can detect measurable changes in search behavior with bounding-box displays, supporting feasibility of this approach and need for larger studies to confirm effects across modalities.

Abstract: Rationale and Objectives: Computer-aided detection systems for chest
radiographs are widely used, and concurrent reader displays, such as
bounding-box (BB) highlights, may influence the reading process. This pilot
study used eye tracking to conduct a preliminary experiment to quantify which
aspects of visual search were affected. Materials and Methods: We sampled 180
chest radiographs from the VinDR-CXR dataset: 120 with solitary pulmonary
nodules or masses and 60 without. The BBs were configured to yield an overall
display sensitivity and specificity of 80%. Three radiologists (with 11, 5, and
1 years of experience, respectively) interpreted each case twice - once with
BBs visible and once without - after a washout of >= 2 weeks. Eye movements
were recorded using an EyeTech VT3 Mini. Metrics included interpretation time,
time to first fixation on the lesion, lesion dwell time, total gaze-path
length, and lung-field coverage ratio. Outcomes were modeled using a linear
mixed model, with reading condition as a fixed effect and case and reader as
random intercepts. The primary analysis was restricted to true positives
(n=96). Results: Concurrent BB display prolonged interpretation time by 4.9 s
(p<0.001) and increased lesion dwell time by 1.3 s (p<0.001). Total gaze-path
length increased by 2,076 pixels (p<0.001), and lung-field coverage ratio
increased by 10.5% (p<0.001). Time to first fixation on the lesion was reduced
by 1.3 s (p<0.001). Conclusion: Eye tracking captured measurable alterations in
search behavior associated with concurrent BB displays during chest radiograph
interpretation. These findings support the feasibility of this approach and
highlight the need for larger studies to confirm effects and explore
implications across modalities and clinical contexts.

*Mohammad Mahdi Danesh Pajouh,Sara Saeedi*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposed an ensemble-based segmentation method combining three architectures (SegResNet, attention-augmented SegResNet, and dual-decoder U-Net) for meningioma segmentation from MRI scans, achieving competitive performance with reduced training demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Meningiomas are common brain tumors requiring accurate MRI segmentation for treatment, but current deep learning methods are computationally intensive and inaccessible for researchers with limited hardware.

Method: Ensemble approach combining three architectures: baseline SegResNet, attention-augmented SegResNet with concatenative skip connections, and dual-decoder U-Net with attention-gated skip connections. Each model trained for only 20 epochs.

Result: Achieved average Lesion-Wise Dice scores of 77.30% (ET), 76.37% (TC), and 73.9% (WT) on BraTS-MEN 2025 test dataset, demonstrating competitive performance despite limited training.

Conclusion: The ensemble method provides an effective and accessible tool for meningioma segmentation that works well under hardware constraints, with potential clinical and research applications.

Abstract: Meningiomas represent the most prevalent form of primary brain tumors,
comprising nearly one-third of all diagnosed cases. Accurate delineation of
these tumors from MRI scans is crucial for guiding treatment strategies, yet
remains a challenging and time-consuming task in clinical practice. Recent
developments in deep learning have accelerated progress in automated tumor
segmentation; however, many advanced techniques are hindered by heavy
computational demands and long training schedules, making them less accessible
for researchers and clinicians working with limited hardware. In this work, we
propose a novel ensemble-based segmentation approach that combines three
distinct architectures: (1) a baseline SegResNet model, (2) an
attention-augmented SegResNet with concatenative skip connections, and (3) a
dual-decoder U-Net enhanced with attention-gated skip connections (DDUNet). The
ensemble aims to leverage architectural diversity to improve robustness and
accuracy while significantly reducing training demands. Each baseline model was
trained for only 20 epochs and Evaluated on the BraTS-MEN 2025 dataset. The
proposed ensemble model achieved competitive performance, with average
Lesion-Wise Dice scores of 77.30%, 76.37% and 73.9% on test dataset for
Enhancing Tumor (ET), Tumor Core (TC) and Whole Tumor (WT) respectively. These
results highlight the effectiveness of ensemble learning for brain tumor
segmentation, even under limited hardware constraints. Our proposed method
provides a practical and accessible tool for aiding the diagnosis of
meningioma, with potential impact in both clinical and research settings.

TL;DR: A human-in-the-loop pipeline converts hand-drawn floor plan sketches into 3D BIM models using multimodal LLMs in a multi-agent framework with iterative feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make BIM creation accessible to both experts and non-experts using only freehand sketches, eliminating the need for technical expertise in BIM software.

Method: Uses multimodal LLMs in multi-agent framework for perceptual extraction, human feedback, schema validation, and automated BIM scripting. Converts sketches to structured JSON layouts, then generates executable BIM scripts.

Result: Experiments on 10 floor plans show strong convergence: openings captured with high reliability initially, wall detection starts at 83% and reaches near-perfect alignment after feedback. All metrics (precision, recall, F1) above 0.83, geometric errors decrease to zero.

Conclusion: MLLM-driven multi-agent reasoning successfully enables BIM creation from freehand sketches, making the process accessible to users without technical BIM expertise.

Abstract: This study introduces a human-in-the-loop pipeline that converts unscaled,
hand-drawn floor plan sketches into semantically consistent 3D BIM models. The
workflow leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) within a
multi-agent framework, combining perceptual extraction, human feedback, schema
validation, and automated BIM scripting. Initially, sketches are iteratively
refined into a structured JSON layout of walls, doors, and windows. Later,
these layouts are transformed into executable scripts that generate 3D BIM
models. Experiments on ten diverse floor plans demonstrate strong convergence:
openings (doors, windows) are captured with high reliability in the initial
pass, while wall detection begins around 83% and achieves near-perfect
alignment after a few feedback iterations. Across all categories, precision,
recall, and F1 scores remain above 0.83, and geometric errors (RMSE, MAE)
progressively decrease to zero through feedback corrections. This study
demonstrates how MLLM-driven multi-agent reasoning can make BIM creation
accessible to both experts and non-experts using only freehand sketches.

TL;DR: The Cultural Alien Sampler (CAS) method separates compositional fit from cultural typicality to generate original yet coherent ideas in art domains, outperforming baselines and matching human art students in creativity metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle to generate ideas that are both original and coherent in open-ended domains like art - they either default to familiar cultural patterns or sacrifice coherence when pushed toward novelty.

Method: CAS uses two GPT-2 models fine-tuned on WikiArt: a Concept Coherence Model that scores concept plausibility within artworks, and a Cultural Context Model that estimates typicality within artists' work. It selects combinations high in coherence but low in typicality.

Result: Human evaluation (N=100) showed CAS outperforms random selection and GPT-4o baselines, achieving performance comparable to human art students in both originality and harmony. Quantitative analysis revealed more diverse outputs and broader conceptual exploration than GPT-4o.

Conclusion: Artificial cultural alienness can unlock creative potential in autonomous agents by maintaining internal consistency while deviating from learned conventions and cultural context.

Abstract: In open-ended domains like art, autonomous agents must generate ideas that
are both original and internally coherent, yet current Large Language Models
(LLMs) either default to familiar cultural patterns or sacrifice coherence when
pushed toward novelty. We address this by introducing the Cultural Alien
Sampler (CAS), a concept-selection method that explicitly separates
compositional fit from cultural typicality. CAS uses two GPT-2 models
fine-tuned on WikiArt concepts: a Concept Coherence Model that scores whether
concepts plausibly co-occur within artworks, and a Cultural Context Model that
estimates how typical those combinations are within individual artists' bodies
of work. CAS targets combinations that are high in coherence and low in
typicality, yielding ideas that maintain internal consistency while deviating
from learned conventions and embedded cultural context. In a human evaluation
(N = 100), our approach outperforms random selection and GPT-4o baselines and
achieves performance comparable to human art students in both perceived
originality and harmony. Additionally, a quantitative study shows that our
method produces more diverse outputs and explores a broader conceptual space
than its GPT-4o counterpart, demonstrating that artificial cultural alienness
can unlock creative potential in autonomous agents.

*Krzysztof Siminski*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes extensional fuzzy numbers as an alternative to traditional fuzzy sets to address computational complexity and shape preservation issues in fuzzy number operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fuzzy number operations using Zadeh's extension rule have high computational complexity, don't preserve fuzzy set shapes (e.g., triangular fuzzy sets don't remain triangular after multiplication), and suffer from fuzzy spread where fuzziness increases with operations, limiting practical applications.

Method: The paper introduces extensional fuzzy numbers with defined operations and relational operators (=, >, >=, <, <=), providing a C++ implementation available in a public GitHub repository.

Result: The proposed approach is demonstrated through several application examples, showing that extensional fuzzy numbers overcome the limitations of traditional fuzzy set representations.

Conclusion: Extensional fuzzy numbers provide a viable alternative to traditional fuzzy sets for representing imprecise data, addressing key computational and structural limitations while maintaining practical applicability.

Abstract: Fuzzy numbers are commonly represented with fuzzy sets. Their objective is to
better represent imprecise data. However, operations on fuzzy numbers are not
as straightforward as maths on crisp numbers. Commonly, the Zadeh's extension
rule is applied to elaborate a result. This can produce two problems: (1) high
computational complexity and (2) for some fuzzy sets and some operations the
results is not a fuzzy set with the same features (eg. multiplication of two
triangular fuzzy sets does not produce a triangular fuzzy set). One more
problem is the fuzzy spread -- fuzziness of the result increases with the
number of operations. These facts can severely limit the application field of
fuzzy numbers. In this paper we would like to revisite this problem with a
different kind of fuzzy numbers -- extensional fuzzy numbers. The paper defines
operations on extensional fuzzy numbers and relational operators (=, >, >=, <,
<=) for them. The proposed approach is illustrated with several applicational
examples. The C++ implementation is available from a public GitHub repository.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework using customized open-source LLMs to extract and standardize MOUD prescription data from heterogeneous EHR systems, achieving high accuracy in computing medication coverage metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Harmonizing medication data across different EHR systems is challenging due to scattered prescription attributes in various formats and freetext notes, hindering consistent monitoring of MOUD treatments.

Method: Customize open-source LLMs (Llama, Qwen, Gemma, MedGemma) to extract MOUD prescription attributes from EHR data, process records in fixed JSON schema, perform normalization and consistency checks, and compute standardized MOUD days metric.

Result: Qwen2.5-32B achieved 93.4% coverage with 93.0% exact-match accuracy, MedGemma-27B attained 93.1%/92.2% on 25,605 records from 1,257 patients across five clinics.

Conclusion: The approach successfully removes site-specific ETL requirements, enables privacy-preserving deployment, and supports consistent cross-site analyses of MOUD exposure, adherence, and retention in real-world settings.

Abstract: Harmonizing medication data across Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems is
a persistent barrier to monitoring medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD).
In heterogeneous EHR systems, key prescription attributes are scattered across
differently formatted fields and freetext notes. We present a practical
framework that customizes open source large language models (LLMs), including
Llama, Qwen, Gemma, and MedGemma, to extract a unified set of MOUD prescription
attributes (prescription date, drug name, duration, total quantity, daily
quantity, and refills) from heterogeneous, site specific data and compute a
standardized metric of medication coverage, \emph{MOUD days}, per patient. Our
pipeline processes records directly in a fixed JSON schema, followed by
lightweight normalization and cross-field consistency checks. We evaluate the
system on prescription level EHR data from five clinics in a national OUD study
(25{,}605 records from 1{,}257 patients), using a previously annotated
benchmark of 10{,}369 records (776 patients) as the ground truth. Performance
is reported as coverage (share of records with a valid, matchable output) and
record-level exact-match accuracy. Larger models perform best overall:
Qwen2.5-32B achieves \textbf{93.4\%} coverage with \textbf{93.0\%} exact-match
accuracy across clinics, and MedGemma-27B attains
\textbf{93.1\%}/\textbf{92.2\%}. A brief error review highlights three common
issues and fixes: imputing missing dosage fields using within-drug norms,
handling monthly/weekly injectables (e.g., Vivitrol) by setting duration from
the documented schedule, and adding unit checks to prevent mass units (e.g.,
``250 g'') from being misread as daily counts. By removing brittle,
site-specific ETL and supporting local, privacy-preserving deployment, this
approach enables consistent cross-site analyses of MOUD exposure, adherence,
and retention in real-world settings.

### [80] [Epistemic Deference to AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21043)
*Benjamin Lange*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues against AI Preemptionism (deferring to AI outputs as replacements for human judgment) and proposes a total evidence view where AI outputs serve as contributory reasons alongside human expertise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine when we should defer to AI outputs over human expert judgment, addressing concerns about AI's opacity, self-reinforcing authority, and lack of failure markers.

Method: Draws on social epistemology to analyze AI systems as Artificial Epistemic Authorities (AEAs), critiques AI Preemptionism, and develops a total evidence view of AI deference.

Result: Identifies amplified problems with AI Preemptionism and proposes a superior alternative that treats AI outputs as contributory reasons rather than replacements for human judgment.

Conclusion: The total evidence view offers a principled approach to justified AI deference, particularly in high-stakes contexts, by maintaining human engagement, supporting meaningful oversight, and explaining justified mistrust when reliability conditions are unmet.

Abstract: When should we defer to AI outputs over human expert judgment? Drawing on
recent work in social epistemology, I motivate the idea that some AI systems
qualify as Artificial Epistemic Authorities (AEAs) due to their demonstrated
reliability and epistemic superiority. I then introduce AI Preemptionism, the
view that AEA outputs should replace rather than supplement a user's
independent epistemic reasons. I show that classic objections to preemptionism
- such as uncritical deference, epistemic entrenchment, and unhinging epistemic
bases - apply in amplified form to AEAs, given their opacity, self-reinforcing
authority, and lack of epistemic failure markers. Against this, I develop a
more promising alternative: a total evidence view of AI deference. According to
this view, AEA outputs should function as contributory reasons rather than
outright replacements for a user's independent epistemic considerations. This
approach has three key advantages: (i) it mitigates expertise atrophy by
keeping human users engaged, (ii) it provides an epistemic case for meaningful
human oversight and control, and (iii) it explains the justified mistrust of AI
when reliability conditions are unmet. While demanding in practice, this
account offers a principled way to determine when AI deference is justified,
particularly in high-stakes contexts requiring rigorous reliability.

*Ali Khosravi Kazazi,Zhenlong Li,M. Naser Lessani,Guido Cervone*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent framework for translating natural language to spatial SQL queries, achieving 87.7% accuracy on spatial queries through specialized agents and self-verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the complexity of SQL and geospatial functions that create barriers for non-experts in spatial data analysis, addressing limitations of single-agent LLM approaches for spatial queries.

Method: Multi-agent framework with knowledge base, embeddings for context retrieval, and specialized agents for entity extraction, metadata retrieval, query logic formulation, SQL generation, plus a review agent for programmatic and semantic validation.

Result: Achieved 81.2% overall accuracy on KaggleDBQA (221/272 questions) and 87.7% accuracy on spatial queries (79/90 questions), compared to 76.7% without the review agent. System sometimes generates queries more semantically aligned with user intent than benchmark queries.

Conclusion: The framework makes spatial analysis more accessible and provides a robust foundation for spatial Text-to-SQL systems, advancing autonomous GIS development.

Abstract: The complexity of Structured Query Language (SQL) and the specialized nature
of geospatial functions in tools like PostGIS present significant barriers to
non-experts seeking to analyze spatial data. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
offer promise for translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL),
single-agent approaches often struggle with the semantic and syntactic
complexities of spatial queries. To address this, we propose a multi-agent
framework designed to accurately translate natural language questions into
spatial SQL queries. The framework integrates several innovative components,
including a knowledge base with programmatic schema profiling and semantic
enrichment, embeddings for context retrieval, and a collaborative multi-agent
pipeline as its core. This pipeline comprises specialized agents for entity
extraction, metadata retrieval, query logic formulation, SQL generation, and a
review agent that performs programmatic and semantic validation of the
generated SQL to ensure correctness (self-verification). We evaluate our system
using both the non-spatial KaggleDBQA benchmark and a new, comprehensive
SpatialQueryQA benchmark that includes diverse geometry types, predicates, and
three levels of query complexity. On KaggleDBQA, the system achieved an overall
accuracy of 81.2% (221 out of 272 questions) after the review agent's review
and corrections. For spatial queries, the system achieved an overall accuracy
of 87.7% (79 out of 90 questions), compared with 76.7% without the review
agent. Beyond accuracy, results also show that in some instances the system
generates queries that are more semantically aligned with user intent than
those in the benchmarks. This work makes spatial analysis more accessible, and
provides a robust, generalizable foundation for spatial Text-to-SQL systems,
advancing the development of autonomous GIS.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MedAlign is a framework that addresses hallucinations, inefficient reasoning, and multi-institutional collaboration challenges in medical LVLMs through multimodal DPO, retrieval-aware MoE architecture, and federated governance with adaptive CoT reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome three critical challenges in deploying LVLMs for clinical services: hallucination of answers not grounded in visual evidence, inefficiency of fixed-depth reasoning, and difficulty of multi-institutional collaboration.

Method: Proposes multimodal DPO for visual context alignment, retrieval-aware MoE architecture for routing queries to specialized experts, and federated governance with local meta-cognitive uncertainty estimator for adaptive CoT reasoning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three Med-VQA datasets, outperforming retrieval-augmented baselines by up to 11.85% in F1-score and reducing average reasoning length by 51.60% compared to fixed-depth CoT approaches.

Conclusion: MedAlign effectively addresses key deployment challenges for LVLMs in healthcare through its integrated approach of visual alignment, expert routing, and adaptive reasoning, demonstrating significant performance improvements and efficiency gains.

Abstract: Recently, large models have shown significant potential for smart healthcare.
However, the deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for clinical
services is currently hindered by three critical challenges: a tendency to
hallucinate answers not grounded in visual evidence, the inefficiency of
fixed-depth reasoning, and the difficulty of multi-institutional collaboration.
To address these challenges, in this paper, we develop MedAlign, a novel
framework to ensure visually accurate LVLM responses for Medical Visual
Question Answering (Med-VQA). Specifically, we first propose a multimodal
Direct Preference Optimization (mDPO) objective to explicitly align preference
learning with visual context. We then design a Retrieval-Aware
Mixture-of-Experts (RA-MoE) architecture that utilizes image and text
similarity to route queries to a specialized and context-augmented LVLM (i.e.,
an expert), thereby mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs. To achieve adaptive
reasoning and facilitate multi-institutional collaboration, we propose a
federated governance mechanism, where the selected expert, fine-tuned on
clinical datasets based on mDPO, locally performs iterative Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning via the local meta-cognitive uncertainty estimator. Extensive
experiments on three representative Med-VQA datasets demonstrate that MedAlign
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong retrieval-augmented
baselines by up to $11.85\%$ in F1-score, and simultaneously reducing the
average reasoning length by $51.60\%$ compared with fixed-depth CoT approaches.

TL;DR: A novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm robust to confounding biases in observed data, based on Deep Q-Network (DQN), that finds safe policies for worst-case environments compatible with observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address off-policy learning from biased data in complex domains where unobserved confounding cannot be ruled out, which affects decision-making based on past experiences.

Method: Building on DQN, the algorithm finds safe policies for worst-case environments compatible with observations, specifically designed to handle confounding biases.

Result: Applied to twelve confounded Atari games, the method consistently dominates standard DQN in all games where observed input to behavioral and target policies mismatch and unobserved confounders exist.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm effectively handles confounding biases in reinforcement learning and outperforms standard DQN in environments with unobserved confounders and policy input mismatches.

Abstract: A key task in Artificial Intelligence is learning effective policies for
controlling agents in unknown environments to optimize performance measures.
Off-policy learning methods, like Q-learning, allow learners to make optimal
decisions based on past experiences. This paper studies off-policy learning
from biased data in complex and high-dimensional domains where \emph{unobserved
confounding} cannot be ruled out a priori. Building on the well-celebrated Deep
Q-Network (DQN), we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm
robust to confounding biases in observed data. Specifically, our algorithm
attempts to find a safe policy for the worst-case environment compatible with
the observations. We apply our method to twelve confounded Atari games, and
find that it consistently dominates the standard DQN in all games where the
observed input to the behavioral and target policies mismatch and unobserved
confounders exist.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how agentic AI can function as autonomous decision-makers in decentralized governance systems and augment collective decision-making processes.

Method: Built an agentic AI voter using 3K+ proposals from major protocols, with modular composable program workflow that interprets proposal contexts, retrieves historical deliberation data, and determines voting positions within realistic financial simulation environment.

Result: Strong alignment between agent's decisions and human/token-weighted outcomes, demonstrating agentic AI can produce interpretable, auditable, and empirically grounded voting signals in DAO governance.

Conclusion: Agentic AI can effectively augment collective decision-making in decentralized financial systems, contributing to the design of explainable and economically rigorous AI agents.

Abstract: This paper presents a first empirical study of agentic AI as autonomous
decision-makers in decentralized governance. Using more than 3K proposals from
major protocols, we build an agentic AI voter that interprets proposal
contexts, retrieves historical deliberation data, and independently determines
its voting position. The agent operates within a realistic financial simulation
environment grounded in verifiable blockchain data, implemented through a
modular composable program (MCP) workflow that defines data flow and tool usage
via Agentics framework. We evaluate how closely the agent's decisions align
with the human and token-weighted outcomes, uncovering strong alignments
measured by carefully designed evaluation metrics. Our findings demonstrate
that agentic AI can augment collective decision-making by producing
interpretable, auditable, and empirically grounded signals in realistic DAO
governance settings. The study contributes to the design of explainable and
economically rigorous AI agents for decentralized financial systems.

*Jihyun Lee,Yejin Min,San Kim,Yejin Jeon,SungJun Yang,Hyounghun Kim,Gary Geunbae Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PACE dataset for panic attacks using first-person narratives and PFA principles, PACER counseling model trained with supervised learning and preference alignment, outperforms baselines in panic scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address scarcity of suitable datasets for training panic attack intervention models due to ethical and logistical issues.

Method: Introduce PACE dataset from first-person narratives structured around PFA principles, train PACER model using supervised learning and simulated preference alignment.

Result: PACER outperforms baselines in counselor-side metrics and client affect improvement, consistently preferred over general, CBT-based, and GPT-4-powered models in panic scenarios.

Conclusion: PACER demonstrates practical value for panic attack intervention through multi-dimensional evaluation framework PanicEval.

Abstract: Panic attacks are acute episodes of fear and distress, in which timely,
appropriate intervention can significantly help individuals regain stability.
However, suitable datasets for training such models remain scarce due to
ethical and logistical issues. To address this, we introduce PACE, which is a
dataset that includes high-distress episodes constructed from first-person
narratives, and structured around the principles of Psychological First Aid
(PFA). Using this data, we train PACER, a counseling model designed to provide
both empathetic and directive support, which is optimized through supervised
learning and simulated preference alignment. To assess its effectiveness, we
propose PanicEval, a multi-dimensional framework covering general counseling
quality and crisis-specific strategies. Experimental results show that PACER
outperforms strong baselines in both counselor-side metrics and client affect
improvement. Human evaluations further confirm its practical value, with PACER
consistently preferred over general, CBT-based, and GPT-4-powered models in
panic scenarios (Code is available at https://github.com/JihyunLee1/PanicToCalm

### [86] [NeuroGenPoisoning: Neuron-Guided Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation of LLM via Genetic Optimization of External Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21144)
*Hanyu Zhu,Lance Fiondella,Jiawei Yuan,Kai Zeng,Long Jiao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NeuroGenPoisoning is a novel attack framework that generates adversarial external knowledge in RAG systems by targeting LLM internal neurons and using genetic optimization, achieving over 90% success rate in overwriting model knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG poisoning attacks ignore model internal representation dynamics and neuron-level sensitivities, and don't address knowledge conflict with strong parametric knowledge in RAG systems.

Method: Identifies Poison-Responsive Neurons whose activation correlates with contextual poisoning knowledge, then uses genetic algorithm to evolve adversarial passages that maximally activate these neurons, enabling massive-scale generation of effective poisoned knowledge.

Result: Achieves consistently high Population Overwrite Success Rate (POSR) of over 90% across models and datasets while preserving fluency, and effectively resolves knowledge conflict.

Conclusion: The proposed NeuroGenPoisoning framework successfully demonstrates neuron-guided poisoning can effectively attack RAG systems and resolve knowledge conflicts through targeted neuron activation.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to
dynamically integrate external knowledge during inference, improving their
factual accuracy and adaptability. However, adversaries can inject poisoned
external knowledge to override the model's internal memory. While existing
attacks iteratively manipulate retrieval content or prompt structure of RAG,
they largely ignore the model's internal representation dynamics and
neuron-level sensitivities. The underlying mechanism of RAG poisoning has not
been fully studied and the effect of knowledge conflict with strong parametric
knowledge in RAG is not considered. In this work, we propose NeuroGenPoisoning,
a novel attack framework that generates adversarial external knowledge in RAG
guided by LLM internal neuron attribution and genetic optimization. Our method
first identifies a set of Poison-Responsive Neurons whose activation strongly
correlates with contextual poisoning knowledge. We then employ a genetic
algorithm to evolve adversarial passages that maximally activate these neurons.
Crucially, our framework enables massive-scale generation of effective poisoned
RAG knowledge by identifying and reusing promising but initially unsuccessful
external knowledge variants via observed attribution signals. At the same time,
Poison-Responsive Neurons guided poisoning can effectively resolves knowledge
conflict. Experimental results across models and datasets demonstrate
consistently achieving high Population Overwrite Success Rate (POSR) of over
90% while preserving fluency. Empirical evidence shows that our method
effectively resolves knowledge conflict.

### [87] [How to Auto-optimize Prompts for Domain Tasks? Adaptive Prompting and Reasoning through Evolutionary Domain Knowledge Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21148)
*Yang Zhao,Pu Wang,Hao Frank Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EGO-Prompt is an automated framework that optimizes prompts and reasoning processes for LLMs using evolutionary graph optimization and causal guidance, achieving significant performance improvements while reducing costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing optimal prompts and reasoning processes for LLMs on domain-specific tasks is challenging, especially regarding domain knowledge integration, reasoning efficiency, and providing refined knowledge integration hints.

Method: EGO-Prompt uses evolutionary graph optimization with initial Semantic Causal Graphs (SCGs) from experts, then refines them through causal-guided textual gradient processes and iterative optimization algorithms.

Result: Achieved 7.32%-12.61% higher F1 than state-of-the-art methods, enabled small models to match larger models' performance at under 20% cost, and produced refined domain-specific SCGs for better interpretability.

Conclusion: EGO-Prompt successfully automates prompt and reasoning process optimization, significantly improving LLM performance on domain tasks while reducing computational costs and enhancing interpretability.

Abstract: Designing optimal prompts and reasoning processes for large language models
(LLMs) on domain-specific tasks is both necessary and challenging in real-world
applications. Determining how to integrate domain knowledge, enhance reasoning
efficiency, and even provide domain experts with refined knowledge integration
hints are particularly crucial yet unresolved tasks. In this research, we
propose Evolutionary Graph Optimization for Prompting (EGO-Prompt), an
automated framework to designing better prompts, efficient reasoning processes
and providing enhanced causal-informed process. EGO-Prompt begins with a
general prompt and fault-tolerant initial Semantic Causal Graph (SCG)
descriptions, constructed by human experts, which is then automatically refined
and optimized to guide LLM reasoning. Recognizing that expert-defined SCGs may
be partial or imperfect and that their optimal integration varies across LLMs,
EGO-Prompt integrates a novel causal-guided textual gradient process in two
steps: first, generating nearly deterministic reasoning guidance from the SCG
for each instance, and second, adapting the LLM to effectively utilize the
guidance alongside the original input. The iterative optimization algorithm
further refines both the SCG and the reasoning mechanism using textual
gradients with ground-truth. We tested the framework on real-world public
health, transportation and human behavior tasks. EGO-Prompt achieves
7.32%-12.61% higher F1 than cutting-edge methods, and allows small models to
reach the performence of larger models at under 20% of the original cost. It
also outputs a refined, domain-specific SCG that improves interpretability.

### [88] [String Seed of Thought: Prompting LLMs for Distribution-Faithful and Diverse Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21150)
*Kou Misaki,Takuya Akiba*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SSoT is a prompting method that improves LLMs' ability to follow probabilistic instructions by having them generate random strings first to create entropy, then derive answers from those strings to maintain diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with Probabilistic Instruction Following (PIF) - selecting answers from predefined options with specific probabilities. This causes biases and reduces diversity in applications like human-behavior simulation, content diversification, and multiplayer games.

Method: SSoT prompts LLMs to first output a random string to generate entropy, then manipulate this string to derive the final answer while preserving diversity and adhering to constraints.

Result: SSoT significantly improves PIF performance, approaching the ideal performance of a pseudo-random number generator. It also enhances response diversity in open-ended tasks on NoveltyBench.

Conclusion: SSoT effectively addresses LLMs' limitations in probabilistic reasoning and diversity generation through simple prompting techniques that leverage random string generation.

Abstract: We introduce String Seed of Thought (SSoT), a novel prompting method for LLMs
that improves Probabilistic Instruction Following (PIF). We define PIF as a
task requiring an LLM to select its answer from a predefined set of options,
each associated with a specific probability, such that the empirical
distribution of the generated answers aligns with the target distribution when
prompted multiple times. While LLMs excel at tasks with single, deterministic
answers, they often fail at PIF, exhibiting biases problematic for applications
requiring non-deterministic behaviors, such as human-behavior simulation,
content diversification, and multiplayer games. It also harms the diversity of
generated responses, a crucial factor in test-time scaling, by causing the
outputs to collapse into a limited set of answers. To address this, we propose
SSoT, a simple prompting method that instructs an LLM to first output a random
string to generate sufficient entropy. SSoT also instructs the LLM to extract
randomness by manipulating this string to derive a final answer, thereby
preserving diversity while adhering to specific constraints. We demonstrate
that SSoT significantly improves the PIF performance of LLMs, approaching the
ideal performance of a pseudo-random number generator. Furthermore, our
experiments on NoveltyBench show SSoT's benefits extend beyond closed-set tasks
to open-ended tasks by enhancing response diversity.

*Yujin Jo,Taesup Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NuSA-CL is a memory-free continual learning framework for vision-language models that uses null space adaptation to preserve zero-shot capabilities while adapting to new tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static zero-shot VLMs struggle with distribution shifts and novel tasks in evolving environments, requiring continual learning without catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Employs low-rank adaptation and constrains weight updates to lie within an approximate null space of current parameters to minimize interference with previous knowledge.

Result: Effectively preserves zero-shot transfer capabilities and achieves competitive performance on continual learning benchmarks with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: NuSA-CL provides a practical and scalable solution for continually evolving zero-shot VLMs in real-world applications.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization, enabling deployment in a wide range of
real-world tasks without additional task-specific training. However, in real
deployment scenarios with evolving environments or emerging classes, these
models inevitably face distributional shifts and novel tasks. In such contexts,
static zero-shot capabilities are insufficient, and there is a growing need for
continual learning methods that allow models to adapt over time while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting. We introduce NuSA-CL (Null Space Adaptation for
Continual Learning), a lightweight memory-free continual learning framework
designed to address this challenge. NuSA-CL employs low-rank adaptation and
constrains task-specific weight updates to lie within an approximate null space
of the model's current parameters. This strategy minimizes interference with
previously acquired knowledge, effectively preserving the zero-shot
capabilities of the original model. Unlike methods relying on replay buffers or
costly distillation, NuSA-CL imposes minimal computational and memory overhead,
making it practical for deployment in resource-constrained, real-world
continual learning environments. Experiments show that our framework not only
effectively preserves zero-shot transfer capabilities but also achieves highly
competitive performance on continual learning benchmarks. These results
position NuSA-CL as a practical and scalable solution for continually evolving
zero-shot VLMs in real-world applications.

*Shuo Li,Keqin Xu,Jie Liu,Dan Ye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Shylock is a novel method for discovering causal relationships in multivariate time series (MTS) that works well in both few-shot and normal scenarios, addressing data scarcity issues and over-fitting problems of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing causal discovery methods are error-prone, rely on idealized assumptions, require huge datasets, and struggle with MTS data scarcity. Current approaches easily over-fit on MTS data, creating a need for more robust methods.

Method: Shylock uses group dilated convolution and sharing kernels to exponentially reduce parameters while learning better time-delayed variable representations. It combines global and local constraints for information sharing among networks to improve accuracy. The authors also developed a data generation method for MTS with time delay.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmarks and generated datasets show Shylock outperforms two state-of-the-art methods on both few-shot and normal MTS. The authors developed Tcausal library and deployed it on EarthDataMiner platform.

Conclusion: Shylock effectively addresses the challenges of causal discovery in MTS, particularly in data-scarce scenarios, through parameter-efficient architecture and constraint-based learning, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Causal relationship discovery has been drawing increasing attention due to
its prevalent application. Existing methods rely on human experience,
statistical methods, or graphical criteria methods which are error-prone, stuck
at the idealized assumption, and rely on a huge amount of data. And there is
also a serious data gap in accessing Multivariate time series(MTS) in many
areas, adding difficulty in finding their causal relationship. Existing methods
are easy to be over-fitting on them. To fill the gap we mentioned above, in
this paper, we propose Shylock, a novel method that can work well in both
few-shot and normal MTS to find the causal relationship. Shylock can reduce the
number of parameters exponentially by using group dilated convolution and a
sharing kernel, but still learn a better representation of variables with time
delay. By combing the global constraint and the local constraint, Shylock
achieves information sharing among networks to help improve the accuracy. To
evaluate the performance of Shylock, we also design a data generation method to
generate MTS with time delay. We evaluate it on commonly used benchmarks and
generated datasets. Extensive experiments show that Shylock outperforms two
existing state-of-art methods on both few-shot and normal MTS. We also
developed Tcausal, a library for easy use and deployed it on the EarthDataMiner
platform

Unlike existing methods that suffer from three key limitations - insufficient
dataset diversity and category coverage, unrealistic user simulation, and
inaccurate evaluation metrics - OutboundEval addresses these issues through a

process decomposition, weighted scoring, and domain-adaptive metrics. Second,
we develop a large-model-driven User Simulator that generates diverse,
persona-rich virtual users with realistic behaviors, emotional variability, and
communication styles, providing a controlled yet authentic testing environment.
Third, we introduce a dynamic evaluation method that adapts to task variations,
integrating automated and human-in-the-loop assessment to measure task

*Victoria J. Hodge,Colin Paterson,Ibrahim Habli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper provides a comprehensive review of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection techniques for safety assurance in autonomous systems, particularly in safety-critical domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The expansion of AI-enabled autonomous systems requires rigorous safety demonstration, which is challenging due to the need to handle novel and uncertain situations throughout the system lifecycle, including detecting OOD data.

Method: The authors conduct a comprehensive review that defines relevant concepts, investigates causes of OOD, explores safety assurance challenges, identifies OOD detection techniques for ML development lifecycle, and suggests their integration points for safety arguments.

Result: The review identifies a range of OOD detection techniques that can be used throughout the ML development lifecycle and provides guidance on their integration to support safety assurance arguments, while also highlighting important caveats for system engineers.

Conclusion: The paper outlines challenges and future work necessary for the safe development and operation of autonomous systems across various domains and applications.

Abstract: The operational capabilities and application domains of AI-enabled autonomous
systems have expanded significantly in recent years due to advances in robotics
and machine learning (ML). Demonstrating the safety of autonomous systems
rigorously is critical for their responsible adoption but it is challenging as
it requires robust methodologies that can handle novel and uncertain situations
throughout the system lifecycle, including detecting out-of-distribution (OoD)
data. Thus, OOD detection is receiving increased attention from the research,
development and safety engineering communities. This comprehensive review
analyses OOD detection techniques within the context of safety assurance for
autonomous systems, in particular in safety-critical domains. We begin by
defining the relevant concepts, investigating what causes OOD and exploring the
factors which make the safety assurance of autonomous systems and OOD detection
challenging. Our review identifies a range of techniques which can be used
throughout the ML development lifecycle and we suggest areas within the
lifecycle in which they may be used to support safety assurance arguments. We
discuss a number of caveats that system and safety engineers must be aware of
when integrating OOD detection into system lifecycles. We conclude by outlining
the challenges and future work necessary for the safe development and operation
of autonomous systems across a range of domains and applications.

### [93] [Investigating Scale Independent UCT Exploration Factor Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21275)
*Robin Schmöcker,Christoph Schnell,Alexander Dockhorn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes adaptive strategies for choosing the UCT exploration constant λ that are agnostic to the game's reward scale, recommending a new strategy using 2σ where σ is the empirical standard deviation of Q-values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UCT algorithm is sensitive to reward scales, which is problematic for games with dense rewards of varying magnitudes. Current approaches require hand-picked reward scales.

Method: Evaluated various λ-strategies (including five new ones) for adaptively choosing UCT exploration constant, focusing on methods that don't depend on reward scale.

Result: The new strategy using λ = 2σ (where σ is empirical standard deviation of Q-values) outperforms existing λ-strategies across various tasks.

Conclusion: Recommends using λ = 2σ strategy as it provides better performance than existing methods and works well with a single parameter value.

Abstract: The Upper Confidence Bounds For Trees (UCT) algorithm is not agnostic to the
reward scale of the game it is applied to. For zero-sum games with the sparse
rewards of $\{-1,0,1\}$ at the end of the game, this is not a problem, but many
games often feature dense rewards with hand-picked reward scales, causing a
node's Q-value to span different magnitudes across different games. In this
paper, we evaluate various strategies for adaptively choosing the UCT
exploration constant $\lambda$, called $\lambda$-strategies, that are agnostic
to the game's reward scale. These $\lambda$-strategies include those proposed
in the literature as well as five new strategies. Given our experimental
results, we recommend using one of our newly suggested $\lambda$-strategies,
which is to choose $\lambda$ as $2 \cdot \sigma$ where $\sigma$ is the
empirical standard deviation of all state-action pairs' Q-values of the search
tree. This method outperforms existing $\lambda$-strategies across a wide range
of tasks both in terms of a single parameter value and the peak performances
obtained by optimizing all available parameters.

### [94] [When Models Outthink Their Safety: Mitigating Self-Jailbreak in Large Reasoning Models with Chain-of-Guardrails](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21285)
*Yingzhi Mao,Chunkang Zhang,Junxiang Wang,Xinyan Guan,Boxi Cao,Yaojie Lu,Hongyu Lin,Xianpei Han,Le Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG), a training framework that improves safety in Large Reasoning Models by recomposing unsafe reasoning steps while preserving reasoning ability, addressing the safety-reasoning trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities but are vulnerable to safety risks like harmful content generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing mitigation strategies suppress reasoning ability and fail to resolve the safety-reasoning trade-off.

Method: The authors analyze reasoning trajectories and discover Self-Jailbreak phenomenon, then propose Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG) framework that recomposes or backtracks unsafe reasoning steps to steer models back to safe trajectories while preserving valid reasoning chains.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning and safety benchmarks show CoG substantially improves safety of current LRMs while preserving comparable reasoning ability, significantly outperforming prior methods that suffer from severe safety-reasoning trade-offs.

Conclusion: CoG effectively addresses the safety-reasoning trade-off in Large Reasoning Models by leveraging the models' inherent ability to reject unsafe queries through systematic intervention in unsafe reasoning trajectories.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on complex
reasoning tasks but remain vulnerable to severe safety risks, including harmful
content generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing mitigation strategies rely
on injecting heuristic safety signals during training, which often suppress
reasoning ability and fail to resolve the safety-reasoning trade-off. To
systematically investigate this issue, we analyze the reasoning trajectories of
diverse LRMs and uncover a phenomenon we term Self-Jailbreak, where models
override their own risk assessments and justify responding to unsafe prompts.
This finding reveals that LRMs inherently possess the ability to reject unsafe
queries, but this ability is compromised, resulting in harmful outputs.
Building on these insights, we propose the Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG), a training
framework that recomposes or backtracks unsafe reasoning steps, steering the
model back onto safe trajectories while preserving valid reasoning chains.
Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning and safety benchmarks
demonstrate that CoG substantially improves the safety of current LRMs while
preserving comparable reasoning ability, significantly outperforming prior
methods that suffer from severe safety-reasoning trade-offs.

*Siddharth Mehrotra,Jin Huang,Xuelong Fu,Roel Dobbe,Clara I. Sánchez,Maarten de Rijke*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This scoping review examines how AI ethics conferences (AIES and FAccT) conceptualize and measure AI trustworthiness, finding current approaches are overly technocentric and neglect sociotechnical dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI trustworthiness research focuses primarily on technical attributes while overlooking critical sociotechnical dimensions needed for real-world AI systems.

Method: Scoping review of AIES and FAccT conference proceedings, analyzing how trustworthiness is defined, operationalized, and applied across research domains.

Result: Significant gaps found - research emphasizes technical precision over social/ethical considerations, trustworthiness emerges as contested concept shaped by power dynamics.

Conclusion: Interdisciplinary approach combining technical rigor with social/cultural/institutional considerations is essential for advancing trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: Background: Trustworthy AI serves as a foundational pillar for two major AI
ethics conferences: AIES and FAccT. However, current research often adopts
techno-centric approaches, focusing primarily on technical attributes such as
reliability, robustness, and fairness, while overlooking the sociotechnical
dimensions critical to understanding AI trustworthiness in real-world contexts.
  Objectives: This scoping review aims to examine how the AIES and FAccT
communities conceptualize, measure, and validate AI trustworthiness,
identifying major gaps and opportunities for advancing a holistic understanding
of trustworthy AI systems.
  Methods: We conduct a scoping review of AIES and FAccT conference proceedings
to date, systematically analyzing how trustworthiness is defined,
operationalized, and applied across different research domains. Our analysis
focuses on conceptualization approaches, measurement methods, verification and
validation techniques, application areas, and underlying values.
  Results: While significant progress has been made in defining technical
attributes such as transparency, accountability, and robustness, our findings
reveal critical gaps. Current research often predominantly emphasizes technical
precision at the expense of social and ethical considerations. The
sociotechnical nature of AI systems remains less explored and trustworthiness
emerges as a contested concept shaped by those with the power to define it.
  Conclusions: An interdisciplinary approach combining technical rigor with
social, cultural, and institutional considerations is essential for advancing
trustworthy AI. We propose actionable measures for the AI ethics community to
adopt holistic frameworks that genuinely address the complex interplay between
AI systems and society, ultimately promoting responsible technological
development that benefits all stakeholders.

### [96] [Towards Reliable Code-as-Policies: A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Embodied Task Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21302)
*Sanghyun Ahn,Wonje Choi,Junyong Lee,Jinwoo Park,Honguk Woo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A neuro-symbolic framework that combines LLM code generation with symbolic verification and interactive validation to improve embodied task planning in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based code-as-policies approaches suffer from limited environmental grounding in dynamic or partially observable settings, leading to suboptimal task success rates.

Method: Incorporates explicit symbolic verification and interactive validation processes during code generation, including exploratory code that actively interacts with the environment to acquire missing observations while preserving task-relevant states.

Result: Improves task success rates by 46.2% over Code-as-Policies baselines and attains over 86.8% executability of task-relevant actions in RLBench and real-world dynamic scenarios.

Conclusion: The integrated neuro-symbolic framework enhances grounding of generated code, resulting in improved task reliability and success rates in complex environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the automatic
generation of executable code for task planning and control in embodied agents
such as robots, demonstrating the potential of LLM-based embodied intelligence.
However, these LLM-based code-as-policies approaches often suffer from limited
environmental grounding, particularly in dynamic or partially observable
settings, leading to suboptimal task success rates due to incorrect or
incomplete code generation. In this work, we propose a neuro-symbolic embodied
task planning framework that incorporates explicit symbolic verification and
interactive validation processes during code generation. In the validation
phase, the framework generates exploratory code that actively interacts with
the environment to acquire missing observations while preserving task-relevant
states. This integrated process enhances the grounding of generated code,
resulting in improved task reliability and success rates in complex
environments. We evaluate our framework on RLBench and in real-world settings
across dynamic, partially observable scenarios. Experimental results
demonstrate that our framework improves task success rates by 46.2% over
Code-as-Policies baselines and attains over 86.8% executability of
task-relevant actions, thereby enhancing the reliability of task planning in
dynamic environments.

### [97] [CXRAgent: Director-Orchestrated Multi-Stage Reasoning for Chest X-Ray Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21324)
*Jinhui Lou,Yan Yang,Zhou Yu,Zhenqi Fu,Weidong Han,Qingming Huang,Jun Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CXRAgent is a director-orchestrated multi-stage agent for chest X-ray interpretation that coordinates tool usage with reliability validation, adaptive diagnostic planning, and collaborative expert reasoning to improve adaptability and credibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CXR analysis models struggle with adapting to new diagnostic tasks and complex reasoning scenarios, and current LLM-based agents lack mechanisms for assessing tool reliability and use single diagnostic pipelines.

Method: A three-stage approach: (1) Tool Invocation with Evidence-driven Validator for output verification and visual evidence grounding, (2) Diagnostic Planning that adaptively assembles expert teams based on task requirements, and (3) Collaborative Decision-making integrating expert insights with contextual memories.

Result: Experiments show CXRAgent delivers strong performance across various CXR interpretation tasks, provides visual evidence, and generalizes well to clinical tasks of different complexity.

Conclusion: CXRAgent represents an effective multi-stage agent framework that enhances CXR interpretation through reliable tool coordination, adaptive planning, and collaborative reasoning, addressing limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) plays a pivotal role in clinical diagnosis, and a variety
of task-specific and foundation models have been developed for automatic CXR
interpretation. However, these models often struggle to adapt to new diagnostic
tasks and complex reasoning scenarios. Recently, LLM-based agent models have
emerged as a promising paradigm for CXR analysis, enhancing model's capability
through tool coordination, multi-step reasoning, and team collaboration, etc.
However, existing agents often rely on a single diagnostic pipeline and lack
mechanisms for assessing tools' reliability, limiting their adaptability and
credibility. To this end, we propose CXRAgent, a director-orchestrated,
multi-stage agent for CXR interpretation, where a central director coordinates
the following stages: (1) Tool Invocation: The agent strategically orchestrates
a set of CXR-analysis tools, with outputs normalized and verified by the
Evidence-driven Validator (EDV), which grounds diagnostic outputs with visual
evidence to support reliable downstream diagnosis; (2) Diagnostic Planning:
Guided by task requirements and intermediate findings, the agent formulates a
targeted diagnostic plan. It then assembles an expert team accordingly,
defining member roles and coordinating their interactions to enable adaptive
and collaborative reasoning; (3) Collaborative Decision-making: The agent
integrates insights from the expert team with accumulated contextual memories,
synthesizing them into an evidence-backed diagnostic conclusion. Experiments on
various CXR interpretation tasks show that CXRAgent delivers strong
performance, providing visual evidence and generalizes well to clinical tasks
of different complexity. Code and data are valuable at this

*Lufan Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Magellan is a framework that uses Monte Carlo Tree Search with hierarchical guidance to help LLMs generate more innovative ideas by steering exploration away from familiar concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with true innovation, defaulting to familiar concepts from training data. Existing methods like Tree of Thoughts rely on flawed self-evaluation heuristics that limit creative exploration.

Method: Uses Monte Carlo Tree Search with hierarchical guidance: a "semantic compass" for long-range direction via orthogonal projection, and a landscape-aware value function for local decisions that balances coherence, novelty, and narrative progress.

Result: Significantly outperforms strong baselines (ReAct and ToT) in generating scientific ideas with superior plausibility and innovation.

Conclusion: Principled, guided search is more effective than unconstrained agency for creative discovery, enabling LLMs to become better innovation partners.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with generating truly innovative
ideas, typically defaulting to high-probability, familiar concepts within their
training data's "gravity wells." While advanced search-based methods like Tree
of Thoughts (ToT) attempt to mitigate this, they are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on unprincipled, inconsistent self-evaluation heuristics to
guide exploration. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{Magellan}, a novel
framework that reframes creative generation as a principled, guided exploration
of an LLM's latent conceptual space. At its core, Magellan employs Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) governed by a hierarchical guidance system. For long-range
direction, a "semantic compass" vector, formulated via orthogonal projection,
steers the search towards relevant novelty. For local, step-by-step decisions,
a landscape-aware value function replaces flawed self-evaluation with an
explicit reward structure that balances intrinsic coherence, extrinsic novelty,
and narrative progress. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Magellan
significantly outperforms strong baselines, including ReAct and ToT, in
generating scientific ideas with superior plausibility and innovation. Our work
shows that for creative discovery, a principled, guided search is more
effective than unconstrained agency, paving the way for LLMs to become more
capable partners in innovation.

*Ravindra Aribowo Tarunokusumo,Rafael Fernandes Cunha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework combining reinforcement learning with supervised fine-tuning improves mathematical reasoning in small language models by reducing token usage by over 40% while increasing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Budget forcing methods for improving reasoning performance rely on supervised fine-tuning with long-context reasoning traces, which causes performance degradation in smaller models due to verbose responses.

Method: Integration of reinforcement learning with supervised fine-tuning to improve token efficiency and boost performance of a 1.5B model for mathematical reasoning, using only 1.5K training samples.

Result: The SFT+RL model performed better on GSM8K dataset with varying compute budgets, achieving higher accuracy while reducing token usage by over 40% compared to SFT-only model.

Conclusion: RL can recover losses from long-context training and improve mathematical reasoning performance in small language models by making them more token-efficient.

Abstract: Test-time scaling methods have seen a rapid increase in popularity for its
computational efficiency and parameter-independent training to improve
reasoning performance on Large Language Models. One such method is called
budget forcing, a decoding intervention strategy which allocates extra compute
budget for thinking and elicits the inherent self-correcting behavior of the
model. However, this relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long-context
reasoning traces which causes performance degradation on smaller models due to
verbose responses. For this reason, we offer a framework integrating
reinforcement learning (RL) to improve token efficiency and boost the
performance of a 1.5B model for mathematical reasoning. We demonstrate this
using only 1.5K training samples and found that our SFT+RL model performed
better on the GSM8K dataset with varying compute budgets. Our main findings
showed an overall higher accuracy while significantly reducing its token usage
by over 40% compared to the SFT model, revealing how RL can recover the losses
due to long-context training and altogether improving performance in
mathematical reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper reviews Neurosymbolic AI methods for LLMs, proposes a taxonomy and roadmap for symbolic integration to enhance transparency, and identifies current benchmarks and research gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack transparency as black boxes, and existing Neurosymbolic AI approaches designed for conventional neural networks are not well-suited for LLMs' unique features, creating a gap in systematic understanding of symbolic AI integration.

Method: The paper reviews established NeSy AI methods, proposes a novel taxonomy of symbolic integration in LLMs across four dimensions (integration stages, coupling mechanisms, architectural paradigms, and algorithmic/application perspectives), and organizes existing literature within these categories.

Result: The paper develops a comprehensive roadmap for merging symbolic techniques with LLMs, identifies current benchmarks and cutting-edge advancements, and highlights critical gaps in the field.

Conclusion: By providing a systematic framework and practical insights, this research offers guidance for future development of transparent LLMs through effective symbolic integration, addressing the transparency challenges in current black-box LLM systems.

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated highly effective learning, human-like response
generation,and decision-making capabilities in high-risk sectors. However,
these models remain black boxes because they struggle to ensure transparency in
responses. The literature has explored numerous approaches to address
transparency challenges in LLMs, including Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy AI). NeSy AI
approaches were primarily developed for conventional neural networks and are
not well-suited to the unique features of LLMs. Consequently, there is a
limited systematic understanding of how symbolic AI can be effectively
integrated into LLMs. This paper aims to address this gap by first reviewing
established NeSy AI methods and then proposing a novel taxonomy of symbolic
integration in LLMs, along with a roadmap to merge symbolic techniques with
LLMs. The roadmap introduces a new categorisation framework across four
dimensions by organising existing literature within these categories. These
include symbolic integration across various stages of LLM, coupling mechanisms,
architectural paradigms, as well as algorithmic and application-level
perspectives. The paper thoroughly identifies current benchmarks, cutting-edge
advancements, and critical gaps within the field to propose a roadmap for
future research. By highlighting the latest developments and notable gaps in
the literature, it offers practical insights for implementing frameworks for
symbolic integration into LLMs to enhance transparency.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoOpt-11k is a dataset of 11,000+ handwritten/printed optimization models with LaTeX and modeling language labels. The AutoOpt framework uses ML to automatically solve optimization problems from images through three modules: image-to-LaTeX conversion, LaTeX-to-PYOMO generation, and optimization solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate the process of solving mathematical optimization problems by eliminating manual intervention and enabling users to simply provide images of formulations.

Method: Three-module framework: M1 uses deep learning for mathematical expression recognition from images to LaTeX, M2 uses fine-tuned LLM to convert LaTeX to PYOMO scripts, M3 uses Bilevel Optimization based Decomposition to solve the optimization problems.

Result: The MER model outperforms ChatGPT, Gemini and Nougat on BLEU score. The BOBD method yields better results on complex problems compared to interior-point and genetic algorithms.

Conclusion: AutoOpt provides an effective automated approach for solving optimization problems from images, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods on complex test cases.

Abstract: This study presents AutoOpt-11k, a unique image dataset of over 11,000
handwritten and printed mathematical optimization models corresponding to
single-objective, multi-objective, multi-level, and stochastic optimization
problems exhibiting various types of complexities such as non-linearity,
non-convexity, non-differentiability, discontinuity, and high-dimensionality.
The labels consist of the LaTeX representation for all the images and modeling
language representation for a subset of images. The dataset is created by 25
experts following ethical data creation guidelines and verified in two-phases
to avoid errors. Further, we develop AutoOpt framework, a machine learning
based automated approach for solving optimization problems, where the user just
needs to provide an image of the formulation and AutoOpt solves it efficiently
without any further human intervention. AutoOpt framework consists of three
Modules: (i) M1 (Image_to_Text)- a deep learning model performs the
Mathematical Expression Recognition (MER) task to generate the LaTeX code
corresponding to the optimization formulation in image; (ii) M2 (Text_to_Text)-
a small-scale fine-tuned LLM generates the PYOMO script (optimization modeling
language) from LaTeX code; (iii) M3 (Optimization)- a Bilevel Optimization
based Decomposition (BOBD) method solves the optimization formulation described
in the PYOMO script. We use AutoOpt-11k dataset for training and testing of
deep learning models employed in AutoOpt. The deep learning model for MER task
(M1) outperforms ChatGPT, Gemini and Nougat on BLEU score metric. BOBD method
(M3), which is a hybrid approach, yields better results on complex test
problems compared to common approaches, like interior-point algorithm and
genetic algorithm.

### [102] [Multi-Task Vehicle Routing Solver via Mixture of Specialized Experts under State-Decomposable MDP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21453)
*Yuxin Pan,Zhiguang Cao,Chengyang Gu,Liu Liu,Peilin Zhao,Yize Chen,Fangzhen Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework that enables unified neural solvers for multi-task vehicle routing problems to reuse specialized basis solvers through state decomposition and latent space mixture, achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unified neural solvers for multi-task VRPs underutilize the compositional structure of VRP variants and miss benefits from specialized basis solvers for fundamental VRP types.

Method: Proposed State-Decomposable MDP (SDMDP) that decomposes VRP states into basis state spaces, and Latent Space-based SDMDP with optimal basis policies and learnable mixture function. Implemented as Mixture-of-Specialized-Experts Solver (MoSES) using LoRA experts and adaptive gating.

Result: Extensive experiments show MoSES achieves superior performance across VRP variants compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables unified solvers to perceive shared components across VRP variants through basis solver reuse, overcoming limitations of traditional unified approaches while avoiding exponential growth of trained solvers.

Abstract: Existing neural methods for multi-task vehicle routing problems (VRPs)
typically learn unified solvers to handle multiple constraints simultaneously.
However, they often underutilize the compositional structure of VRP variants,
each derivable from a common set of basis VRP variants. This critical oversight
causes unified solvers to miss out the potential benefits of basis solvers,
each specialized for a basis VRP variant. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a framework that enables unified solvers to perceive the
shared-component nature across VRP variants by proactively reusing basis
solvers, while mitigating the exponential growth of trained neural solvers.
Specifically, we introduce a State-Decomposable MDP (SDMDP) that reformulates
VRPs by expressing the state space as the Cartesian product of basis state
spaces associated with basis VRP variants. More crucially, this formulation
inherently yields the optimal basis policy for each basis VRP variant.
Furthermore, a Latent Space-based SDMDP extension is developed by incorporating
both the optimal basis policies and a learnable mixture function to enable the
policy reuse in the latent space. Under mild assumptions, this extension
provably recovers the optimal unified policy of SDMDP through the mixture
function that computes the state embedding as a mapping from the basis state
embeddings generated by optimal basis policies. For practical implementation,
we introduce the Mixture-of-Specialized-Experts Solver (MoSES), which realizes
basis policies through specialized Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) experts, and
implements the mixture function via an adaptive gating mechanism. Extensive
experiments conducted across VRP variants showcase the superiority of MoSES
over prior methods.

*Ilija Lichkovski,Alexander Müller,Mariam Ibrahim,Tiwai Mhundwa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EU-Agent-Bench is a human-curated benchmark that evaluates LLM agents' compliance with EU legal norms when benign user inputs could lead to unlawful actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents deployed with tools can exhibit unpredictable and unsafe behaviors, including taking illegal actions under EU legislative context.

Method: Created a verifiable benchmark with scenarios across data protection, bias/discrimination, and scientific integrity categories, comparing model function calls against rubrics supported by legislative citations.

Result: Evaluated frontier LLMs' legal compliance and investigated the effect of providing legislative excerpts in system prompts with explicit compliance instructions.

Conclusion: Encourages extending agentic safety benchmarks to different legal jurisdictions and multi-turn, multilingual interactions, with code released publicly.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in various
contexts by providing tools at their disposal. However, LLM agents can exhibit
unpredictable behaviors, including taking undesirable and/or unsafe actions. In
order to measure the latent propensity of LLM agents for taking illegal actions
under an EU legislative context, we introduce EU-Agent-Bench, a verifiable
human-curated benchmark that evaluates an agent's alignment with EU legal norms
in situations where benign user inputs could lead to unlawful actions. Our
benchmark spans scenarios across several categories, including data protection,
bias/discrimination, and scientific integrity, with each user request allowing
for both compliant and non-compliant execution of the requested actions.
Comparing the model's function calls against a rubric exhaustively supported by
citations of the relevant legislature, we evaluate the legal compliance of
frontier LLMs, and furthermore investigate the compliance effect of providing
the relevant legislative excerpts in the agent's system prompt along with
explicit instructions to comply. We release a public preview set for the
research community, while holding out a private test set to prevent data
contamination in evaluating upcoming models. We encourage future work extending
agentic safety benchmarks to different legal jurisdictions and to multi-turn
and multilingual interactions. We release our code on

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Co-Sight improves long-horizon reasoning in LLM agents through conflict-aware verification and structured fact management, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents often fails due to insufficient verification of intermediate reasoning rather than generative weakness.

Method: Uses two mechanisms: Conflict-Aware Meta-Verification (CAMV) for targeted falsification of disagreement hotspots, and Trustworthy Reasoning with Structured Facts (TRSF) for organizing and validating evidence across agents.

Result: Achieves 84.4% accuracy on GAIA, 35.5% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 93.8% on Chinese-SimpleQA, with ablation studies confirming the synergy between structured grounding and conflict-aware verification.

Conclusion: Co-Sight offers a scalable paradigm for reliable long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents through a closed verification loop between structured factual grounding and conflict-aware verification.

Abstract: Long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents often fails not from generative
weakness but from insufficient verification of intermediate reasoning. Co-Sight
addresses this challenge by turning reasoning into a falsifiable and auditable
process through two complementary mechanisms: Conflict-Aware Meta-Verification
(CAMV) and Trustworthy Reasoning with Structured Facts (TRSF). CAMV
reformulates verification as conflict identification and targeted
falsification, allocating computation only to disagreement hotspots among
expert agents rather than to full reasoning chains. This bounds verification
cost to the number of inconsistencies and improves efficiency and reliability.
TRSF continuously organizes, validates, and synchronizes evidence across agents
through a structured facts module. By maintaining verified, traceable, and
auditable knowledge, it ensures that all reasoning is grounded in consistent,
source-verified information and supports transparent verification throughout
the reasoning process. Together, TRSF and CAMV form a closed verification loop,
where TRSF supplies structured facts and CAMV selectively falsifies or
reinforces them, yielding transparent and trustworthy reasoning. Empirically,
Co-Sight achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on GAIA (84.4%) and Humanity's Last
Exam (35.5%), and strong results on Chinese-SimpleQA (93.8%). Ablation studies
confirm that the synergy between structured factual grounding and
conflict-aware verification drives these improvements. Co-Sight thus offers a
scalable paradigm for reliable long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents. Code

### [105] [Learning Neural Control Barrier Functions from Expert Demonstrations using Inverse Constraint Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21560)
*Yuxuan Yang,Hussein Sibai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Learning neural control barrier functions from expert demonstrations using ICL to handle unspecified failure sets, achieving comparable performance to ground-truth labeled approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety is critical for autonomous systems, but failure sets are often non-obvious or hard to specify formally, while expert demonstrations are easier to generate.

Method: Use ICL to train a constraint function that classifies states as safe/unsafe, then use this to label simulated trajectories for training neural CBFs.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines and achieves comparable performance to neural CBFs trained with ground-truth safety labels across four environments.

Conclusion: The approach effectively learns safety constraints from demonstrations when failure sets are unspecified, providing a practical alternative to formal specification.

Abstract: Safety is a fundamental requirement for autonomous systems operating in
critical domains. Control barrier functions (CBFs) have been used to design
safety filters that minimally alter nominal controls for such systems to
maintain their safety. Learning neural CBFs has been proposed as a data-driven
alternative for their computationally expensive optimization-based synthesis.
However, it is often the case that the failure set of states that should be
avoided is non-obvious or hard to specify formally, e.g., tailgating in
autonomous driving, while a set of expert demonstrations that achieve the task
and avoid the failure set is easier to generate. We use ICL to train a
constraint function that classifies the states of the system under
consideration to safe, i.e., belong to a controlled forward invariant set that
is disjoint from the unspecified failure set, and unsafe ones, i.e., belong to
the complement of that set. We then use that function to label a new set of
simulated trajectories to train our neural CBF. We empirically evaluate our
approach in four different environments, demonstrating that it outperforms
existing baselines and achieves comparable performance to a neural CBF trained
with the same data but annotated with ground-truth safety labels.

### [106] [Huxley-Gödel Machine: Human-Level Coding Agent Development by an Approximation of the Optimal Self-Improving Machine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21614)
*Wenyi Wang,Piotr Piękos,Li Nanbo,Firas Laakom,Yimeng Chen,Mateusz Ostaszewski,Mingchen Zhuge,Jürgen Schmidhuber*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Huxley-Gödel Machine (HGM), a self-improving coding agent that uses a new metric called CMP to measure an agent's self-improvement potential, outperforming previous methods on coding benchmarks while using less time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-improving coding agents focus on benchmark performance, but there's a mismatch between this performance and actual self-improvement potential (metaproductivity). The authors aim to better measure and leverage an agent's true capacity for self-modification.

Method: Proposed the CMP metric that aggregates descendant benchmark performances to estimate self-improvement potential. Developed HGM which estimates CMP and uses it to guide the search through the tree of self-modifications, simulating Gödel Machine behavior.

Result: HGM outperforms prior self-improving coding agent methods on SWE-bench Verified and Polyglot while using less wall-clock time. It shows strong transfer to other coding datasets and LLMs, achieving human-level performance on SWE-bench Lite.

Conclusion: The CMP metric effectively captures self-improvement potential, and HGM demonstrates that estimating and using this metric can lead to more efficient and effective self-improving coding agents that match human-engineered performance.

Abstract: Recent studies operationalize self-improvement through coding agents that
edit their own codebases. They grow a tree of self-modifications through
expansion strategies that favor higher software engineering benchmark
performance, assuming that this implies more promising subsequent
self-modifications. However, we identify a mismatch between the agent's
self-improvement potential (metaproductivity) and its coding benchmark
performance, namely the Metaproductivity-Performance Mismatch. Inspired by
Huxley's concept of clade, we propose a metric ($\mathrm{CMP}$) that aggregates
the benchmark performances of the descendants of an agent as an indicator of
its potential for self-improvement. We show that, in our self-improving coding
agent development setting, access to the true $\mathrm{CMP}$ is sufficient to
simulate how the G\"odel Machine would behave under certain assumptions. We
introduce the Huxley-G\"odel Machine (HGM), which, by estimating $\mathrm{CMP}$
and using it as guidance, searches the tree of self-modifications. On SWE-bench
Verified and Polyglot, HGM outperforms prior self-improving coding agent
development methods while using less wall-clock time. Last but not least, HGM
demonstrates strong transfer to other coding datasets and large language
models. The agent optimized by HGM on SWE-bench Verified with GPT-5-mini and
evaluated on SWE-bench Lite with GPT-5 achieves human-level performance,
matching the best officially checked results of human-engineered coding agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepAgent is an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous thinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single reasoning process, featuring memory folding and ToolPO reinforcement learning for efficient tool use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agent frameworks follow predefined workflows that limit autonomous and global task completion, while real-world tasks require external tools and long-horizon interactions.

Method: Introduces autonomous memory folding to compress past interactions into structured memories (episodic, working, tool) and ToolPO reinforcement learning that leverages LLM-simulated APIs with tool-call advantage attribution.

Result: Outperforms baselines across eight benchmarks including general tool-use tasks (ToolBench, API-Bank, TMDB, Spotify, ToolHop) and downstream applications (ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA, HLE) in both labeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios.

Conclusion: This work takes a step toward more general and capable agents for real-world applications by enabling autonomous thinking and efficient tool use through memory management and reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Large reasoning models have demonstrated strong problem-solving abilities,
yet real-world tasks often require external tools and long-horizon
interactions. Existing agent frameworks typically follow predefined workflows,
which limit autonomous and global task completion. In this paper, we introduce
DeepAgent, an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous
thinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single, coherent
reasoning process. To address the challenges of long-horizon interactions,
particularly the context length explosion from multiple tool calls and the
accumulation of interaction history, we introduce an autonomous memory folding
mechanism that compresses past interactions into structured episodic, working,
and tool memories, reducing error accumulation while preserving critical
information. To teach general-purpose tool use efficiently and stably, we
develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, namely ToolPO, that
leverages LLM-simulated APIs and applies tool-call advantage attribution to
assign fine-grained credit to the tool invocation tokens. Extensive experiments
on eight benchmarks, including general tool-use tasks (ToolBench, API-Bank,
TMDB, Spotify, ToolHop) and downstream applications (ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA,
HLE), demonstrate that DeepAgent consistently outperforms baselines across both
labeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios. This work takes a step
toward more general and capable agents for real-world applications. The code

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AstaBench is a comprehensive benchmarking suite for evaluating AI agents in scientific research, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks by providing holistic measures, reproducible tools, controlled evaluation, and comprehensive baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI agent benchmarks fail to adequately evaluate scientific research capabilities due to lack of holistic measures, reproducible tools, controlled comparisons, and comprehensive baselines, hindering progress in developing effective science AI assistants.

Method: Developed AstaBench with 2400+ problems spanning the entire scientific discovery process across multiple domains, including a scientific research environment with production-grade search tools for reproducible evaluation, plus nine science-optimized agent classes and numerous baselines.

Result: Evaluation of 57 agents across 22 classes revealed that despite progress on individual aspects, AI remains far from solving the challenge of comprehensive science research assistance.

Conclusion: AstaBench provides the first holistic framework for rigorous evaluation of AI agents in scientific research, highlighting that current AI capabilities still fall short of fully assisting scientific discovery despite meaningful progress in specific areas.

Abstract: AI agents hold the potential to revolutionize scientific productivity by
automating literature reviews, replicating experiments, analyzing data, and
even proposing new directions of inquiry; indeed, there are now many such
agents, ranging from general-purpose "deep research" systems to specialized
science-specific agents, such as AI Scientist and AIGS. Rigorous evaluation of
these agents is critical for progress. Yet existing benchmarks fall short on
several fronts: they (1) fail to provide holistic, product-informed measures of
real-world use cases such as science research; (2) lack reproducible agent
tools necessary for a controlled comparison of core agentic capabilities; (3)
do not account for confounding variables such as model cost and tool access;
(4) do not provide standardized interfaces for quick agent prototyping and
evaluation; and (5) lack comprehensive baseline agents necessary to identify
true advances. In response, we define principles and tooling for more
rigorously benchmarking agents. Using these, we present AstaBench, a suite that
provides the first holistic measure of agentic ability to perform scientific
research, comprising 2400+ problems spanning the entire scientific discovery
process and multiple scientific domains, and including many problems inspired
by actual user requests to deployed Asta agents. Our suite comes with the first
scientific research environment with production-grade search tools that enable
controlled, reproducible evaluation, better accounting for confounders.
Alongside, we provide a comprehensive suite of nine science-optimized classes
of Asta agents and numerous baselines. Our extensive evaluation of 57 agents
across 22 agent classes reveals several interesting findings, most importantly
that despite meaningful progress on certain individual aspects, AI remains far
from solving the challenge of science research assistance.

### [109] [CMOMgen: Complex Multi-Ontology Alignment via Pattern-Guided In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21656)
*Marta Contreiras Silva,Daniel Faria,Catia Pesquita*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CMOMgen is the first end-to-end complex multi-ontology matching strategy that generates complete and semantically sound mappings without restrictions on target ontologies or entities, using Retrieval-Augmented Generation and In-Context Learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simple pairwise ontology matching cannot provide full semantic integration of related but disjoint ontologies. Complex multi-ontology matching is needed to align source entities to composite logical expressions of multiple target entities for more nuanced equivalences and provenance.

Method: Uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation to select relevant classes and filter matching reference mappings as examples for In-Context Learning. CMOMgen generates complete mappings without restrictions on number of target ontologies or entities.

Result: Outperforms baselines in class selection, achieves minimum 63% F1-score, outperforms all baselines and ablated versions in 2 out of 3 biomedical tasks, and places second in the third. Manual evaluation shows 46% of non-reference mappings achieve maximum score.

Conclusion: CMOMgen demonstrates effective complex multi-ontology matching with semantically sound mappings, showing the importance of dedicated strategies for comprehensive knowledge graph construction.

Abstract: Constructing comprehensive knowledge graphs requires the use of multiple
ontologies in order to fully contextualize data into a domain. Ontology
matching finds equivalences between concepts interconnecting ontologies and
creating a cohesive semantic layer. While the simple pairwise state of the art
is well established, simple equivalence mappings cannot provide full semantic
integration of related but disjoint ontologies. Complex multi-ontology matching
(CMOM) aligns one source entity to composite logical expressions of multiple
target entities, establishing more nuanced equivalences and provenance along
the ontological hierarchy.
  We present CMOMgen, the first end-to-end CMOM strategy that generates
complete and semantically sound mappings, without establishing any restrictions
on the number of target ontologies or entities. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
selects relevant classes to compose the mapping and filters matching reference
mappings to serve as examples, enhancing In-Context Learning. The strategy was
evaluated in three biomedical tasks with partial reference alignments. CMOMgen
outperforms baselines in class selection, demonstrating the impact of having a
dedicated strategy. Our strategy also achieves a minimum of 63% in F1-score,
outperforming all baselines and ablated versions in two out of three tasks and
placing second in the third. Furthermore, a manual evaluation of non-reference
mappings showed that 46% of the mappings achieve the maximum score, further
substantiating its ability to construct semantically sound mappings.

*Gaku Morio,Harri Rowlands,Dominik Stammbach,Christopher D. Manning,Peter Henderson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A benchmark dataset for analyzing corporate framing in video ads, especially focused on detecting greenwashing in energy sector communications using vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand corporate public relations campaigns at scale, particularly the mismatch between what companies say and do (like greenwashing), by analyzing framing in video advertisements.

Method: Created an expert-annotated dataset of video ads from Facebook and YouTube with 13 framing types across 50+ companies in 20 countries, specifically designed for vision-language model evaluation.

Result: Baseline experiments show GPT-4.1 achieves 79% F1 score for environmental message detection, while best models only achieve 46% F1 for green innovation framing identification, highlighting room for improvement.

Conclusion: The dataset enables multimodal analysis of strategic communication in energy sector, identifying key challenges for VLMs including implicit framing, variable video lengths, and cultural context handling.

Abstract: Companies spend large amounts of money on public relations campaigns to
project a positive brand image. However, sometimes there is a mismatch between
what they say and what they do. Oil & gas companies, for example, are accused
of "greenwashing" with imagery of climate-friendly initiatives. Understanding
the framing, and changes in framing, at scale can help better understand the
goals and nature of public relations campaigns. To address this, we introduce a
benchmark dataset of expert-annotated video ads obtained from Facebook and
YouTube. The dataset provides annotations for 13 framing types for more than 50
companies or advocacy groups across 20 countries. Our dataset is especially
designed for the evaluation of vision-language models (VLMs), distinguishing it
from past text-only framing datasets. Baseline experiments show some promising
results, while leaving room for improvement for future work: GPT-4.1 can detect
environmental messages with 79% F1 score, while our best model only achieves
46% F1 score on identifying framing around green innovation. We also identify
challenges that VLMs must address, such as implicit framing, handling videos of
various lengths, or implicit cultural backgrounds. Our dataset contributes to
research in multimodal analysis of strategic communication in the energy
sector.

TL;DR: A Knowledge Graph framework bridges the semantic gap between high-level mission objectives and low-level planner inputs for autonomous agents, enabling adaptive coordination through declarative policy changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the semantic gap between high-level mission objectives and low-level planner inputs that hampers coordination of autonomous agents in dynamic environments.

Method: Introduces a Knowledge Graph with two-plane architecture that compiles declarative facts into per-agent mission-aware worldviews and physics-aware traversal rules, decoupling mission semantics from domain-agnostic planning.

Result: Case study with Autonomous Underwater Vehicles demonstrates the end-to-end process and shows that different declarative policies produce distinct, high-performing outcomes.

Conclusion: Establishes Knowledge Graphs as powerful stateful orchestrators for creating adaptive and explainable autonomous systems, not just data repositories.

Abstract: The coordination of autonomous agents in dynamic environments is hampered by
the semantic gap between high-level mission objectives and low-level planner
inputs. To address this, we introduce a framework centered on a Knowledge Graph
(KG) that functions as an intelligent translation layer. The KG's two-plane
architecture compiles declarative facts into per-agent, mission-aware
``worldviews" and physics-aware traversal rules, decoupling mission semantics
from a domain-agnostic planner. This allows complex, coordinated paths to be
modified simply by changing facts in the KG. A case study involving Autonomous
Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) in the Gulf of Mexico visually demonstrates the
end-to-end process and quantitatively proves that different declarative
policies produce distinct, high-performing outcomes. This work establishes the
KG not merely as a data repository, but as a powerful, stateful orchestrator
for creating adaptive and explainable autonomous systems.

### [112] [A Multiscale Approach for Enhancing Weak Signal Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20828)
*Dixon Vimalajeewa,Ursula U. Muller,Brani Vidakovic*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper proposes a double-threshold stochastic resonance (SR) system that enhances weak signal detection by integrating two single-threshold detectors, with improved performance in both original data and multiscale domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SR techniques using single-threshold detectors are limited to time-independent signals and often require excessive noise that distorts complex signal characteristics. The study aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: The authors developed a double-threshold detection system that integrates two single-threshold detectors, evaluated in both original data domain and multiscale domain using wavelet transforms with simulated and real-world signals.

Result: The double-threshold detector significantly improves weak signal detection compared to conventional single-threshold approaches in the original data domain, with further performance improvement in the frequency domain requiring lower noise levels.

Conclusion: This study advances SR-based detection methodologies by introducing a robust approach to weak signal identification with potential applications across various disciplines.

Abstract: Stochastic resonance (SR), a phenomenon originally introduced in climate
modeling, enhances signal detection by leveraging optimal noise levels within
non-linear systems. Traditional SR techniques, mainly based on single-threshold
detectors, are limited to signals whose behavior does not depend on time. Often
large amounts of noise are needed to detect weak signals, which can distort
complex signal characteristics. To address these limitations, this study
explores multi-threshold systems and the application of SR in multiscale
applications using wavelet transforms. In the multiscale domain signals can be
analyzed at different levels of resolution to better understand the underlying
dynamics.
  We propose a double-threshold detection system that integrates two
single-threshold detectors to enhance weak signal detection. We evaluate it
both in the original data domain and in the multiscale domain using simulated
and real-world signals and compare its performance with existing methods.
  Experimental results demonstrate that, in the original data domain, the
proposed double-threshold detector significantly improves weak signal detection
compared to conventional single-threshold approaches. Its performance is
further improved in the frequency domain, requiring lower noise levels while
outperforming existing detection systems. This study advances SR-based
detection methodologies by introducing a robust approach to weak signal
identification, with potential applications in various disciplines.

*Martin Andersson,Anubhab Chowdhury,Erik G. Larsson*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A framework for optimizing repeater gain in dynamic TDD massive MIMO networks, balancing signal amplification with interference control through joint amplification and phase shift optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Repeaters amplify both desired signals and interference in dynamic TDD systems, creating a trade-off that needs optimization to improve network performance.

Method: Derived DL and UL spectral efficiencies, then developed a repeater gain optimization algorithm for SE maximization through joint amplification and phase shift control.

Result: The proposed algorithm successfully calibrates repeater gain to amplify desired signals while limiting interference in dynamic TDD systems.

Conclusion: Joint optimization of repeater gain can effectively balance signal amplification and interference control in massive MIMO networks with dynamic TDD.

Abstract: We present a framework for joint amplification and phase shift optimization
of the repeater gain in dynamic time-division duplex (TDD) repeater-assisted
massive MIMO networks. Repeaters, being active scatterers with amplification
and phase shift, enhance the received signal strengths for users. However, they
inevitably also amplify undesired noise and interference signals, which become
particularly prominent in dynamic TDD systems due to the concurrent downlink
(DL) and uplink (UL) transmissions, introducing cross-link interference among
access points and users operating in opposite transmit directions. This causes
a non-trivial trade-off between amplification of desired and undesired signals.
To underpin the conditions under which such a trade-off can improve
performance, we first derive DL and UL spectral efficiencies (SEs), and then
develop a repeater gain optimization algorithm for SE maximization.
Numerically, we show that our proposed algorithm successfully calibrates the
repeater gain to amplify the desired signal while limiting the interference.

*Zhonglun Wang,Yizhe Zhao,Gangming Hu,Yali Zheng,Kun Yang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A 6D movable holographic surface (6DMHS) system is proposed to improve integrated data and energy transfer (IDET) performance by addressing directional fluctuations in holographic beamforming through a three-stage protocol involving sensing, orientation adjustment, and transmission optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconfigurable holographic surfaces (RHS) suffer from directional fluctuations in amplitude-controlled holographic beamforming, limiting their spatial gain exploitation. 6D movable antennas (6DMA) offer a potential solution to this problem.

Method: A three-stage protocol: 1) Uplink sensing using holographic-based technology to gather receiver information, 2) Orientation adjustment by optimizing holographic beamforming and 6DMHS translations to align maximum beamforming gain with receivers, 3) Downlink transmission with optimized digital beamforming, power splitting, and energy harvesting power.

Result: Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed 6DMHS scheme improves IDET performance compared to benchmark methods.

Conclusion: The 6DMHS system effectively coordinates holographic beamforming and movable antenna technology to overcome directional fluctuations and enhance integrated data and energy transfer performance.

Abstract: Reconfigurable holographic surface (RHS) enables cost-effective large-scale
arrays with high spatial gain. However, its amplitude-controlled holographic
beamforming suffers from directional fluctuations, making it difficult to fully
exploit the spatial gain of RHS. Fortunately, the promising 6D movable antenna
(6DMA) provides a potential solution to this problem. In this paper, we study a
6D movable holographic surface (6DMHS) integrated data and energy transfer
(IDET) system, where a three-stage protocol is proposed, consisting of an
uplink sensing stage, an orientation adjustment stage and a downlink
transmission stage, to coordinate the 6DMHS and effectively serve the IDET
receivers. Firstly, the holographic-based sensing technology is proposed and
the sensing information of the IDET receivers is exploited. Secondly, by fixing
the rotations with the sensing information, the orientation optimization
problem is formulated for designing the holographic beamforming of the RHS and
adjusting the translations of the 6DMHS. As a result, the directions with
maximum beamforming gain are aligned with each IDET receiver. Thirdly, by
fixing the orientation of the 6DMHS and the holographic beamforming, the
equivalent wireless channel is obtained. The IDET performance optimization
problem is formulated for obtaining the optimal digital beamforming, power
splitting factor and energy harvesting (EH) power. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed scheme is capable of improving the IDET
performance compared to the benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient integrated sensing and edge AI system that enables collaborative inference through analog over-the-air computation, addressing the relationship between AirComp error and inference performance.

Method: Established two proxies (computation-optimal and decision-optimal) to characterize AirComp error vs inference performance relationship. Derived optimal transceiver designs with closed-form power allocation for both TDM and FDM settings.

Result: Theoretical analysis revealed threshold-based structure for TDM and dual-decomposition structure for FDM. Experimental results validated the theoretical findings.

Conclusion: The proposed ISEA system with optimal transceiver designs effectively enables collaborative inference through analog AirComp, with different structural characteristics for TDM and FDM implementations.

Abstract: This work investigates an integrated sensing and edge artificial intelligence
(ISEA) system, where multiple devices first transmit probing signals for target
sensing and then offload locally extracted features to the access point (AP)
via analog over-the-air computation (AirComp) for collaborative inference. To
characterize the relationship between AirComp error and inference performance,
two proxies are established: the \emph{computation-optimal} proxy that
minimizes the aggregation distortion, and the \emph{decision-optimal} proxy
that maximizes the inter-class separability, respectively. Optimal transceiver
designs in terms of closed-form power allocation are derived for both
time-division multiplexing (TDM) and frequency-division multiplexing (FDM)
settings, revealing threshold-based and dual-decomposition structures,
respectively. Experimental results validate the theoretical findings.

Motivation: To evaluate the accuracy of commonly used log-normal distribution for modeling weak turbulence in irradiance fluctuations.

Method: Experimental comparison of log-normal and Gamma-Gamma distributions for modeling irradiance fluctuations in weak turbulence.

Result: Log-normal distribution fails to capture irradiance fluctuations in weak turbulence regime; Gamma-Gamma model shows better accuracy.

Conclusion: Gamma-Gamma model is more suitable than log-normal distribution for modeling weak turbulence in irradiance fluctuations.

Abstract: Weak turbulence is commonly modeled using the log-normal distribution. Our
experimental results show that this distribution fails to capture irradiance
fluctuations in this regime. The Gamma-Gamma model is shown to be more
accurate.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a tighter likelihood bound for noise-driven generative models, extending beyond Gaussian assumptions to arbitrary noise perturbations, which improves accuracy and efficiency in maximum likelihood learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Perturbation-based generative models face slow convergence and limited theoretical understanding. The authors aim to address these limitations by deriving a tighter likelihood bound that works with arbitrary noise distributions.

Method: Extends the classical KL divergence Fisher information relationship to arbitrary noise perturbations, treats diffusion as a Gaussian channel, and expresses mismatched entropy between data and model. The framework remains compatible with standard diffusion training.

Result: Achieved competitive NLL on CIFAR-10 and state-of-the-art results on ImageNet across multiple resolutions without data augmentation. The framework also extends naturally to discrete data.

Conclusion: The proposed tighter likelihood bound enables more flexible use of randomized noise distributions while improving both accuracy and efficiency in maximum likelihood learning for generative models.

Abstract: Generative models that maximize model likelihood have gained traction in many
practical settings. Among them, perturbation based approaches underpin many
strong likelihood estimation models, yet they often face slow convergence and
limited theoretical understanding. In this paper, we derive a tighter
likelihood bound for noise driven models to improve both the accuracy and
efficiency of maximum likelihood learning. Our key insight extends the
classical KL divergence Fisher information relationship to arbitrary noise
perturbations, going beyond the Gaussian assumption and enabling structured
noise distributions. This formulation allows flexible use of randomized noise
distributions that naturally account for sensor artifacts, quantization
effects, and data distribution smoothing, while remaining compatible with
standard diffusion training. Treating the diffusion process as a Gaussian
channel, we further express the mismatched entropy between data and model,
showing that the proposed objective upper bounds the negative log-likelihood
(NLL). In experiments, our models achieve competitive NLL on CIFAR-10 and SOTA
results on ImageNet across multiple resolutions, all without data augmentation,
and the framework extends naturally to discrete data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Shor code has simple structure but low code rate, needing improvement in efficiency.

Method: Overlap a small number of repetition codes instead of using two separate repetition codes as inner and outer codes.

Result: Achieved fourfold increase in asymptotic code rate and reduced overhead from [[9,1,3]] to [[7,1,3]] for minimal distance d=3.

Conclusion: Overlapping repetition codes provides more efficient quantum error correction with higher code rates and reduced overhead compared to standard Shor code.

Abstract: The standard Shor code employs two repetition codes as inner and outer codes,
yielding a simple structure but a relatively low code rate. By overlapping a
small number of repetition codes, we enhance the asymptotic code rate fourfold.
In the minimal-distance case $d = 3$, this construction reduces the overhead
from $[[9,1,3]]$ to the more efficient $[[7,1,3]]$ configuration.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: A hybrid DNA synthesis framework that combines constrained and parallel nucleotide additions, with theoretical analysis of information rates and algorithms for optimal synthesis sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNA storage has density and durability advantages but scalability is limited by synthesis efficiency. Existing methods are either unconstrained (enzymatic) or fully parallel (photolithographic), creating a need for a hybrid approach.

Method: Introduces a hybrid synthesis model with restricted nucleotide subsets per cycle, analyzes information rates using deletion ball analog, and develops dynamic programming algorithms for optimal synthesis sequences.

Result: Derived tight expressions for maximal information rate and asymptotic behavior, bridging theoretical gaps between constrained and idealized models. Developed efficient algorithms for computing optimal synthesis sequences.

Conclusion: Establishes a comprehensive theoretical framework for constrained DNA synthesis that subsumes prior models and enables future advances in scalable DNA storage systems.

Abstract: DNA-based storage offers unprecedented density and durability, but its
scalability is fundamentally limited by the efficiency of parallel strand
synthesis. Existing methods either allow unconstrained nucleotide additions to
individual strands, such as enzymatic synthesis, or enforce identical additions
across many strands, such as photolithographic synthesis. We introduce and
analyze a hybrid synthesis framework that generalizes both approaches: in each
cycle, a nucleotide is selected from a restricted subset and incorporated in
parallel. This model gives rise to a new notion of a complex synthesis
sequence. Building on this framework, we extend the information rate definition
of Lenz et al. and analyze an analog of the deletion ball, defined and studied
in this setting, deriving tight expressions for the maximal information rate
and its asymptotic behavior. These results bridge the theoretical gap between
constrained models and the idealized setting in which every nucleotide is
always available. For the case of known strands, we design a dynamic
programming algorithm that computes an optimal complex synthesis sequence,
highlighting structural similarities to the shortest common supersequence
problem. We also define a distinct two-dimensional array model with synthesis
constraints over the rows, which extends previous synthesis models in the
literature and captures new structural limitations in large-scale strand
arrays. Additionally, we develop a dynamic programming algorithm for this
problem as well. Our results establish a new and comprehensive theoretical
framework for constrained DNA, subsuming prior models and setting the stage for
future advances in the field.

*Shengkang Chen,Tong Wu,Zhiyong Chen,Feng Yang,Meixia Tao,Wenjun Zhang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: A generative communication framework using diffusion models for reliable image transmission at extremely low rates, combining joint source-channel coding with semantic-guided reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional compression and channel coding schemes fail to preserve adequate visual quality at extremely low transmission rates over wireless channels.

Method: Proposes a framework that encodes source images via JSCC, transmits them with textual prompts, and reconstructs corrupted low-rate representations using Stable Diffusion with ControlNet, leveraging generative priors and semantic guidance.

Result: The method consistently outperforms conventional coding-based schemes and deep learning baselines, achieving superior perceptual quality and robustness across various channel conditions.

Conclusion: The generative communication framework effectively preserves semantically meaningful visual content under severe rate constraints, ensuring perceptual plausibility and faithfulness to scene intent.

Abstract: Reliable image transmission over wireless channels is particularly
challenging at extremely low transmission rates, where conventional compression
and channel coding schemes fail to preserve adequate visual quality. To address
this issue, we propose a generative communication framework based on diffusion
models, which integrates joint source channel coding (JSCC) with
semantic-guided reconstruction leveraging a pre-trained generative model.
Unlike conventional architectures that aim to recover exact pixel values of the
original image, the proposed method focuses on preserving and reconstructing
semantically meaningful visual content under severely constrained rates,
ensuring perceptual plausibility and faithfulness to the scene intent.
Specifically, the transmitter encodes the source image via JSCC and jointly
transmits it with a textual prompt over the wireless channel. At the receiver,
the corrupted low-rate representation is fused with the prompt and
reconstructed through a Stable Diffusion model with ControlNet, enabling
high-quality visual recovery. Leveraging both generative priors and semantic
guidance, the proposed framework produces perceptually convincing images even
under extreme bandwidth limitations. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method consistently outperforms conventional coding-based schemes and
deep learning baselines, achieving superior perceptual quality and robustness
across various channel conditions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep generative models can learn complex prior distributions of wireless channels, offering a powerful alternative to conventional channel estimation methods.

Method: Uses a lightweight LDM architecture as generative prior, enhances diffusion posterior sampling with likelihood approximation and self-consistency constraint on VAE latent space.

Result: Extensive experiments show PSLD-CE consistently outperforms existing methods while maintaining low computational complexity and fast inference speed.

Conclusion: PSLD-CE establishes a highly promising and practical solution for next-generation wireless systems.

Abstract: Deep generative models offer a powerful alternative to conventional channel
estimation by learning the complex prior distribution of wireless channels.
Capitalizing on this potential, this paper proposes a novel channel estimation
algorithm based on latent diffusion models (LDMs), termed posterior sampling
with latent diffusion for channel estimation (PSLD-CE). The core of our
approach is a lightweight LDM architecture specifically designed for channel
estimation, which serves as a powerful generative prior to capture the
intricate channel distribution. Furthermore, we enhance the diffusion posterior
sampling process by introducing an effective approximation for the likelihood
term and a tailored self-consistency constraint on the variational autoencoder
latent space. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PSLD-CE
consistently outperforms a wide range of existing methods. Notably, these
significant performance gains are achieved while maintaining low computational
complexity and fast inference speed, establishing our method as a highly
promising and practical solution for next-generation wireless systems.

*Hoang Ly,Emina Soljanin*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: A framework that reduces ML decoding complexity from O(q^k n) to O(q^k) operations for arbitrary block codes using vector-matrix multiplication and the Mailman algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maximum-likelihood decoding for arbitrary block codes has high computational complexity (O(q^k n)), making it impractical for many applications. The goal is to achieve significant complexity reduction while maintaining ML performance.

Method: Express conditional probabilities as inner products of carefully constructed vectors, reducing ML decoding to a single vector-matrix multiplication. Use the Mailman algorithm to optimize the matrix multiplication cost. The approach works for both linear/nonlinear codes and hard/soft-decision decoding.

Result: Achieves worst-case complexity reduction by a factor of n, from O(q^k n) to O(q^k) operations. The method extends to ISI channels and ML list decoding with minimal complexity increase.

Conclusion: The framework provides substantial practical complexity reduction for ML decoding at the cost of increased space complexity (O(q^{k+1} n)), making ML decoding more feasible for various coding scenarios.

Abstract: Maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding for arbitrary block codes remains
fundamentally hard, with worst-case time complexity-measured by the total
number of multiplications-being no better than straightforward exhaustive
search, which requires $q^{k} n$ operations for an $[n,k]_q$ code. This paper
introduces a simple, code-agnostic framework that reduces the worst-case
complexity by a factor of $n$, down to $q^{k}$ operations, a highly desirable
reduction in practice. The result holds for both linear and nonlinear block
codes over general memoryless channels and under both hard-decision and
soft-decision decoding. It naturally extends to intersymbol-interference (ISI)
channels and ML list decoding with only a negligible increase in complexity.
Our core insight is that, upon receipt of each sequence at the receiver, the
conditional probability of that sequence for each codeword in the codebook
(i.e., the \emph{likelihood}) can be expressed as the inner product of two
carefully constructed vectors -- the first depending on the received sequence,
and the second on that codeword itself. As a result, evaluating the likelihoods
for all codewords in the codebook reduces to a single vector-matrix
multiplication, and ML decoding (MLD) becomes the simple task of picking the
maximum entry in the resulting vector. The only non-trivial cost lies in the
vector-matrix product. However, our matrix construction allows the use of the
Mailman algorithm to reduce this cost. This time reduction is achieved at the
cost of high space complexity, requiring $\mathcal{O}(q^{k+1} n)$ space to
store the pre-computed codebook matrix.

*Bho Matthiesen,Armin Dekorsy,Petar Popovski*

TL;DR: The paper examines AI challenges for resilient 5G networks, highlighting limitations of statistical learning for handling unanticipated disruptions and suggesting online learning and causal inference as promising alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G networks need resilience to handle unexpected failures and operating conditions that weren't anticipated during design, especially when statistical models are unavailable or too complex.

Method: Theoretical analysis of AI design challenges for resilient radio access networks, focusing on limitations of current statistical learning methods.

Result: Found strong limitations of statistical learning methods for achieving resilience, particularly for unanticipated and rare disruptions.

Conclusion: Online learning and causal inference show promise as alternative approaches to deliver AI-driven resilience in 5G networks beyond traditional statistical methods.

Abstract: 5G networks offer exceptional reliability and availability, ensuring
consistent performance and user satisfaction. Yet they might still fail when
confronted with the unexpected. A resilient system is able to adapt to
real-world complexity, including operating conditions completely unanticipated
during system design. This makes resilience a vital attribute for communication
systems that must sustain service in scenarios where models are absent or too
intricate to provide statistical guarantees. Such considerations indicate that
artifical intelligence (AI) will play a major role in delivering resilience. In
this paper, we examine the challenges of designing AIs for resilient radio
access networks, especially with respect to unanticipated and rare disruptions.
Our theoretical results indicate strong limitations of current statistical
learning methods for resilience and suggest connections to online learning and
causal inference.

### [124] [Incentivizing Consistent, Effective and Scalable Reasoning Capability in Audio LLMs via Reasoning Process Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20867)
*Jiajun Fan,Roger Ren,Jingyuan Li,Rahul Pandey,Prashanth Gurunath Shivakumar,Ivan Bulyko,Ankur Gandhe,Ge Liu,Yile Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CESAR is a reinforcement learning framework that addresses test-time inverse scaling in Audio LLMs by rewarding the reasoning process itself rather than just outcomes, achieving state-of-the-art performance on audio reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Audio LLMs suffer from test-time inverse scaling where longer reasoning chains degrade performance due to inadequate training that produces hallucinatory and inconsistent reasoning.

Method: Online reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization and multi-faceted rewards that incentivize correctness, format, consistency, structured analysis, causal reasoning, domain knowledge, and calibrated reasoning depth.

Result: Resolves test-time inverse scaling, achieves SOTA on MMAU Test-mini outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4o Audio, near-human performance on MMSU reasoning tasks, and creates synergistic improvements in multimodal reasoning and perception.

Conclusion: CESAR establishes a principled method for developing robust and scalable reasoning in Audio LLMs by shifting focus from outcome verification to rewarding the reasoning process.

Abstract: The role of reasoning in Audio Large Language Models remains widely
underexplored, as introducing a reasoning process often degrades rather than
improves performance during inference, a phenomenon we term test-time inverse
scaling, where longer reasoning chains yield progressively worse results. We
demonstrate that this stems not from fundamental limitations of reasoning
itself, but from inadequate training: models without proper guidance for the
reasoning process produce hallucinatory, inconsistent reasoning that
accumulates errors over longer chains. To address these challenges, we
introduce CESAR (Consistent, Effective, and Scalable Audio Reasoners), shifting
from outcome verification to rewarding the reasoning process. Our online
reinforcement learning framework employs Group Relative Policy Optimization
with a multi-faceted reward suite that incentivizes not only correctness and
format but also consistency, structured analytical patterns, causal reasoning,
domain-knowledge integration, and calibrated reasoning depth. CESAR resolves
test-time inverse scaling, transforming reasoning from detriments into gains
while revealing model-specific ``reasoning sweet spots", where performance
peaks during test-time scaling. We achieve state-of-the-art results on MMAU
Test-mini, substantially outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4o Audio, and
near-human-level performance on MMSU reasoning tasks. Through AI-as-judge
evaluations and qualitative comparisons, we provide both quantitative and
qualitative validation of our improved reasoning quality. Importantly, enhanced
reasoning creates synergistic effects, simultaneously improving multimodal
reasoning and perception capabilities. Overall, CESAR establishes a principled
method for developing robust and scalable reasoning in Audio LLMs.

*Zan Li,Rui Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CRISP is a graph-based spatio-temporal learning framework that adaptively learns asset correlation structures during different market crises, outperforming fixed-topology methods by filtering 92.5% of connections as noise while preserving crisis-relevant dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based methods use predetermined graph topologies that fail to adapt when market dynamics shift across different crisis mechanisms like credit contagion, pandemic shocks, or inflation-driven selloffs.

Method: Uses Graph Convolutional Networks for spatial relationships, BiLSTM with self-attention for temporal dynamics, and multi-head Graph Attention Networks to learn sparse structures and discover which asset relationships matter through attention mechanisms.

Result: Achieves Sharpe ratio 3.76 (707% improvement over equal-weight baselines, 94% improvement over static graph methods), generalizes to fundamentally different regimes (2022-2024 inflation-driven markets), and provides interpretable regime detection through attention weights.

Conclusion: CRISP enables adaptive portfolio allocation that maintains profitability during downturns by learning crisis-resilient correlation structures from data rather than imposing assumptions, with emergent behavior from learning to forecast.

Abstract: Financial time series forecasting faces a fundamental challenge: predicting
optimal asset allocations requires understanding regime-dependent correlation
structures that transform during crisis periods. Existing graph-based
spatio-temporal learning approaches rely on predetermined graph
topologies--correlation thresholds, sector classifications--that fail to adapt
when market dynamics shift across different crisis mechanisms: credit
contagion, pandemic shocks, or inflation-driven selloffs.
  We present CRISP (Crisis-Resilient Investment through Spatio-temporal
Patterns), a graph-based spatio-temporal learning framework that encodes
spatial relationships via Graph Convolutional Networks and temporal dynamics
via BiLSTM with self-attention, then learns sparse structures through
multi-head Graph Attention Networks. Unlike fixed-topology methods, CRISP
discovers which asset relationships matter through attention mechanisms,
filtering 92.5% of connections as noise while preserving crisis-relevant
dependencies for accurate regime-specific predictions.
  Trained on 2005--2021 data encompassing credit and pandemic crises, CRISP
demonstrates robust generalization to 2022--2024 inflation-driven markets--a
fundamentally different regime--by accurately forecasting regime-appropriate
correlation structures. This enables adaptive portfolio allocation that
maintains profitability during downturns, achieving Sharpe ratio 3.76: 707%
improvement over equal-weight baselines and 94% improvement over static graph
methods. Learned attention weights provide interpretable regime detection, with
defensive cluster attention strengthening 49% during crises versus 31%
market-wide--emergent behavior from learning to forecast rather than imposing
assumptions.

*Lam Ngo,Huong Ha,Jeffrey Chan,Hongyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MOBO-OSD is a multi-objective Bayesian optimization algorithm that generates diverse Pareto optimal solutions using orthogonal search directions and Pareto Front Estimation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on 2-6 objective problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-objective Bayesian optimization remains challenging compared to single-objective optimization, requiring methods that can efficiently generate diverse Pareto optimal solutions across the objective space.

Method: Proposes MOBO-OSD algorithm that solves multiple constrained optimization problems along orthogonal search directions defined with respect to an approximated convex hull of individual objective minima, uses Pareto Front Estimation for solution density, and supports batch optimization for parallel evaluations.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmark functions with 2-6 objectives show MOBO-OSD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in solution diversity and hypervolume performance.

Conclusion: MOBO-OSD effectively addresses multi-objective optimization challenges by ensuring broad objective space coverage and solution density, making it a superior approach for expensive black-box multi-objective optimization problems.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a powerful tool for optimizing expensive
black-box objective functions. While extensive research has been conducted on
the single-objective optimization problem, the multi-objective optimization
problem remains challenging. In this paper, we propose MOBO-OSD, a
multi-objective Bayesian Optimization algorithm designed to generate a diverse
set of Pareto optimal solutions by solving multiple constrained optimization
problems, referred to as MOBO-OSD subproblems, along orthogonal search
directions (OSDs) defined with respect to an approximated convex hull of
individual objective minima. By employing a well-distributed set of OSDs,
MOBO-OSD ensures broad coverage of the objective space, enhancing both solution
diversity and hypervolume performance. To further improve the density of the
set of Pareto optimal candidate solutions without requiring an excessive number
of subproblems, we leverage a Pareto Front Estimation technique to generate
additional solutions in the neighborhood of existing solutions. Additionally,
MOBO-OSD supports batch optimization, enabling parallel function evaluations to
accelerate the optimization process when resources are available. Through
extensive experiments and analysis on a variety of synthetic and real-world
benchmark functions with two to six objectives, we demonstrate that MOBO-OSD
consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms. Our code
implementation can be found at https://github.com/LamNgo1/mobo-osd.

### [128] [Multimodal Negative Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20877)
*Baoquan Gong,Xiyuan Gao,Pengfei Zhu,Qinghua Hu,Bing Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Multimodal Negative Learning (MNL) - a new paradigm where dominant modalities guide weak modalities to suppress non-target classes rather than forcing alignment, addressing modality imbalance while preserving unique information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address modality imbalance in multimodal learning where dominant modalities overshadow weak ones, avoiding suppression of unique information in weak modalities that occurs with conventional positive learning approaches.

Method: Introduces 'Learning Not to be' (Negative Learning) paradigm where dominant modalities dynamically guide weak modality to suppress non-target classes, stabilizing decision space and preserving modality-specific information through theoretical MNL framework.

Result: Theoretically tightens robustness lower bound by increasing Unimodal Confidence Margin (UCoM), reduces empirical error of weak modalities under noisy/imbalanced scenarios, and shows effectiveness across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: MNL provides a robust alternative to conventional positive learning, effectively handling modality imbalance while preserving unique information in weak modalities, with proven theoretical guarantees and empirical success.

Abstract: Multimodal learning systems often encounter challenges related to modality
imbalance, where a dominant modality may overshadow others, thereby hindering
the learning of weak modalities. Conventional approaches often force weak
modalities to align with dominant ones in "Learning to be (the same)" (Positive
Learning), which risks suppressing the unique information inherent in the weak
modalities. To address this challenge, we offer a new learning paradigm:
"Learning Not to be" (Negative Learning). Instead of enhancing weak modalities'
target-class predictions, the dominant modalities dynamically guide the weak
modality to suppress non-target classes. This stabilizes the decision space and
preserves modality-specific information, allowing weak modalities to preserve
unique information without being over-aligned. We proceed to reveal multimodal
learning from a robustness perspective and theoretically derive the Multimodal
Negative Learning (MNL) framework, which introduces a dynamic guidance
mechanism tailored for negative learning. Our method provably tightens the
robustness lower bound of multimodal learning by increasing the Unimodal
Confidence Margin (UCoM) and reduces the empirical error of weak modalities,
particularly under noisy and imbalanced scenarios. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
approach against competing methods. The code will be available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HA-RAG is a hotness-aware inference optimization system for Retrieval-Augmented Generation that accelerates inference by 2.10x on average and up to 10.49x in Time-To-First-Token through mixed-precision compression and smart data placement based on KV chunk access frequency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG addresses LLM hallucination and knowledge-update issues but introduces challenges in long-context processing, significantly increasing memory consumption and inference latency. Existing methods precompute KV from knowledge bases but still face performance bottlenecks.

Method: Proposes hotness-aware RAG with: 1) mixed-precision compression and loading based on KV chunk numerical distribution to reduce I/O overhead, 2) data placement strategy that prioritizes frequently accessed KV chunks in high-speed memory.

Result: Achieves average 2.10x speedup and maximum 10.49x speedup in Time-To-First-Token compared to TurboRAG, with negligible accuracy loss.

Conclusion: HA-RAG effectively optimizes RAG inference performance through hotness-aware techniques, significantly reducing latency while maintaining accuracy, making it a practical solution for real-world RAG applications.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves model output accuracy by
leveraging external knowledge bases, serving as an effective solution to
address hallucination issues and knowledge-update delays in Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, the introduction of external knowledge bases presents
RAG with challenges in long-context processing, significantly increasing memory
consumption and inference latency. Existing research accelerates inference by
precomputing Key and Value (KV) of the knowledge base and loading them
on-demand during inference. Based on the access frequency of different KV
chunks within the external knowledge base, this paper proposes a hotness-aware
RAG (HA-RAG) inference optimization system. First, leveraging the numerical
distribution of KV chunks, we introduce a hotness-aware mixed-precision
compressing and loading method to reduce disk I/O and memory access overhead.
Second, we design a hotness-aware data placement strategy that prioritizes
storing frequently accessed KV chunks in high-speed memory to improve data
access efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with
TurboRAG, the proposed HA-RAG achieves an average speedup of 2.10x and maximum
speedup of 10.49x in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) with negligible accuracy loss.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lagrangian duality is popular for constrained learning, but Augmented Lagrangian methods are underexplored despite their ability to mitigate duality gaps in non-convex settings with minimal modifications.

Method: Augmented Lagrangian methods are applied to constrained learning problems, with analysis of strong duality conditions and convergence of dual ascent algorithms.

Result: The paper establishes strong duality under mild conditions, proves convergence to feasible and optimal primal solutions, and provides PAC-style generalization guarantees.

Conclusion: Augmented Lagrangian methods are effective for constrained learning, particularly demonstrated on fairness-constrained classification tasks, offering strong theoretical guarantees and practical performance.

Abstract: Despite the non-convexity of most modern machine learning parameterizations,
Lagrangian duality has become a popular tool for addressing constrained

mitigate the duality gap in non-convex settings while requiring only minimal

convergence of dual ascent algorithms to feasible and optimal primal solutions,
and provide PAC-style generalization guarantees. Finally, we demonstrate its
effectiveness on fairness constrained classification tasks.

*Xingyu Wang,Chang-Han Rhee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Heavy-tailed SGD with gradient clipping can avoid sharp local minima and achieve better generalization performance by injecting and truncating heavy-tailed noises during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Theoretical understanding of SGD's ability to avoid sharp local minima lags behind empirical success. Need comprehensive global dynamics analysis to enhance SGD's capability.

Method: Develop technical machinery based on large deviations and metastability analysis. Inject and truncate heavy-tailed noises during training phase with gradient clipping.

Result: Heavy-tailed SGD almost completely avoids sharp minima and finds local minima with more flat geometry. Achieves better generalization performance for test data.

Conclusion: Heavy-tailed SGD with gradient clipping is an effective method to improve generalization by avoiding sharp local minima through noise injection and truncation.

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants enable modern artificial
intelligence. However, theoretical understanding lags far behind their
empirical success. It is widely believed that SGD has a curious ability to
avoid sharp local minima in the loss landscape, which are associated with poor
generalization. To unravel this mystery and further enhance such capability of
SGDs, it is imperative to go beyond the traditional local convergence analysis
and obtain a comprehensive understanding of SGDs' global dynamics. In this
paper, we develop a set of technical machinery based on the recent large
deviations and metastability analysis in Wang and Rhee (2023) and obtain sharp
characterization of the global dynamics of heavy-tailed SGDs. In particular, we
reveal a fascinating phenomenon in deep learning: by injecting and then
truncating heavy-tailed noises during the training phase, SGD can almost
completely avoid sharp minima and achieve better generalization performance for
the test data. Simulation and deep learning experiments confirm our theoretical
prediction that heavy-tailed SGD with gradient clipping finds local minima with
a more flat geometry and achieves better generalization performance.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a MADDPG-COCG algorithm to optimize task offloading in SAGIN-MEC systems for low-altitude economy applications, addressing coordination challenges across heterogeneous nodes and complex environmental factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in SAGIN-MEC systems for low-altitude economy, including coordinating heterogeneous nodes, modeling mobility and network variability, and handling real-time decisions under partial observability with hybrid variables.

Method: Proposed hierarchical SAGIN-MEC architecture and MADDPG-COCG algorithm that combines multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient with convex optimization and coalitional game methods to optimize continuous temporal decisions and handle hybrid varying-dimensional decisions.

Result: Simulation results show significant improvements in user-centric performance metrics (aggregated UD cost, task completion delay, UD energy consumption) with slight increase in UAV energy consumption, plus superior convergence stability and scalability compared to benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed MADDPG-COCG algorithm effectively addresses the NP-hard optimization problem in SAGIN-MEC systems and demonstrates enhanced performance for low-altitude economy applications.

Abstract: Space-air-ground integrated multi-access edge computing (SAGIN-MEC) provides
a promising solution for the rapidly developing low-altitude economy (LAE) to
deliver flexible and wide-area computing services. However, fully realizing the
potential of SAGIN-MEC in the LAE presents significant challenges, including
coordinating decisions across heterogeneous nodes with different roles,
modeling complex factors such as mobility and network variability, and handling
real-time decision-making under partially observable environment with hybrid
variables. To address these challenges, we first present a hierarchical
SAGIN-MEC architecture that enables the coordination between user devices
(UDs), uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), and satellites. Then, we formulate a UD
cost minimization optimization problem (UCMOP) to minimize the UD cost by
jointly optimizing the task offloading ratio, UAV trajectory planning,
computing resource allocation, and UD association. We show that the UCMOP is an
NP-hard problem. To overcome this challenge, we propose a multi-agent deep
deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG)-convex optimization and coalitional game
(MADDPG-COCG) algorithm. Specifically, we employ the MADDPG algorithm to
optimize the continuous temporal decisions for heterogeneous nodes in the
partially observable SAGIN-MEC system. Moreover, we propose a convex
optimization and coalitional game (COCG) method to enhance the conventional
MADDPG by deterministically handling the hybrid and varying-dimensional
decisions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MADDPG-COCG
algorithm significantly enhances the user-centric performances in terms of the
aggregated UD cost, task completion delay, and UD energy consumption, with a
slight increase in UAV energy consumption, compared to the benchmark
algorithms. Moreover, the MADDPG-COCG algorithm shows superior convergence
stability and scalability.

TL;DR: The paper addresses regression with interval targets, where only upper and lower bounds on target values are available, and proposes novel loss functions and a min-max learning formulation with smoothness constraints to handle this problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional regression methods fail when exact target labels are unavailable due to cost or inherent uncertainties, requiring new approaches that work with interval targets instead of precise values.

Method: Proposes compatible loss functions for interval targets and a min-max learning formulation that minimizes against worst-case target labels within intervals, incorporating smoothness constraints to handle non-convex optimization.

Result: Establishes non-asymptotic generalization bounds and achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively handle regression with interval targets, providing theoretical guarantees and practical performance improvements over existing approaches.

Abstract: We study the problem of regression with interval targets, where only upper
and lower bounds on target values are available in the form of intervals. This
problem arises when the exact target label is expensive or impossible to
obtain, due to inherent uncertainties. In the absence of exact targets,
traditional regression loss functions cannot be used. First, we study the
methodology of using a loss functions compatible with interval targets, for
which we establish non-asymptotic generalization bounds based on smoothness of
the hypothesis class that significantly relaxing prior assumptions of
realizability and small ambiguity degree. Second, we propose a novel min-max
learning formulation: minimize against the worst-case (maximized) target labels
within the provided intervals. The maximization problem in the latter is
non-convex, but we show that good performance can be achieved with the
incorporation of smoothness constraints. Finally, we perform extensive
experiments on real-world datasets and show that our methods achieve
state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a meta-learning approach using MAML with novel mutation encoding for protein mutation property prediction, achieving significant improvements in cross-dataset generalization and training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current protein mutation prediction methods struggle with cross-dataset generalization due to heterogeneous experimental conditions and limited target domain data, creating a need for more adaptable approaches.

Method: Combines transformer architectures with Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) and introduces a novel mutation encoding strategy using separator tokens to directly incorporate mutations into sequence context.

Result: Achieved 29% better accuracy for functional fitness with 65% less training time, and 94% better accuracy for solubility with 55% faster training across three protein mutation datasets.

Conclusion: The framework establishes systematic meta-learning application to protein mutation analysis with effective mutation encoding, offering transformative methodology for cross-domain generalization in protein engineering.

Abstract: Protein mutations can have profound effects on biological function, making
accurate prediction of property changes critical for drug discovery, protein
engineering, and precision medicine. Current approaches rely on fine-tuning
protein-specific transformers for individual datasets, but struggle with
cross-dataset generalization due to heterogeneous experimental conditions and
limited target domain data. We introduce two key innovations: (1) the first
application of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) to protein mutation property
prediction, and (2) a novel mutation encoding strategy using separator tokens
to directly incorporate mutations into sequence context. We build upon
transformer architectures integrating them with MAML to enable rapid adaptation
to new tasks through minimal gradient steps rather than learning
dataset-specific patterns. Our mutation encoding addresses the critical
limitation where standard transformers treat mutation positions as unknown
tokens, significantly degrading performance. Evaluation across three diverse
protein mutation datasets (functional fitness, thermal stability, and
solubility) demonstrates significant advantages over traditional fine-tuning.
In cross-task evaluation, our meta-learning approach achieves 29% better
accuracy for functional fitness with 65% less training time, and 94% better
accuracy for solubility with 55% faster training. The framework maintains
consistent training efficiency regardless of dataset size, making it
particularly valuable for industrial applications and early-stage protein
design where experimental data is limited. This work establishes a systematic
application of meta-learning to protein mutation analysis and introduces an
effective mutation encoding strategy, offering transformative methodology for
cross-domain generalization in protein engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing forecasting methods have architectural limitations with fixed horizons and cannot model uncertainty, while real-world forecasting requires integrating structured time-series data with unstructured textual information.

Method: Combines state space models to capture temporal dynamics of latent states with pretrained LLMs that encode textual inputs for posterior state estimation and decode textual forecasts consistent with latent trajectories.

Result: Improves state-of-the-art by 13.20% on TextTimeCorpus benchmark while providing human-readable forecast summaries.

Conclusion: First work to unify LLMs and SSMs for joint numerical and textual prediction, offering a novel foundation for multimodal temporal reasoning.

Abstract: Forecasting in the real world requires integrating structured time-series
data with unstructured textual information, but existing methods are
architecturally limited by fixed input/output horizons and are unable to model
or quantify uncertainty. We address this challenge by introducing
LLM-integrated Bayesian State space models (LBS), a novel probabilistic
framework for multimodal temporal forecasting. At a high level, LBS consists of
two components: (1) a state space model (SSM) backbone that captures the
temporal dynamics of latent states from which both numerical and textual
observations are generated and (2) a pretrained large language model (LLM) that
is adapted to encode textual inputs for posterior state estimation and decode
textual forecasts consistent with the latent trajectory. This design enables
flexible lookback and forecast windows, principled uncertainty quantification,
and improved temporal generalization thanks to the well-suited inductive bias
of SSMs toward modeling dynamical systems. Experiments on the TextTimeCorpus
benchmark demonstrate that LBS improves the previous state-of-the-art by 13.20%
while providing human-readable summaries of each forecast. Our work is the
first to unify LLMs and SSMs for joint numerical and textual prediction,
offering a novel foundation for multimodal temporal reasoning.

*Jeff Pflueger,Michael Everett*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes using reversibility to prevent safety issues in model-free RL by checking action safety via model-predictive path integral control, requiring only black-box dynamics queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model-free RL lacks formal safety guarantees, and existing shielding methods need detailed safety specifications. Many safety issues are best characterized by invariance.

Method: Leverage reversibility to prevent safety issues. Use model-predictive path integral control to check safety of actions from learned policy during training. Only requires black-box dynamics queries.

Result: Algorithm successfully aborts before all unsafe actions while achieving comparable training progress to baseline PPO that violates safety.

Conclusion: Reversibility-based approach provides safety guarantees without explicit dynamics or constraint knowledge, maintaining training performance while preventing unsafe actions.

Abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning approaches are promising for control but
typically lack formal safety guarantees. Existing methods to shield or
otherwise provide these guarantees often rely on detailed knowledge of the
safety specifications. Instead, this work's insight is that many
difficult-to-specify safety issues are best characterized by invariance.
Accordingly, we propose to leverage reversibility as a method for preventing
these safety issues throughout the training process. Our method uses
model-predictive path integral control to check the safety of an action
proposed by a learned policy throughout training. A key advantage of this
approach is that it only requires the ability to query the black-box dynamics,
not explicit knowledge of the dynamics or safety constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm successfully aborts before all
unsafe actions, while still achieving comparable training progress to a
baseline PPO approach that is allowed to violate safety.

Abstract: Falls among elderly and disabled individuals remain a leading cause of injury
and mortality worldwide, necessitating robust, accurate, and privacy-aware fall
detection systems. Traditional fall detection approaches, whether centralized
or point-wise, often struggle with key challenges such as limited
generalizability, data privacy concerns, and variability in individual movement
behaviors. To address these limitations, we propose EPFL-an Ensembled Penalized
Federated Learning framework that integrates continual learning, personalized
modeling, and a novel Specialized Weighted Aggregation (SWA) strategy. EPFL
leverages wearable sensor data to capture sequential motion patterns while
preserving user privacy through homomorphic encryption and federated training.
Unlike existing federated models, EPFL incorporates both penalized local
training and ensemble-based inference to improve inter-client consistency and
adaptability to behavioral differences. Extensive experiments on a benchmark
fall detection dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving
a Recall of 88.31 percent and an F1-score of 89.94 percent, significantly
outperforming both centralized and baseline models. This work presents a
scalable, secure, and accurate solution for real-world fall detection in
healthcare settings, with strong potential for continuous improvement via its
adaptive feedback mechanism.

### [138] [Towards Scalable Oversight with Collaborative Multi-Agent Debate in Error Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20963)
*Yongqiang Chen,Gang Niu,James Cheng,Bo Han,Masashi Sugiyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ColMAD introduces a collaborative multi-agent debate protocol that reframes debate as a non-zero sum game to improve error detection in LLMs, outperforming competitive MAD by 19% and single-agent methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-diagnosis in LLMs is unreliable for complex tasks without external feedback. Traditional multi-agent debate protocols frame debate as zero-sum games, leading to debate hacking where debaters mislead judges rather than seeking truth.

Method: ColMAD reframes multi-agent debate as a non-zero sum game where agents collaboratively criticize each other to complement missing points, allowing the judge to make more informed conclusions based on comprehensive evidence.

Result: ColMAD significantly outperforms previous competitive MAD protocols by 19% and provides non-trivial improvements over single-agent methods in error detection tasks.

Conclusion: Collaborative multi-agent debate protocols like ColMAD are more effective for error detection in LLMs than competitive approaches, as they encourage truth-seeking behavior rather than game-winning strategies.

Abstract: Accurate detection of errors in large language models (LLM) responses is
central to the success of scalable oversight, or providing effective
supervision to superhuman intelligence. Yet, self-diagnosis is often unreliable
on complex tasks unless aided by reliable external feedback. Multi-agent debate
(MAD) seems to be a natural alternative to external feedback: multiple LLMs
provide complementary perspectives and cross-checks for error detection.
However, prior MAD protocols frame debate as a zero-sum game, where the
debaters compete to win the game instead of seeking the truth. Consequently, it
leads to debate hacking: debaters tend to mislead the judge by misinterpreting
the task or presenting overconfident claims, which introduce more mistakes and
underperform single-agent methods. To mitigate the issue, we introduce a new
collaborative MAD protocol, termed ColMAD, that reframes MAD as a non-zero sum
game. Specifically, ColMAD encourages multiple agents to criticize each other
in a supportive way, such that they can complement the missing points of each
other. Therefore, the judge agent can make a more informative conclusion based
on more comprehensive evidence. Empirically, we show that ColMAD significantly
outperforms previous competitive MAD by 19% and brings non-trivial improvements
over single-agent methods in error detection.

*Yanzhi Chen,Zijing Ou,Adrian Weller,Michael U. Gutmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new mutual information estimator that balances complexity and capacity using vector copula theory, achieving better performance than both flexible neural networks and simplified Gaussian models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mutual information estimators either require large amounts of data (neural networks) or fail to capture complex distributions (Gaussian copula), creating a need for a better trade-off between complexity and capacity.

Method: Proposes a principled interpolation between flexible neural networks and simplified Gaussian copula models using recent vector copula theory.

Result: The proposed estimator demonstrates advantages on state-of-the-art synthetic benchmarks and real-world data with diverse modalities.

Conclusion: Vector copula theory provides an effective framework for developing mutual information estimators that achieve better balance between model complexity and capacity.

Abstract: Estimating mutual information (MI) is a fundamental task in data science and
machine learning. Existing estimators mainly rely on either highly flexible
models (e.g., neural networks), which require large amounts of data, or overly
simplified models (e.g., Gaussian copula), which fail to capture complex
distributions. Drawing upon recent vector copula theory, we propose a
principled interpolation between these two extremes to achieve a better
trade-off between complexity and capacity. Experiments on state-of-the-art
synthetic benchmarks and real-world data with diverse modalities demonstrate
the advantages of the proposed estimator.

*Jubilee Lee,Daniele E. Schiavazzi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: INRs achieve high compression ratios (up to 230x) for hemodynamic fields with minimal errors, and accurately represent cardiovascular anatomies with sub-millimeter precision using specialized architectures like SIREN, MFN-Gabor, and MHE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the performance of implicit neural representations (INRs) in domain-specific applications like compressing hemodynamic fields and representing cardiovascular anatomies, as their accuracy remains insufficiently understood despite their resolution independence and memory efficiency.

Method: Investigated several strategies to mitigate spectral bias including specialized activation functions, fixed and trainable positional encoding, and linear combinations of nonlinear kernels. Tested on hemodynamic fields from numerical simulations and cardiovascular anatomies via signed distance functions.

Result: On hemodynamic fields: achieved compression ratios up to ~230 with maximum absolute errors of 1 mmHg for pressure and 5-10 cm/s for velocity. On 48 thoracic aortic anatomies: average absolute anatomical discrepancies below 0.5 mm and maximum below 1.6 mm.

Conclusion: SIREN, MFN-Gabor, and MHE architectures demonstrated the best performance for compressing hemodynamic fields and representing cardiovascular anatomies using implicit neural representations.

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs, also known as neural fields) have
recently emerged as a powerful framework for knowledge representation,
synthesis, and compression. By encoding fields as continuous functions within
the weights and biases of deep neural networks-rather than relying on voxel- or
mesh-based structured or unstructured representations-INRs offer both
resolution independence and high memory efficiency. However, their accuracy in
domain-specific applications remains insufficiently understood. In this work,
we assess the performance of state-of-the-art INRs for compressing hemodynamic
fields derived from numerical simulations and for representing cardiovascular
anatomies via signed distance functions. We investigate several strategies to
mitigate spectral bias, including specialized activation functions, both fixed
and trainable positional encoding, and linear combinations of nonlinear
kernels. On realistic, space- and time-varying hemodynamic fields in the
thoracic aorta, INRs achieved remarkable compression ratios of up to
approximately 230, with maximum absolute errors of 1 mmHg for pressure and 5-10
cm/s for velocity, without extensive hyperparameter tuning. Across 48 thoracic
aortic anatomies, the average and maximum absolute anatomical discrepancies
were below 0.5 mm and 1.6 mm, respectively. Overall, the SIREN, MFN-Gabor, and
MHE architectures demonstrated the best performance. Source code and data is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: L2M3OF is the first multimodal LLM for MOF design that integrates crystal structure learning with language understanding, outperforming text-only LLMs in property prediction and knowledge generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with scientific discovery like MOF design because understanding complex physical phenomena requires multimodal representations beyond just language, and MOF design relies heavily on tacit human expertise not captured in text alone.

Method: L2M3OF integrates crystal representation learning with language understanding using a pre-trained crystal encoder with projection layer to compress structural information into token space, aligning it with language instructions. A curated structure-property-knowledge database is used for training.

Result: L2M3OF outperforms state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs (GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, DeepSeek-R1) in property prediction and knowledge generation tasks despite using far fewer parameters.

Conclusion: Multimodal approaches are crucial for porous material understanding, and L2M3OF establishes a foundation for next-generation AI systems in materials discovery.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities
across diverse natural language tasks. However, comparable breakthroughs in
scientific discovery are more limited, because understanding complex physical
phenomena demands multifaceted representations far beyond language alone. A
compelling example is the design of functional materials such as MOFs-critical
for a range of impactful applications like carbon capture and hydrogen storage.
Navigating their vast and intricate design space in language-based
representations interpretable by LLMs is challenging due to the numerous
possible three-dimensional atomic arrangements and strict reticular rules of
coordination geometry and topology. Despite promising early results in
LLM-assisted discovery for simpler materials systems, MOF design remains
heavily reliant on tacit human expertise rarely codified in textual information
alone. To overcome this barrier, we introduce L2M3OF, the first multimodal LLM
for MOFs. L2M3OF integrates crystal representation learning with language
understanding to process structural, textual, and knowledge modalities jointly.
L2M3OF employs a pre-trained crystal encoder with a lightweight projection
layer to compress structural information into a token space, enabling efficient
alignment with language instructions. To facilitate training and evaluation, we
curate a structure-property-knowledge database of crystalline materials and
benchmark L2M3OF against state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs such as GPT-5,
Gemini-2.5-Pro and DeepSeek-R1. Experiments show that L2M3OF outperforms
leading text-based closed-source LLMs in property prediction and knowledge
generation tasks, despite using far fewer parameters. These results highlight
the importance of multimodal approaches for porous material understanding and
establish L2M3OF as a foundation for next-generation AI systems in materials
discovery.

Conclusion: MeDyate represents a significant step towards enabling efficient on-device learning by demonstrating effective fine-tuning with extremely low memory requirements, making it practical for resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: On-device neural network training faces critical memory constraints that
limit the adaptation of pre-trained models to downstream tasks. We present
MeDyate, a theoretically-grounded framework for memory-constrained dynamic

temporal stability of channel importance distributions during fine-tuning.
MeDyate dynamically resamples channels between epochs according to
importance-weighted probabilities, ensuring comprehensive parameter space

*Xi Zhang,Xiaolin Wu,Jiamang Wang,Weisi Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GLVQ is a novel quantization method using learnable lattice codebooks for groups of weights, achieving better size-accuracy trade-offs than standard PTQ methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard uniform quantization causes performance degradation in low-bit scenarios, especially for LLMs that require extensive computational resources.

Method: Grouped Lattice Vector Quantization with learnable generation matrices and Babai rounding for stable training, with efficient matrix-vector multiplication decoding.

Result: Better trade-off between model size and accuracy compared to existing PTQ baselines across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: GLVQ provides an effective solution for deploying large models under resource constraints through efficient lattice-based quantization.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but
typically require extensive computational resources and memory for inference.
Post-training quantization (PTQ) can effectively reduce these demands by
storing weights in lower bit-width formats. However, standard uniform
quantization often leads to notable performance degradation, particularly in
low-bit scenarios. In this work, we introduce a Grouped Lattice Vector
Quantization (GLVQ) framework that assigns each group of weights a customized
lattice codebook, defined by a learnable generation matrix. To address the
non-differentiability of the quantization process, we adopt Babai rounding to
approximate nearest-lattice-point search during training, which enables stable
optimization of the generation matrices. Once trained, decoding reduces to a
simple matrix-vector multiplication, yielding an efficient and practical
quantization pipeline. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that our
approach achieves a better trade-off between model size and accuracy compared
to existing post-training quantization baselines, highlighting its
effectiveness in deploying large models under stringent resource constraints.

TL;DR: Proposes a BiGRU-optimized Transformer model for GPU memory demand prediction in deep learning tasks, showing superior performance over traditional ML methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the critical need for accurate GPU memory resource prediction in deep learning to optimize resource scheduling and improve computing cluster efficiency.

Method: Integrates bidirectional gated recurrent units (BiGRU) to optimize Transformer architecture, and compares against decision tree, random forest, Adaboost, and XGBoost benchmarks.

Result: Achieves lowest MSE and RMSE values, excellent MAE and R2 performance, with comprehensive predictive performance far exceeding benchmark methods.

Conclusion: The BiGRU-optimized Transformer model efficiently and accurately predicts GPU memory demands with significantly improved accuracy over traditional methods, providing strong technical support for resource optimization.

Abstract: In response to the increasingly critical demand for accurate prediction of
GPU memory resources in deep learning tasks, this paper deeply analyzes the
current research status and innovatively proposes a deep learning model that
integrates bidirectional gated recurrent units (BiGRU) to optimize the
Transformer architecture, aiming to improve the accuracy of memory demand
prediction. To verify the effectiveness of the model, a carefully designed
comparative experiment was conducted, selecting four representative basic
machine learning models: decision tree, random forest, Adaboost, and XGBoost as
benchmarks. The detailed experimental results show that the BiGRU Transformer
optimization model proposed in this paper exhibits significant advantages in
key evaluation indicators: in terms of mean square error (MSE) and root mean
square error (RMSE), the model achieves the lowest value among all comparison
models, and its predicted results have the smallest deviation from the actual
values; In terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and coefficient of determination
(R2) indicators, the model also performs well and the results are balanced and
stable, with comprehensive predictive performance far exceeding the benchmark
machine learning methods compared. In summary, the Transformer model based on
bidirectional gated recurrent unit optimization successfully constructed in
this study can efficiently and accurately complete GPU memory demand prediction
tasks in deep learning tasks, and its prediction accuracy has been
significantly improved compared to traditional machine learning methods. This
research provides strong technical support and reliable theoretical basis for
optimizing resource scheduling and management of deep learning tasks, and
improving the utilization efficiency of computing clusters.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for training spiking neural networks (SNNs) using evolutionary optimization for binary classification on multivariate time series, achieving high precision with low false alarm rates and demonstrating applications in radioactive source detection and seizure detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop efficient SNNs for step-wise prediction in time series data with high precision at low false alarm rates, leveraging the energy efficiency and biological plausibility of neuromorphic computing.

Method: Uses Evolutionary Optimization of Neuromorphic Systems (EONS) algorithm to evolve sparse, stateful SNNs by jointly optimizing architectures and parameters. Inputs are encoded into spike trains, and predictions are made by thresholding output neuron spike counts. Incorporates voting ensemble methods for improved performance.

Result: For radioactive source detection: SNNs with 49 neurons and 66 synapses achieved 51.8% TPR at 1/hr false alarm rate, outperforming PCA (42.7%) and deep learning (49.8%). A three-model ensemble increased TPR to 67.1%. Hardware deployment showed 2mW power and 20.2ms latency. For seizure detection: ensemble achieved 95% TPR with 16% false positive rate, comparable to deep learning with reduced parameters.

Conclusion: The framework successfully trains compact, efficient SNNs for time series classification, demonstrating competitive performance with significantly reduced computational requirements and power consumption, making it suitable for edge deployment in various applications.

Abstract: We present a general framework for training spiking neural networks (SNNs) to
perform binary classification on multivariate time series, with a focus on
step-wise prediction and high precision at low false alarm rates. The approach
uses the Evolutionary Optimization of Neuromorphic Systems (EONS) algorithm to
evolve sparse, stateful SNNs by jointly optimizing their architectures and
parameters. Inputs are encoded into spike trains, and predictions are made by
thresholding a single output neuron's spike counts. We also incorporate simple
voting ensemble methods to improve performance and robustness.
  To evaluate the framework, we apply it with application-specific
optimizations to the task of detecting low signal-to-noise ratio radioactive
sources in gamma-ray spectral data. The resulting SNNs, with as few as 49
neurons and 66 synapses, achieve a 51.8% true positive rate (TPR) at a false
alarm rate of 1/hr, outperforming PCA (42.7%) and deep learning (49.8%)
baselines. A three-model any-vote ensemble increases TPR to 67.1% at the same
false alarm rate. Hardware deployment on the microCaspian neuromorphic platform
demonstrates 2mW power consumption and 20.2ms inference latency.
  We also demonstrate generalizability by applying the same framework, without
domain-specific modification, to seizure detection in EEG recordings. An
ensemble achieves 95% TPR with a 16% false positive rate, comparable to recent
deep learning approaches with significant reduction in parameter count.

*Enshu Liu,Qian Chen,Xuefei Ning,Shengen Yan,Guohao Dai,Zinan Lin,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DD2 enables one-step sampling for image AR models with minimal performance degradation, improving upon DD1 by eliminating pre-defined mapping and using conditional score distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image AR models suffer from slow generation speed due to many sampling steps. DD1 had limitations in one-step performance and inflexible pre-defined mapping.

Method: Views AR model as teacher providing conditional scores in latent space. Uses conditional score distillation loss to train one-step generator that predicts conditional scores at each token position.

Result: DD2 achieves one-step sampling with FID increase from 3.40 to 5.43 on ImageNet-256, reducing gap between one-step and original AR by 67% vs DD1, with 12.3x training speed-up.

Conclusion: DD2 significantly advances one-step AR generation, enabling fast and high-quality AR modeling.

Abstract: Image Auto-regressive (AR) models have emerged as a powerful paradigm of
visual generative models. Despite their promising performance, they suffer from
slow generation speed due to the large number of sampling steps required.
Although Distilled Decoding 1 (DD1) was recently proposed to enable few-step
sampling for image AR models, it still incurs significant performance
degradation in the one-step setting, and relies on a pre-defined mapping that
limits its flexibility. In this work, we propose a new method, Distilled
Decoding 2 (DD2), to further advances the feasibility of one-step sampling for
image AR models. Unlike DD1, DD2 does not without rely on a pre-defined
mapping. We view the original AR model as a teacher model which provides the
ground truth conditional score in the latent embedding space at each token
position. Based on this, we propose a novel \emph{conditional score
distillation loss} to train a one-step generator. Specifically, we train a
separate network to predict the conditional score of the generated distribution
and apply score distillation at every token position conditioned on previous
tokens. Experimental results show that DD2 enables one-step sampling for image
AR models with an minimal FID increase from 3.40 to 5.43 on ImageNet-256.
Compared to the strongest baseline DD1, DD2 reduces the gap between the
one-step sampling and original AR model by 67%, with up to 12.3$\times$
training speed-up simultaneously. DD2 takes a significant step toward the goal
of one-step AR generation, opening up new possibilities for fast and
high-quality AR modeling. Code is available at

Motivation: To ensure fairness guarantees in representation learning and prevent unfairness toward specific demographic groups in downstream tasks, with formal guarantees.

Method: Proposed FRG framework that uses an optimized adversarial model to provide high-confidence fairness guarantees by bounding demographic disparity.

Result: FRG consistently bounds unfairness across various downstream models and tasks on three real-world datasets, outperforming six state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The FRG framework successfully provides formal high-confidence fairness guarantees for representation learning, ensuring bounded demographic disparity in downstream predictions.

Abstract: Representation learning is increasingly applied to generate representations
that generalize well across multiple downstream tasks. Ensuring fairness
guarantees in representation learning is crucial to prevent unfairness toward
specific demographic groups in downstream tasks. In this work, we formally
introduce the task of learning representations that achieve high-confidence
fairness. We aim to guarantee that demographic disparity in every downstream
prediction remains bounded by a *user-defined* error threshold $\epsilon$, with
*controllable* high probability. To this end, we propose the ***F**air
**R**epresentation learning with high-confidence **G**uarantees (FRG)*
framework, which provides these high-confidence fairness guarantees by
leveraging an optimized adversarial model. We empirically evaluate FRG on three
real-world datasets, comparing its performance to six state-of-the-art fair
representation learning methods. Our results demonstrate that FRG consistently
bounds unfairness across a range of downstream models and tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZO optimization improves stability in continual learning by creating flatter loss landscapes that reduce forgetting, but reduces plasticity for learning new tasks. The proposed ZO-FC method combines ZO optimization for adapters with FO optimization for classifiers to balance stability and plasticity efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the plasticity-stability-efficiency trilemma in continual learning using zeroth-order optimization as a memory-efficient alternative to first-order methods, particularly for on-device applications.

Method: Proposes ZO-FC approach that applies ZO optimization to adapter-based PEFT modules while using FO optimization for classifiers, combining stability benefits of ZO with adaptability of FO updates.

Result: ZO optimization naturally leads to flatter loss landscapes that reduce forgetting but impairs plasticity for new task learning. ZO-FC achieves effective balance between stability and plasticity with negligible memory overhead.

Conclusion: ZO-FC offers a practical and memory-efficient solution for on-device continual learning by strategically combining ZO and FO optimization to address the stability-plasticity trade-off.

Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization has gained attention as a memory-efficient
alternative to first-order (FO) methods, particularly in settings where
gradient computation is expensive or even impractical. Beyond its memory
efficiency, in this work, we investigate ZO optimization for continual learning
(CL) as a novel approach to address the plasticity-stability-efficiency
trilemma. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evidence, we show that ZO
optimization naturally leads to flatter loss landscapes, which in turn reduce
forgetting in CL. However, this stability comes at a cost of plasticity: due to
its imprecise gradient estimates and slower convergence, ZO optimization tends
to be less effective than FO in acquiring new task-specific knowledge,
particularly under constrained training budgets. To better understand this
trade-off, we conduct a holistic evaluation of ZO optimization applied to
various existing CL methods. Our findings reveal that ZO optimization enhances
stability but often undermines plasticity, particularly when used with
learnable classifiers. Motivated by this insight, we propose ZO-FC, a simple
but effective approach that applies ZO optimization to a single adapter-based
PEFT module with FO optimized classifier. This design leverages the stability
benefits of ZO while preserving the adaptability of FO updates with negligible
memory overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ZO-FC achieves an effective
balance between stability and plasticity, offering a practical and
memory-efficient solution for on-device CL.

*Konstantinos Christopher Tsiolis,Alireza Mousavi-Hosseini,Murat A. Erdogdu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how learning rates affect sample complexity in gradient-based learning of Gaussian single-index models, showing a phase transition between information exponent and generative exponent regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the relationship between learning rates and sample complexity in neural network feature learning, particularly how different learning rate choices can shift algorithms between correlational and non-correlational update regimes.

Method: The authors develop a theoretical framework covering various gradient-based algorithms including one-pass SGD, SGD with batch reuse, and introduce a new layer-wise training algorithm using different learning rates for each layer (two-timescales approach).

Result: The study reveals a phase transition phenomenon where small learning rates lead to information exponent regime while large learning rates lead to generative exponent regime, with the latter potentially achieving much smaller sample complexity.

Conclusion: The choice of learning rate is as crucial as algorithm design for achieving statistical and computational efficiency in neural network training, with the framework providing insights into when different learning rate strategies are optimal.

Abstract: To understand feature learning dynamics in neural networks, recent
theoretical works have focused on gradient-based learning of Gaussian
single-index models, where the label is a nonlinear function of a latent
one-dimensional projection of the input. While the sample complexity of online
SGD is determined by the information exponent of the link function, recent
works improved this by performing multiple gradient steps on the same sample
with different learning rates -- yielding a non-correlational update rule --
and instead are limited by the (potentially much smaller) generative exponent.
However, this picture is only valid when these learning rates are sufficiently
large. In this paper, we characterize the relationship between learning rate(s)
and sample complexity for a broad class of gradient-based algorithms that
encapsulates both correlational and non-correlational updates. We demonstrate
that, in certain cases, there is a phase transition from an "information
exponent regime" with small learning rate to a "generative exponent regime"
with large learning rate. Our framework covers prior analyses of one-pass SGD
and SGD with batch reuse, while also introducing a new layer-wise training
algorithm that leverages a two-timescales approach (via different learning
rates for each layer) to go beyond correlational queries without reusing
samples or modifying the loss from squared error. Our theoretical study
demonstrates that the choice of learning rate is as important as the design of
the algorithm in achieving statistical and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Labeling or classifying time series is a persistent challenge in the physical
sciences, where expert annotations are scarce, costly, and often inconsistent.
Yet robust labeling is essential to enable machine learning models for

physics. CIPHER integrates \textit{indexable Symbolic Aggregate approXimation}
(iSAX) for interpretable compression and indexing, density-based clustering
(HDBSCAN) to group recurring phenomena, and a human-in-the-loop step for
efficient expert validation. Representative samples are labeled by domain
scientists, and these annotations are propagated across clusters to yield
systematic, scalable classifications. We evaluate CIPHER on the task of
classifying solar wind phenomena in OMNI data, a central challenge in space
weather research, showing that the framework recovers meaningful phenomena such
as coronal mass ejections and stream interaction regions. Beyond this case
study, CIPHER highlights a general strategy for combining symbolic

*Qingsong Xu,Jonathan L Bamber,Nils Thuerey,Niklas Boers,Paul Bates,Gustau Camps-Valls,Yilei Shi,Xiao Xiang Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Physics-consistent neural operator (PCNO) with diffusion model enhancement for accurate, uncertainty-aware spatiotemporal forecasting while enforcing physical laws.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ML methods neglect physical laws and fail to quantify uncertainties in spatiotemporal predictions, limiting their reliability in scientific applications.

Method: Two-stage framework: PCNO enforces physical constraints via projection layers in Fourier space, and DiffPCNO adds consistency model for uncertainty quantification.

Result: Achieves high-fidelity predictions while preserving physical consistency and uncertainty across diverse systems including turbulent flow, flood, and atmospheric forecasting.

Conclusion: Provides robust and versatile approach for accurate, physically grounded, and uncertainty-aware spatiotemporal forecasting.

Abstract: Accurate long-term forecasting of spatiotemporal dynamics remains a
fundamental challenge across scientific and engineering domains. Existing
machine learning methods often neglect governing physical laws and fail to
quantify inherent uncertainties in spatiotemporal predictions. To address these
challenges, we introduce a physics-consistent neural operator (PCNO) that
enforces physical constraints by projecting surrogate model outputs onto
function spaces satisfying predefined laws. A physics-consistent projection
layer within PCNO efficiently computes mass and momentum conservation in
Fourier space. Building upon deterministic predictions, we further propose a
diffusion model-enhanced PCNO (DiffPCNO), which leverages a consistency model
to quantify and mitigate uncertainties, thereby improving the accuracy and
reliability of forecasts. PCNO and DiffPCNO achieve high-fidelity
spatiotemporal predictions while preserving physical consistency and
uncertainty across diverse systems and spatial resolutions, ranging from
turbulent flow modeling to real-world flood/atmospheric forecasting. Our
two-stage framework provides a robust and versatile approach for accurate,
physically grounded, and uncertainty-aware spatiotemporal forecasting.

*Gereon Elvers,Gilad Landau,Oiwi Parker Jones*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Keyword Spotting (KWS) as a practical intermediate task for non-invasive BCIs, using the LibriBrain corpus with standardized splits and robust evaluation metrics like AUPRC and FA/h.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current BCI benchmarks focus on simple tasks, while application-ready results like Brain-to-Text remain elusive. KWS is proposed as a privacy-aware, practically applicable intermediate task.

Method: Uses the 52-hour LibriBrain corpus with standardized train/validation/test splits. Implements a 1-D Conv/ResNet baseline with focal loss and top-k pooling, trainable on consumer GPUs. Uses AUPRC and FA/h metrics for evaluation.

Result: The reference model achieves ~13x the permutation baseline AUPRC on held-out sessions. Shows predictable within-subject scaling (log-linear improvement with more training) and word-level factors (frequency, duration) that modulate detectability.

Conclusion: KWS is a viable intermediate BCI task with practical applications. The approach demonstrates predictable scaling and systematic word-level effects, providing a foundation for further research.

Abstract: Non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are beginning to benefit from
large, public benchmarks. However, current benchmarks target relatively simple,
foundational tasks like Speech Detection and Phoneme Classification, while
application-ready results on tasks like Brain-to-Text remain elusive. We
propose Keyword Spotting (KWS) as a practically applicable, privacy-aware
intermediate task. Using the deep 52-hour, within-subject LibriBrain corpus, we
provide standardized train/validation/test splits for reproducible
benchmarking, and adopt an evaluation protocol tailored to extreme class
imbalance. Concretely, we use area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) as
a robust evaluation metric, complemented by false alarms per hour (FA/h) at
fixed recall to capture user-facing trade-offs. To simplify deployment and
further experimentation within the research community, we are releasing an
updated version of the pnpl library with word-level dataloaders and Colab-ready
tutorials. As an initial reference model, we present a compact 1-D Conv/ResNet
baseline with focal loss and top-k pooling that is trainable on a single
consumer-class GPU. The reference model achieves approximately 13x the
permutation baseline AUPRC on held-out sessions, demonstrating the viability of
the task. Exploratory analyses reveal: (i) predictable within-subject scaling -
performance improves log-linearly with more training hours - and (ii) the
existence of word-level factors (frequency and duration) that systematically
modulate detectability.

*Daniel M. Steinberg,Asiri Wijesinghe,Rafael Oliveira,Piotr Koniusz,Cheng Soon Ong,Edwin V. Bonilla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A-GPS is a framework for online discrete black-box multi-objective optimization that learns a generative model of Pareto sets, supports user preference conditioning, and avoids explicit hypervolume computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for efficient multi-objective optimization that can incorporate user preferences and generate high-quality Pareto set approximations without retraining.

Method: Uses a generative model conditioned on non-dominance relations predicted by a class probability estimator, incorporates preference direction vectors for user-specified trade-offs, and updates the model using Pareto membership and preference alignment.

Result: Achieves strong sample efficiency and effective preference incorporation on synthetic benchmarks and protein design tasks, producing high-quality Pareto set approximations.

Conclusion: A-GPS provides a simple yet powerful approach for multi-objective optimization that flexibly captures user preferences and avoids explicit hypervolume computation while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: We introduce active generation of Pareto sets (A-GPS), a new framework for
online discrete black-box multi-objective optimization (MOO). A-GPS learns a
generative model of the Pareto set that supports a-posteriori conditioning on
user preferences. The method employs a class probability estimator (CPE) to
predict non-dominance relations and to condition the generative model toward
high-performing regions of the search space. We also show that this
non-dominance CPE implicitly estimates the probability of hypervolume
improvement (PHVI). To incorporate subjective trade-offs, A-GPS introduces
preference direction vectors that encode user-specified preferences in
objective space. At each iteration, the model is updated using both Pareto
membership and alignment with these preference directions, producing an
amortized generative model capable of sampling across the Pareto front without
retraining. The result is a simple yet powerful approach that achieves
high-quality Pareto set approximations, avoids explicit hypervolume
computation, and flexibly captures user preferences. Empirical results on
synthetic benchmarks and protein design tasks demonstrate strong sample
efficiency and effective preference incorporation.

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel online multi-class selection algorithm with group fairness guarantees, featuring a lossless rounding scheme and addressing multi-class membership challenges through a relax-and-round framework with resource reservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing literature: lack of lossless rounding schemes that preserve performance, and challenges with agents belonging to multiple classes in online resource allocation.

Method: A randomized algorithm using relax-and-round framework with resource reservation (set-aside mechanism) for fairness, plus a learning-augmented variant incorporating machine-learned predictions.

Result: Developed a rounding scheme that ensures integral algorithm achieves same expected performance as fractional solutions while preserving fairness guarantees across classes.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses multi-class fairness challenges in online resource allocation with performance-preserving rounding and practical learning-augmented variants.

Abstract: We study the online multi-class selection problem with group fairness
guarantees, where limited resources must be allocated to sequentially arriving
agents. Our work addresses two key limitations in the existing literature.
First, we introduce a novel lossless rounding scheme that ensures the integral
algorithm achieves the same expected performance as any fractional solution.
Second, we explicitly address the challenges introduced by agents who belong to
multiple classes. To this end, we develop a randomized algorithm based on a
relax-and-round framework. The algorithm first computes a fractional solution
using a resource reservation approach -- referred to as the set-aside mechanism
-- to enforce fairness across classes. The subsequent rounding step preserves
these fairness guarantees without degrading performance. Additionally, we
propose a learning-augmented variant that incorporates untrusted
machine-learned predictions to better balance fairness and efficiency in
practical settings.

TL;DR: This paper provides a theoretical analysis of differentially private policy optimization in reinforcement learning, focusing on sample complexity under privacy constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Policy optimization is widely used in sensitive domains like healthcare and robotics, raising privacy concerns that need to be addressed through formal privacy guarantees.

Method: The authors formalize a tailored definition of differential privacy for policy optimization and systematically analyze sample complexity of algorithms like policy gradient and natural policy gradient under DP constraints using a unified framework.

Result: Theoretical results show that privacy costs often appear as lower-order terms in sample complexity, with important observations about private policy optimization settings.

Conclusion: The study provides valuable practical insights for developing privacy-preserving policy optimization algorithms in reinforcement learning applications.

Abstract: Policy optimization (PO) is a cornerstone of modern reinforcement learning
(RL), with diverse applications spanning robotics, healthcare, and large
language model training. The increasing deployment of PO in sensitive domains,
however, raises significant privacy concerns. In this paper, we initiate a
theoretical study of differentially private policy optimization, focusing
explicitly on its sample complexity. We first formalize an appropriate
definition of differential privacy (DP) tailored to PO, addressing the inherent
challenges arising from on-policy learning dynamics and the subtlety involved
in defining the unit of privacy. We then systematically analyze the sample
complexity of widely-used PO algorithms, including policy gradient (PG),
natural policy gradient (NPG) and more, under DP constraints and various
settings, via a unified framework. Our theoretical results demonstrate that
privacy costs can often manifest as lower-order terms in the sample complexity,
while also highlighting subtle yet important observations in private PO
settings. These offer valuable practical insights for privacy-preserving PO
algorithms.

*Raul Cavalcante Dinardi,Bruno Yamamoto,Anna Helena Reali Costa,Artur Jordao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Selecting the shortest solution from multiple LLM outputs is an effective heuristic that performs competitively with complex methods like self-consistency while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods for improving LLM reasoning through parallel test-time compute require complex scoring mechanisms that increase computational cost and complexity. There's a need for simpler, more efficient approaches.

Method: Proposes using the simple heuristic of selecting the shortest solution from multiple LLM outputs, based on the observation that models operate in two regimes: concise confident reasoning and verbose uncertain overthinking.

Result: The shortest-answer heuristic performs competitively with self-consistency across two challenging benchmarks while significantly reducing computational overhead. It provides a Pareto improvement over self-consistency.

Conclusion: The simple heuristic of selecting the shortest answer is highly effective for improving LLM reasoning performance, offering computational efficiency while maintaining competitive accuracy, and applies even to tasks where output equality is not well-defined.

Abstract: Reasoning models represent a significant advance in LLM capabilities,
particularly for complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding.
Previous studies confirm that parallel test-time compute-sampling multiple
solutions and selecting the best one-can further enhance the predictive
performance of LLMs. However, strategies in this area often require complex
scoring, thus increasing computational cost and complexity. In this work, we
demonstrate that the simple and counterintuitive heuristic of selecting the
shortest solution is highly effective. We posit that the observed effectiveness
stems from models operating in two distinct regimes: a concise, confident
conventional regime and a verbose overthinking regime characterized by
uncertainty, and we show evidence of a critical point where the overthinking
regime begins to be significant. By selecting the shortest answer, the
heuristic preferentially samples from the conventional regime. We confirm that
this approach is competitive with more complex methods such as self-consistency
across two challenging benchmarks while significantly reducing computational
overhead. The shortest-answer heuristic provides a Pareto improvement over
self-consistency and applies even to tasks where output equality is not well
defined.

*Hancheng Min,Zhihui Zhu,René Vidal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proves that gradient flow on two-layer ReLU networks for orthogonally separable data exhibits Neural Collapse (NC), advancing prior work by incorporating data structure, nonlinear activations, and implicit bias effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the theoretical foundations of Neural Collapse phenomenon in deep networks, particularly by moving beyond unconstrained feature assumptions and incorporating the effects of data structure and training dynamics.

Method: Theoretical analysis of gradient flow on two-layer ReLU networks trained on orthogonally separable data, examining how training dynamics and network architecture lead to Neural Collapse.

Result: Proves that Neural Collapse provably emerges in this setting, demonstrating that the phenomenon occurs even with constrained features and nonlinear activations, and is facilitated by the implicit bias of gradient flow.

Conclusion: Neural Collapse is a fundamental property that emerges from the interaction between network architecture, data structure, and training dynamics, not just from unconstrained optimization of features.

Abstract: Among many mysteries behind the success of deep networks lies the exceptional
discriminative power of their learned representations as manifested by the
intriguing Neural Collapse (NC) phenomenon, where simple feature structures
emerge at the last layer of a trained neural network. Prior works on the
theoretical understandings of NC have focused on analyzing the optimization
landscape of matrix-factorization-like problems by considering the last-layer
features as unconstrained free optimization variables and showing that their
global minima exhibit NC. In this paper, we show that gradient flow on a
two-layer ReLU network for classifying orthogonally separable data provably
exhibits NC, thereby advancing prior results in two ways: First, we relax the
assumption of unconstrained features, showing the effect of data structure and
nonlinear activations on NC characterizations. Second, we reveal the role of
the implicit bias of the training dynamics in facilitating the emergence of NC.

*Zhuojin Li,Marco Paolieri,Leana Golubchik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for collaborative CPU-GPU execution on mobile devices using lightweight synchronization and ML-based execution time prediction to reduce neural network inference latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile devices have limited computing resources but unified memory architecture and narrowing CPU-GPU performance gap create opportunities for collaborative execution to reduce inference latency.

Method: Proposes lightweight synchronization using OpenCL fine-grained shared virtual memory (SVM) and machine learning models to predict execution times of tasks on CPU and GPU, including GPU kernel dispatch times.

Result: Achieves up to 1.89x speedup for linear layers and 1.75x speedup for convolutional layers on mobile platforms, approaching theoretical maximums of 2.01x and 1.87x respectively.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enables CPU-GPU co-execution on mobile devices by overcoming synchronization overhead and execution time prediction challenges, significantly improving neural network inference performance.

Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks on mobile devices is increasingly important
but remains challenging due to limited computing resources. On the other hand,
their unified memory architecture and narrower gap between CPU and GPU
performance provide an opportunity to reduce inference latency by assigning
tasks to both CPU and GPU. The main obstacles for such collaborative execution
are the significant synchronization overhead required to combine partial
results, and the difficulty of predicting execution times of tasks assigned to
CPU and GPU (due to the dynamic selection of implementations and parallelism
level). To overcome these obstacles, we propose both a lightweight
synchronization mechanism based on OpenCL fine-grained shared virtual memory
(SVM) and machine learning models to accurately predict execution times.
Notably, these models capture the performance characteristics of GPU kernels
and account for their dispatch times. A comprehensive evaluation on four mobile
platforms shows that our approach can quickly select CPU-GPU co-execution
strategies achieving up to 1.89x speedup for linear layers and 1.75x speedup
for convolutional layers (close to the achievable maximum values of 2.01x and
1.87x, respectively, found by exhaustive grid search on a Pixel~5 smartphone).

*Jiaqi Xue,Mayank Kumar,Yuzhang Shang,Shangqian Gao,Rui Ning,Mengxin Zheng,Xiaoqian Jiang,Qian Lou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DictPFL is a federated learning framework that achieves full gradient protection with minimal overhead by decomposing model weights into static dictionaries and encrypted lookup tables, reducing communication costs by 402-748× while maintaining privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HE-based FL methods either encrypt all gradients with high computational overhead or partially encrypt gradients while exposing vulnerabilities. There's a need for practical privacy-preserving FL that balances security and efficiency.

Method: DictPFL uses two key modules: DePE decomposes model weights into static dictionaries (kept local) and updatable lookup tables (encrypted and aggregated), and PrME applies encryption-aware pruning with history-guided masks to minimize encrypted parameters.

Result: DictPFL reduces communication cost by 402-748× and accelerates training by 28-65× compared to fully encrypted FL, outperforming state-of-the-art selective encryption methods by 51-155× in overhead and 4-19× in speed. Runtime is within 2× of plaintext FL.

Conclusion: DictPFL demonstrates that HE-based private federated learning is practical for real-world deployment, achieving full gradient protection with minimal overhead comparable to plaintext FL.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
institutions without sharing raw data. However, gradient sharing still risks
privacy leakage, such as gradient inversion attacks. Homomorphic Encryption
(HE) can secure aggregation but often incurs prohibitive computational and
communication overhead. Existing HE-based FL methods sit at two extremes:
encrypting all gradients for full privacy at high cost, or partially encrypting
gradients to save resources while exposing vulnerabilities. We present DictPFL,
a practical framework that achieves full gradient protection with minimal
overhead. DictPFL encrypts every transmitted gradient while keeping
non-transmitted parameters local, preserving privacy without heavy computation.
It introduces two key modules: Decompose-for-Partial-Encrypt (DePE), which
decomposes model weights into a static dictionary and an updatable lookup
table, only the latter is encrypted and aggregated, while the static dictionary
remains local and requires neither sharing nor encryption; and
Prune-for-Minimum-Encrypt (PrME), which applies encryption-aware pruning to
minimize encrypted parameters via consistent, history-guided masks. Experiments
show that DictPFL reduces communication cost by 402-748$\times$ and accelerates
training by 28-65$\times$ compared to fully encrypted FL, while outperforming
state-of-the-art selective encryption methods by 51-155$\times$ in overhead and
4-19$\times$ in speed. Remarkably, DictPFL's runtime is within 2$\times$ of
plaintext FL, demonstrating for the first time, that HE-based private federated
learning is practical for real-world deployment. The code is publicly available

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a motif-driven global-local context graph for few-shot molecular property prediction, using motif nodes to enrich contextual information at both global and local levels, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional deep learning for molecular property prediction requires large labeled datasets, which are often unavailable. Few-shot approaches exist but offer limited structural guidance through basic molecule-property graphs.

Method: Creates a tri-partite heterogeneous graph with motif, molecule, and property nodes at global level. At local level, builds subgraphs for each node pair and encodes them separately to focus on most informative neighbors.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five standard FSMPP benchmarks, demonstrating consistent performance improvements.

Conclusion: Integrating global motif knowledge with fine-grained local context effectively advances robust few-shot molecular property prediction.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction (MPP) is a cornerstone of drug discovery and
materials science, yet conventional deep learning approaches depend on large
labeled datasets that are often unavailable. Few-shot Molecular property
prediction (FSMPP) addresses this scarcity by incorporating relational
inductive bias through a context graph that links molecule nodes to property
nodes, but such molecule-property graphs offer limited structural guidance. We
propose a comprehensive solution: Motif Driven Global-Local Context Graph for
few-shot molecular property prediction, which enriches contextual information
at both the global and local levels. At the global level, chemically meaningful
motif nodes representing shared substructures, such as rings or functional
groups, are introduced to form a global tri-partite heterogeneous graph,
yielding motif-molecule-property connections that capture long-range
compositional patterns and enable knowledge transfer among molecules with
common motifs. At the local level, we build a subgraph for each node in the
molecule-property pair and encode them separately to concentrate the model's
attention on the most informative neighboring molecules and motifs. Experiments
on five standard FSMPP benchmarks demonstrate that our framework consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. These results underscore the
effectiveness of integrating global motif knowledge with fine-grained local
context to advance robust few-shot molecular property prediction.

TL;DR: ESCORT is a particle-based framework that accurately captures complex, multi-modal belief distributions in POMDPs using Stein variational gradient descent with correlation-aware projections and temporal consistency constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard POMDP belief approximation methods fail to represent complex uncertainty structures like high-dimensional, multi-modal distributions, leading to estimation errors and suboptimal agent behaviors.

Method: ESCORT extends SVGD with correlation-aware projections to model state dimension dependencies and temporal consistency constraints to stabilize updates while preserving correlation structures.

Result: ESCORT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in belief approximation accuracy and downstream decision quality across POMDP domains and synthetic multi-modal distributions.

Conclusion: ESCORT provides an effective solution for maintaining representational accuracy in complex belief spaces without resampling or restrictive distributional assumptions.

Abstract: In Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), maintaining and
updating belief distributions over possible underlying states provides a
principled way to summarize action-observation history for effective
decision-making under uncertainty. As environments grow more realistic, belief
distributions develop complexity that standard mathematical models cannot
accurately capture, creating a fundamental challenge in maintaining
representational accuracy. Despite advances in deep learning and probabilistic
modeling, existing POMDP belief approximation methods fail to accurately
represent complex uncertainty structures such as high-dimensional, multi-modal
belief distributions, resulting in estimation errors that lead to suboptimal
agent behaviors. To address this challenge, we present ESCORT (Efficient
Stein-variational and sliced Consistency-Optimized Representation for Temporal
beliefs), a particle-based framework for capturing complex, multi-modal
distributions in high-dimensional belief spaces. ESCORT extends SVGD with two
key innovations: correlation-aware projections that model dependencies between
state dimensions, and temporal consistency constraints that stabilize updates
while preserving correlation structures. This approach retains SVGD's
attractive-repulsive particle dynamics while enabling accurate modeling of
intricate correlation patterns. Unlike particle filters prone to degeneracy or
parametric methods with fixed representational capacity, ESCORT dynamically
adapts to belief landscape complexity without resampling or restrictive
distributional assumptions. We demonstrate ESCORT's effectiveness through
extensive evaluations on both POMDP domains and synthetic multi-modal
distributions of varying dimensionality, where it consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of belief approximation accuracy and
downstream decision quality.

TL;DR: A method for selecting limited features to train models that perform well across multiple subpopulations, using continuous relaxation and noising mechanism without backpropagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature collection is costly in settings like surveys or sensor deployment, and selected features need to support high-quality models for different populations.

Method: Frames feature selection as continuous relaxation using noising mechanism, optimizes over variance of Bayes-optimal predictor without backpropagation through training.

Result: Developed model-agnostic framework that balances downstream prediction performance across populations, validated on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Proposed approach effectively selects features for cross-population model performance while addressing cost constraints in feature collection.

Abstract: We study the problem of selecting limited features to observe such that
models trained on them can perform well simultaneously across multiple
subpopulations. This problem has applications in settings where collecting each
feature is costly, e.g. requiring adding survey questions or physical sensors,
and we must be able to use the selected features to create high-quality
downstream models for different populations. Our method frames the problem as a
continuous relaxation of traditional variable selection using a noising
mechanism, without requiring backpropagation through model training processes.
By optimizing over the variance of a Bayes-optimal predictor, we develop a
model-agnostic framework that balances overall performance of downstream
prediction across populations. We validate our approach through experiments on
both synthetic datasets and real-world data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing centralized photovoltaic (CPV) methods cannot be effectively applied to DPV systems due to challenges such as missing grid-level data, temporal capacity shifts, geographic variability, and panel diversity.

Method: Models aggregated power output as a composite of output from small grids, where each grid output is modeled using a unit output function multiplied by its capacity. Uses efficient algorithms over upper-bound approximation to overcome computational bottlenecks.

Result: Demonstrated superiority through theoretical analysis and experiments. Successfully deployed across various cities in China, significantly reducing potential losses and providing valuable grid operation insights.

Conclusion: SolarBoost effectively addresses DPV forecasting challenges by decoupling homogeneous unit output functions from dynamic capacity, enabling accurate prediction and practical deployment benefits.

Abstract: This paper presents SolarBoost, a novel approach for forecasting power output
in distributed photovoltaic (DPV) systems. While existing centralized
photovoltaic (CPV) methods are able to precisely model output dependencies due
to uniformity, it is difficult to apply such techniques to DPV systems, as DPVs
face challenges such as missing grid-level data, temporal shifts in installed
capacity, geographic variability, and panel diversity. SolarBoost overcomes
these challenges by modeling aggregated power output as a composite of output
from small grids, where each grid output is modeled using a unit output
function multiplied by its capacity. This approach decouples the homogeneous
unit output function from dynamic capacity for accurate prediction. Efficient
algorithms over an upper-bound approximation are proposed to overcome
computational bottlenecks in loss functions. We demonstrate the superiority of
grid-level modeling via theoretical analysis and experiments. SolarBoost has
been validated through deployment across various cities in China, significantly
reducing potential losses and provides valuable insights for the operation of
power grids. The code for this work is available at

Conclusion: The framework effectively handles complex, large-scale MIoT scheduling scenarios by learning hierarchical scheduling strategies that minimize workflow makespan.

Abstract: The Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) demands stringent end-to-end latency
guarantees for sequential healthcare workflows deployed over heterogeneous
cloud-fog-edge infrastructures. Scheduling these sequential workflows to
minimize makespan is an NP-hard problem. To tackle this challenge, we propose a
Two-tier DDPG-based scheduling framework that decomposes the scheduling
decision into a hierarchical process: a global controller performs layer
selection (edge, fog, or cloud), while specialized local controllers handle
node assignment within the chosen layer. The primary optimization objective is
the minimization of the workflow makespan. Experiments results validate our
approach, demonstrating increasingly superior performance over baselines as
workflow complexity rises. This trend highlights the frameworks ability to
learn effective long-term strategies, which is critical for complex,
large-scale MIoT scheduling scenarios.

*Lianghong Chen,Dongkyu Eugene Kim,Mike Domaratzki,Pingzhao Hu*

TL;DR: An uncertainty-aware RL framework that guides 3D molecular diffusion models to optimize multiple property objectives while improving molecular quality, outperforming baselines and showing promising drug-like behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models struggle to effectively control complex multi-objective constraints critical for real-world drug discovery and molecular engineering applications.

Method: Uncertainty-aware Reinforcement Learning framework with surrogate models using predictive uncertainty estimation to dynamically shape reward functions and balance multiple optimization objectives.

Result: Consistently outperformed baselines across three benchmark datasets and multiple diffusion model architectures for molecular quality and property optimization. MD simulations and ADMET profiling showed promising drug-like behavior and binding stability comparable to known EGFR inhibitors.

Conclusion: The RL-guided generative diffusion models demonstrate strong potential for advancing automated molecular design in drug discovery applications.

Abstract: Designing de novo 3D molecules with desirable properties remains a
fundamental challenge in drug discovery and molecular engineering. While
diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality 3D molecular structures, they often struggle to effectively
control complex multi-objective constraints critical for real-world
applications. In this study, we propose an uncertainty-aware Reinforcement
Learning (RL) framework to guide the optimization of 3D molecular diffusion
models toward multiple property objectives while enhancing the overall quality
of the generated molecules. Our method leverages surrogate models with
predictive uncertainty estimation to dynamically shape reward functions,
facilitating balance across multiple optimization objectives. We
comprehensively evaluate our framework across three benchmark datasets and
multiple diffusion model architectures, consistently outperforming baselines
for molecular quality and property optimization. Additionally, Molecular
Dynamics (MD) simulations and ADMET profiling of top generated candidates
indicate promising drug-like behavior and binding stability, comparable to
known Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) inhibitors. Our results
demonstrate the strong potential of RL-guided generative diffusion models for
advancing automated molecular design.

### [167] [A Unified Matrix Factorization Framework for Classical and Robust Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21172)
*Angshul Majumdar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a unified matrix factorization framework for both classical and robust clustering, establishing equivalence between k-means/fuzzy c-means and matrix factorization, and developing robust variants using l1,2-norm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified framework that bridges classical clustering methods (k-means and fuzzy c-means) with matrix factorization, enabling principled extensions to robust clustering that are less sensitive to outliers.

Method: Reformulate crisp k-means and fuzzy c-means clustering as matrix factorization problems, then develop robust variants by replacing Frobenius norm with l1,2-norm. Use alternating minimization for standard formulations and IRLS-based algorithms for robust counterparts.

Result: Successfully derived matrix factorization interpretations for both clustering paradigms, developed convergent algorithms for all variants, and created robust clustering methods that are less affected by outliers.

Conclusion: The proposed unified framework successfully connects classical clustering with matrix factorization and enables robust extensions, with all algorithms proven to converge to local minima, providing a principled approach to robust clustering.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified matrix factorization framework for classical
and robust clustering. We begin by revisiting the well-known equivalence
between crisp k-means clustering and matrix factorization, following and
rigorously rederiving an unpublished formulation by Bauckhage. Extending this
framework, we derive an analogous matrix factorization interpretation for fuzzy
c-means clustering, which to the best of our knowledge has not been previously
formalized. These reformulations allow both clustering paradigms to be
expressed as optimization problems over factor matrices, thereby enabling
principled extensions to robust variants. To address sensitivity to outliers,
we propose robust formulations for both crisp and fuzzy clustering by replacing
the Frobenius norm with the l1,2-norm, which penalizes the sum of Euclidean
norms across residual columns. We develop alternating minimization algorithms
for the standard formulations and IRLS-based algorithms for the robust
counterparts. All algorithms are theoretically proven to converge to a local
minimum.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A visual big data system for weather data analysis that handles high-volume meteorological data with missing values, performs predictive tasks using univariate/multivariate approaches and neighbor station forecasting, achieving good predictive performance and usability ratings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Meteorology generates huge amounts of sensor data with characteristics like high volume, missing values, and correlated variables, requiring Big Data techniques to extract useful knowledge for weather prediction.

Method: Proposed system collects open weather data into a NoSQL database, fuses data at different temporal/spatial aggregation levels, and uses univariate/multivariate approaches plus forecasting from neighbor stations for missing data scenarios.

Result: System achieved normalized mean squared error of 0.00013 and directional symmetry of 0.84. Experts rated all aspects (except graphic design) 3 or above on 1-5 scale, demonstrating good usability and performance.

Conclusion: The promising preliminary results validate the system's effectiveness and encourage continued work in this area of meteorological data analysis.

Abstract: The Meteorology is a field where huge amounts of data are generated, mainly
collected by sensors at weather stations, where different variables can be
measured. Those data have some particularities such as high volume and
dimensionality, the frequent existence of missing values in some stations, and
the high correlation between collected variables. In this regard, it is crucial
to make use of Big Data and Data Mining techniques to deal with those data and
extract useful knowledge from them that can be used, for instance, to predict
weather phenomena. In this paper, we propose a visual big data system that is
designed to deal with high amounts of weather-related data and lets the user
analyze those data to perform predictive tasks over the considered variables
(temperature and rainfall). The proposed system collects open data and loads
them onto a local NoSQL database fusing them at different levels of temporal
and spatial aggregation in order to perform a predictive analysis using
univariate and multivariate approaches as well as forecasting based on training
data from neighbor stations in cases with high rates of missing values. The
system has been assessed in terms of usability and predictive performance,
obtaining an overall normalized mean squared error value of 0.00013, and an
overall directional symmetry value of nearly 0.84. Our system has been rated
positively by a group of experts in the area (all aspects of the system except
graphic desing were rated 3 or above in a 1-5 scale). The promising preliminary
results obtained demonstrate the validity of our system and invite us to keep
working on this area.

*Tomer Galanti,Aarya Bookseller,Korok Ray*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A bilevel max-max optimization framework for principal-agent contract design using implicit differentiation with conjugate gradients for efficient hypergradient computation without Hessian inversion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of closed-form solutions in realistic contract design environments with nonlinear utilities, stochastic dynamics, or high-dimensional actions, which are common in applications like market design, portfolio management, and executive compensation.

Method: Uses implicit differentiation with conjugate gradients to compute hypergradients efficiently through Hessian-vector products, avoiding explicit Hessian formation or inversion. The approach is matrix-free, variance-reduced, and problem-agnostic.

Result: Successfully recovers known analytical optima in benchmark CARA-Normal environments and converges reliably from random initialization. Extends to complex nonlinear contracts including sigmoidal wage schedules, relative-performance compensation, multi-task contracts, and CARA-Poisson models.

Conclusion: Provides a new computational tool for contract design that enables systematic study of analytically intractable models, overcoming the limitations of traditional closed-form approaches.

Abstract: We study a bilevel \emph{max-max} optimization framework for principal-agent
contract design, in which a principal chooses incentives to maximize utility
while anticipating the agent's best response. This problem, central to moral
hazard and contract theory, underlies applications ranging from market design
to delegated portfolio management, hedge fund fee structures, and executive
compensation. While linear-quadratic models such as Holmstr"om-Milgrom admit
closed-form solutions, realistic environments with nonlinear utilities,
stochastic dynamics, or high-dimensional actions generally do not.
  We introduce a generic algorithmic framework that removes this reliance on
closed forms. Our method adapts modern machine learning techniques for bilevel
optimization -- using implicit differentiation with conjugate gradients (CG) --
to compute hypergradients efficiently through Hessian-vector products, without
ever forming or inverting Hessians. In benchmark CARA-Normal (Constant Absolute
Risk Aversion with Gaussian distribution of uncertainty) environments, the
approach recovers known analytical optima and converges reliably from random
initialization. More broadly, because it is matrix-free, variance-reduced, and
problem-agnostic, the framework extends naturally to complex nonlinear
contracts where closed-form solutions are unavailable, such as sigmoidal wage
schedules (logistic pay), relative-performance/tournament compensation with
common shocks, multi-task contracts with vector actions and heterogeneous
noise, and CARA-Poisson count models with $\mathbb{E}[X\mid a]=e^{a}$. This
provides a new computational tool for contract design, enabling systematic
study of models that have remained analytically intractable.

*Stephen Zhao,Aidan Li,Rob Brekelmans,Roger Grosse*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RePULSe is a new RL training method that improves the tradeoff between average reward and reducing probability of undesired outputs in language model alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL approaches optimize average reward but struggle to effectively reduce probability of undesired outputs without sacrificing average-case performance.

Method: Augments standard RL loss with an additional loss that uses learned proposals to guide sampling low-reward outputs and reduce their probability.

Result: RePULSe produces better tradeoff between expected reward and probability of undesired outputs, and is more adversarially robust compared to standard RL alignment approaches.

Conclusion: RePULSe offers an improved approach for language model alignment that better balances reward optimization with safety concerns.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a predominant technique to align
language models (LMs) with human preferences or promote outputs which are
deemed to be desirable by a given reward function. Standard RL approaches
optimize average reward, while methods explicitly focused on reducing the
probability of undesired outputs typically come at a cost to average-case
performance. To improve this tradeoff, we introduce RePULSe, a new training
method that augments the standard RL loss with an additional loss that uses
learned proposals to guide sampling low-reward outputs, and then reduces those
outputs' probability. We run experiments demonstrating that RePULSe produces a
better tradeoff of expected reward versus the probability of undesired outputs
and is more adversarially robust, compared to standard RL alignment approaches
and alternatives.

*Xiequn Wang,Zhan Zhuang,Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PLAN is a continual learning framework that extends LoRA with proactive subspace allocation using orthogonal basis vectors and perturbation-based optimization to minimize interference with past knowledge while efficiently adapting to new tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continual learning requires models to adapt to new tasks without forgetting past knowledge, but current methods struggle with interference between tasks when fine-tuning large pre-trained models.

Method: Extends Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with orthogonal basis vectors for each task, uses perturbation-based optimization to minimize conflicts, and includes a selection mechanism to identify basis vectors with minimal interference sensitivity.

Result: Empirical results on standard CL benchmarks show PLAN consistently outperforms existing methods and establishes new state-of-the-art performance for continual learning with foundation models.

Conclusion: PLAN provides an effective framework for interference-aware fine-tuning in continual learning settings, successfully balancing adaptation to new tasks with preservation of past knowledge.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) requires models to continuously adapt to new tasks
without forgetting past knowledge. In this work, we propose
\underline{P}roactive \underline{L}ow-rank \underline{A}llocatio\underline{N}
(PLAN), a framework that extends Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable efficient
and interference-aware fine-tuning of large pre-trained models in CL settings.
PLAN proactively manages the allocation of task-specific subspaces by
introducing orthogonal basis vectors for each task and optimizing them through
a perturbation-based strategy that minimizes conflicts with previously learned
parameters. Furthermore, PLAN incorporates a novel selection mechanism that
identifies and assigns basis vectors with minimal sensitivity to interference,
reducing the risk of degrading past knowledge while maintaining efficient
adaptation to new tasks. Empirical results on standard CL benchmarks
demonstrate that PLAN consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a
new state-of-the-art for continual learning with foundation models.

*Luca Demetrio,Giovanni Apruzzese,Kathrin Grosse,Pavel Laskov,Emil Lupu,Vera Rimmer,Philine Widmer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GenReview is the largest dataset of LLM-written reviews for ICLR papers (2018-2025), enabling analysis of LLM bias, detection, instruction-following, and rating alignment in peer review.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs affect scientific peer reviewing integrity and effectiveness, as evidence suggests LLMs are already being used in peer review and editorial boards are attempting to integrate them explicitly.

Method: Created GenReview dataset with 81K LLM-generated reviews for all ICLR submissions (2018-2025) using three prompts (negative, positive, neutral), linked to original papers and reviews for comparative analysis.

Result: LLMs exhibit bias in reviewing, LLM-written reviews can be automatically detected, LLMs don't always follow reviewing instructions rigorously, and LLM-provided ratings only align with acceptance decisions for accepted papers.

Conclusion: GenReview provides a comprehensive dataset to study LLM impacts on peer review, revealing biases and limitations in LLM reviewing capabilities that need addressing for responsible integration.

Abstract: How does the progressive embracement of Large Language Models (LLMs) affect
scientific peer reviewing? This multifaceted question is fundamental to the
effectiveness -- as well as to the integrity -- of the scientific process.
Recent evidence suggests that LLMs may have already been tacitly used in peer
reviewing, e.g., at the 2024 International Conference of Learning
Representations (ICLR). Furthermore, some efforts have been undertaken in an
attempt to explicitly integrate LLMs in peer reviewing by various editorial
boards (including that of ICLR'25). To fully understand the utility and the
implications of LLMs' deployment for scientific reviewing, a comprehensive
relevant dataset is strongly desirable. Despite some previous research on this
topic, such dataset has been lacking so far. We fill in this gap by presenting
GenReview, the hitherto largest dataset containing LLM-written reviews. Our
dataset includes 81K reviews generated for all submissions to the 2018--2025
editions of the ICLR by providing the LLM with three independent prompts: a
negative, a positive, and a neutral one. GenReview is also linked to the
respective papers and their original reviews, thereby enabling a broad range of
investigations. To illustrate the value of GenReview, we explore a sample of
intriguing research questions, namely: if LLMs exhibit bias in reviewing (they
do); if LLM-written reviews can be automatically detected (so far, they can);
if LLMs can rigorously follow reviewing instructions (not always) and whether
LLM-provided ratings align with decisions on paper acceptance or rejection
(holds true only for accepted papers). GenReview can be accessed at the
following link: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/gen_review.

### [173] [Online AUC Optimization Based on Second-order Surrogate Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21202)
*JunRu Luo,Difei Cheng,Bo Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a novel second-order surrogate loss for efficient online AUC optimization, achieving better regret bounds and performance than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AUC optimization faces challenges from non-convex pairwise 0/1 losses and high memory costs in large-scale applications, requiring more efficient optimization approaches.

Method: Develops a second-order surrogate loss based on pairwise hinge loss that substitutes the entire aggregated pairwise loss using first- and second-order statistics of training data, with an efficient online algorithm and kernel extension.

Result: Achieves tighter O(ln T) regret bound compared to conventional O(√T) bounds, and demonstrates superior efficiency and effectiveness on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed second-order surrogate loss provides an effective paradigm for online AUC optimization with improved theoretical guarantees and practical performance.

Abstract: The Area Under the Curve (AUC) is an important performance metric for
classification tasks, particularly in class-imbalanced scenarios. However,
minimizing the AUC presents significant challenges due to the non-convex and
discontinuous nature of pairwise 0/1 losses, which are difficult to optimize,
as well as the substantial memory cost of instance-wise storage, which creates
bottlenecks in large-scale applications. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a novel second-order surrogate loss based on the pairwise hinge loss,
and develop an efficient online algorithm. Unlike conventional approaches that
approximate each individual pairwise 0/1 loss term with an instance-wise
surrogate function, our approach introduces a new paradigm that directly
substitutes the entire aggregated pairwise loss with a surrogate loss function
constructed from the first- and second-order statistics of the training data.
Theoretically, while existing online AUC optimization algorithms typically
achieve an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound, our method attains a tighter
$\mathcal{O}(\ln T)$ bound. Furthermore, we extend the proposed framework to
nonlinear settings through a kernel-based formulation. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior efficiency and
effectiveness of the proposed second-order surrogate loss in optimizing online
AUC performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Mitra, a tabular foundation model trained on a curated mixture of synthetic priors that outperforms state-of-the-art models like TabPFNv2 and TabICL across classification and regression benchmarks with better sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Research on tabular foundation models based on in-context learning has challenged traditional machine learning paradigms, but the guiding principles for designing synthetic priors that enable good generalization remain poorly understood.

Method: Systematically investigate key properties of synthetic priors that allow pretrained TFMs to generalize well, then introduce Mitra - a TFM trained on a curated mixture of synthetic priors selected for diversity, distinctiveness, and performance on real-world data.

Result: Mitra consistently outperforms state-of-the-art TFMs (TabPFNv2 and TabICL) across both classification and regression benchmarks with better sample efficiency.

Conclusion: The work provides the first systematic investigation of synthetic prior design principles for tabular foundation models and demonstrates that carefully curated mixtures of synthetic priors can significantly improve model performance and sample efficiency.

Abstract: Since the seminal work of TabPFN, research on tabular foundation models
(TFMs) based on in-context learning (ICL) has challenged long-standing
paradigms in machine learning. Without seeing any real-world data, models
pretrained on purely synthetic datasets generalize remarkably well across
diverse datasets, often using only a moderate number of in-context examples.
This shifts the focus in tabular machine learning from model architecture
design to the design of synthetic datasets, or, more precisely, to the prior
distributions that generate them. Yet the guiding principles for prior design
remain poorly understood. This work marks the first attempt to address the gap.
We systematically investigate and identify key properties of synthetic priors
that allow pretrained TFMs to generalize well. Based on these insights, we
introduce Mitra, a TFM trained on a curated mixture of synthetic priors
selected for their diversity, distinctiveness, and performance on real-world
tabular data. Mitra consistently outperforms state-of-the-art TFMs, such as
TabPFNv2 and TabICL, across both classification and regression benchmarks, with
better sample efficiency.

TL;DR: ADaMoRE is an unsupervised framework that trains heterogeneous Mixture-of-Experts on graphs using a backbone-residual architecture with structural gating and diversity regularization, achieving SOTA performance across diverse benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs struggle with graph diversity due to fixed architectures, while existing graph MoE methods rely on supervision and suffer from training instability with heterogeneous experts.

Method: Backbone-residual expert architecture with foundational encoders for stability and specialized residual experts, structurally-aware gating network, and unified unsupervised objective combining reconstruction with diversity regularization.

Result: State-of-the-art performance in unsupervised node classification and few-shot learning across 16 benchmarks, with superior generalization, training efficiency, and faster convergence.

Conclusion: ADaMoRE enables robust unsupervised training of heterogeneous MoE on graphs, addressing adaptability challenges through principled architectural design and training objectives.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) face a fundamental adaptability challenge: their
fixed message-passing architectures struggle with the immense diversity of
real-world graphs, where optimal computational strategies vary by local
structure and task. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) offers a promising pathway
to adaptability, existing graph MoE methods remain constrained by their
reliance on supervised signals and instability when training heterogeneous
experts. We introduce ADaMoRE (Adaptive Mixture of Residual Experts), a
principled framework that enables robust, fully unsupervised training of
heterogeneous MoE on graphs. ADaMoRE employs a backbone-residual expert
architecture where foundational encoders provide stability while specialized
residual experts capture diverse computational patterns. A structurally-aware
gating network performs fine-grained node routing. The entire architecture is
trained end-to-end using a unified unsupervised objective, which integrates a
primary reconstruction task with an information-theoretic diversity regularizer
to explicitly enforce functional specialization among the experts. Theoretical
analysis confirms our design improves data efficiency and training stability.
Extensive evaluation across 16 benchmarks validates ADaMoRE's state-of-the-art
performance in unsupervised node classification and few-shot learning,
alongside superior generalization, training efficiency, and faster convergence
on diverse graphs and tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework that constrains flow matching generative models to traverse physical equilibrium states, making intermediate generation steps interpretable through physical processes like the 2D Ising model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard flow matching models lack interpretability in their intermediate generation steps, as the vector field updates remain opaque. The goal is to embed physical semantics into generative flows to make neural trajectories interpretable.

Method: Proposed architecture with: 1) encoder mapping discrete Ising configurations to continuous latent space, 2) flow-matching network performing temperature-driven diffusion, and 3) projector returning to discrete Ising states while preserving physical constraints. Flow steps are constrained to be thermal equilibrium points along a parametric cooling schedule.

Result: Validated across multiple lattice sizes, the framework preserves physical fidelity while outperforming Monte Carlo generation in speed as lattice size increases. Each vector field represents meaningful stepwise transitions in the 2D Ising model's latent space.

Conclusion: Embedding physical semantics into generative flows transforms opaque neural trajectories into interpretable physical processes, demonstrating that flow matching can be made interpretable through physical constraints.

Abstract: Generative models based on flow matching have demonstrated remarkable success
in various domains, yet they suffer from a fundamental limitation: the lack of
interpretability in their intermediate generation steps. In fact these models
learn to transform noise into data through a series of vector field updates,
however the meaning of each step remains opaque. We address this problem by
proposing a general framework constraining each flow step to be sampled from a
known physical distribution. Flow trajectories are mapped to (and constrained
to traverse) the equilibrium states of the simulated physical process. We
implement this approach through the 2D Ising model in such a way that flow
steps become thermal equilibrium points along a parametric cooling schedule.
  Our proposed architecture includes an encoder that maps discrete Ising
configurations into a continuous latent space, a flow-matching network that
performs temperature-driven diffusion, and a projector that returns to discrete
Ising states while preserving physical constraints.
  We validate this framework across multiple lattice sizes, showing that it
preserves physical fidelity while outperforming Monte Carlo generation in speed
as the lattice size increases. In contrast with standard flow matching, each
vector field represents a meaningful stepwise transition in the 2D Ising
model's latent space. This demonstrates that embedding physical semantics into
generative flows transforms opaque neural trajectories into interpretable
physical processes.

Motivation: Existing model merging methods operate in parameter space and are constrained by parameter inconsistencies, limiting their effectiveness in integrating knowledge from multiple finetuned checkpoints.

Method: Proposes Functional Dual Anchors (FDAs) - synthetic inputs whose induced gradients align with task vectors, capturing task-specific functional shifts relative to the pretrained model. Includes principled initialization scheme.

Result: Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of FDAs in model merging, showing they are complementary to parameter-space model merging methods.

Conclusion: FDAs provide a robust and flexible framework for model merging that bridges joint multi-task training and post-hoc merging, offering advantages over parameter-space approaches.

Abstract: Model merging is an efficient post-training strategy for integrating
knowledge from multiple finetuned checkpoints of a shared foundation model.
Existing methods operate in the parameter space, combining task vectors to
mitigate conflicts, but remain constrained by parameter inconsistencies. We
propose Functional Dual Anchors (FDAs), a framework that instead models the
input-representation space. FDAs are synthetic inputs whose induced gradients
align with task vectors, capturing task-specific functional shifts relative to
the pretrained model. This perspective bridges joint multi-task training and
post-hoc merging, offering both robustness and flexibility. We further
introduce a principled initialization scheme and show that FDAs are
complementary to parameter-space model merging. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of FDAs in model merging.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of constructing most confusing instances in neural network world models for RL, proposing an adversarial training method to find alternative models that are statistically close to reference models but make suboptimal policies optimal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While most confusing instances are well-studied in simpler RL settings like multi-armed bandits and tabular MDPs, constructing such instances remains an open problem in the general case, particularly for neural network world models.

Method: The authors formalize the problem as constrained optimization and propose an adversarial training procedure to find modified models that are statistically close to reference models while producing divergent performance between optimal and suboptimal policies.

Result: Empirical studies across world models of varying quality suggest that the degree of achievable confusion correlates with uncertainty in the approximate model.

Conclusion: The findings may inform theoretically-grounded exploration strategies for deep model-based reinforcement learning by relating model uncertainty to the potential for confusion between optimal and suboptimal policies.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL) theory, the concept of most confusing
instances is central to establishing regret lower bounds, that is, the minimal
exploration needed to solve a problem. Given a reference model and its optimal
policy, a most confusing instance is the statistically closest alternative
model that makes a suboptimal policy optimal. While this concept is
well-studied in multi-armed bandits and ergodic tabular Markov decision
processes, constructing such instances remains an open question in the general
case. In this paper, we formalize this problem for neural network world models
as a constrained optimization: finding a modified model that is statistically
close to the reference one, while producing divergent performance between
optimal and suboptimal policies. We propose an adversarial training procedure
to solve this problem and conduct an empirical study across world models of
varying quality. Our results suggest that the degree of achievable confusion
correlates with uncertainty in the approximate model, which may inform
theoretically-grounded exploration strategies for deep model-based RL.

Method: Analyze SGLD with multiplicative and state-dependent noise under regularity conditions on Hessian of loss function, establishing non-degenerate kernel and convergence properties.

Result: SGLD yields non-degenerate kernel throughout training with high probability and achieves exponential convergence to empirical risk minimizer in expectation, with finite-time and finite-width bounds on optimality gap.

Conclusion: Theoretical findings are corroborated with numerical examples in regression setting, validating the established convergence properties of SGLD in lazy training regime.

Abstract: Continuous-time models provide important insights into the training dynamics
of optimization algorithms in deep learning. In this work, we establish a
non-asymptotic convergence analysis of stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics
(SGLD), which is an It\^o stochastic differential equation (SDE) approximation
of stochastic gradient descent in continuous time, in the lazy training regime.
We show that, under regularity conditions on the Hessian of the loss function,
SGLD with multiplicative and state-dependent noise (i) yields a non-degenerate
kernel throughout the training process with high probability, and (ii) achieves
exponential convergence to the empirical risk minimizer in expectation, and we
establish finite-time and finite-width bounds on the optimality gap. We
corroborate our theoretical findings with numerical examples in the regression

*Andrea Bonfanti,Ismael Medina,Roman List,Björn Staeves,Roberto Santana,Marco Ellero*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PINN Balls introduces a local Mixture of Experts model with learnable domain decomposition to enable efficient second-order training of Physics-Informed Neural Networks, achieving better accuracy than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Second-order methods enhance PINN training but have large memory requirements that scale poorly with model size. The paper aims to overcome this limitation while maintaining the benefits of second-order optimization.

Method: Uses a local Mixture of Experts combining parameter-efficient ensemble models and sparse coding, with fully learnable domain decomposition through Adversarial Adaptive Sampling that adapts to the PDE and its domain.

Result: PINN Balls achieves better accuracy than state-of-the-art methods in scientific machine learning while maintaining scalability properties.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully enables second-order training of PINNs through efficient domain decomposition and expert mixture models, providing both theoretical soundness and practical scalability.

Abstract: Recent advances in Scientific Machine Learning have shown that second-order
methods can enhance the training of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs),
making them a suitable alternative to traditional numerical methods for Partial
Differential Equations (PDEs). However, second-order methods induce large
memory requirements, making them scale poorly with the model size. In this
paper, we define a local Mixture of Experts (MoE) combining the
parameter-efficiency of ensemble models and sparse coding to enable the use of
second-order training. Our model -- \textsc{PINN Balls} -- also features a
fully learnable domain decomposition structure, achieved through the use of
Adversarial Adaptive Sampling (AAS), which adapts the DD to the PDE and its
domain. \textsc{PINN Balls} achieves better accuracy than the state-of-the-art
in scientific machine learning, while maintaining invaluable scalability
properties and drawing from a sound theoretical background.

### [182] [Relieving the Over-Aggregating Effect in Graph Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21267)
*Junshu Sun,Wanxing Chang,Chenxue Yang,Qingming Huang,Shuhui Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Wideformer is a plug-and-play method that addresses over-aggregating in graph attention by dividing node aggregation into parallel processes and guiding the model to focus on specific subsets, preventing message dilution and information loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph attention faces challenges with global interactions due to large numbers of nodes, leading to over-aggregating where key messages get diluted when too many messages are aggregated into single nodes with less discrimination.

Method: Wideformer divides aggregation of all nodes into parallel processes to limit input volume per aggregation, and uses a guiding step that sorts and weights aggregation outputs to prioritize informative messages.

Result: Evaluations show Wideformer effectively mitigates over-aggregating, allowing backbone methods to focus on informative messages and achieve superior performance compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: Wideformer provides an effective solution to the over-aggregating problem in graph attention through parallel aggregation processes and guided message prioritization, improving overall model performance.

Abstract: Graph attention has demonstrated superior performance in graph learning
tasks. However, learning from global interactions can be challenging due to the
large number of nodes. In this paper, we discover a new phenomenon termed
over-aggregating. Over-aggregating arises when a large volume of messages is
aggregated into a single node with less discrimination, leading to the dilution
of the key messages and potential information loss. To address this, we propose
Wideformer, a plug-and-play method for graph attention. Wideformer divides the
aggregation of all nodes into parallel processes and guides the model to focus
on specific subsets of these processes. The division can limit the input volume
per aggregation, avoiding message dilution and reducing information loss. The
guiding step sorts and weights the aggregation outputs, prioritizing the
informative messages. Evaluations show that Wideformer can effectively mitigate
over-aggregating. As a result, the backbone methods can focus on the
informative messages, achieving superior performance compared to baseline
methods.

*Hyeongyu Kim,Geonhui Han,Dosik Hwang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel Buffer layer approach for Test Time Adaptation that overcomes limitations of normalization-based methods by preserving pre-trained backbone integrity while enabling effective domain adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Normalization-based TTA methods face challenges with small batch sizes, unstable statistics, and limited generalization to unseen domains due to reliance on training-time statistics.

Method: Introduces a Buffer layer paradigm that avoids modifying core model parameters, preserving pre-trained backbone integrity and mitigating catastrophic forgetting during online adaptation.

Result: Outperforms traditional methods in domain shift mitigation and robustness, shows strong resilience to forgetting, and integrates seamlessly into existing TTA frameworks with consistent performance improvements.

Conclusion: The Buffer layer provides an effective and versatile solution for real-world domain adaptation scenarios, addressing fundamental limitations of normalization-based approaches.

Abstract: In recent advancements in Test Time Adaptation (TTA), most existing
methodologies focus on updating normalization layers to adapt to the test
domain. However, the reliance on normalization-based adaptation presents key
challenges. First, normalization layers such as Batch Normalization (BN) are
highly sensitive to small batch sizes, leading to unstable and inaccurate
statistics. Moreover, normalization-based adaptation is inherently constrained
by the structure of the pre-trained model, as it relies on training-time
statistics that may not generalize well to unseen domains. These issues limit
the effectiveness of normalization-based TTA approaches, especially under
significant domain shift. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm based on
the concept of a Buffer layer, which addresses the fundamental limitations of
normalization layer updates. Unlike existing methods that modify the core
parameters of the model, our approach preserves the integrity of the
pre-trained backbone, inherently mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting
during online adaptation. Through comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate
that our approach not only outperforms traditional methods in mitigating domain
shift and enhancing model robustness, but also exhibits strong resilience to
forgetting. Furthermore, our Buffer layer is modular and can be seamlessly
integrated into nearly all existing TTA frameworks, resulting in consistent
performance improvements across various architectures. These findings validate
the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed solution in real-world domain
adaptation scenarios. The code is available at

*Pavankumar Chandankar,Robin Burchard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A noise-aware ensemble approach using PatchTST transformers achieves robust human activity recognition by training sensor-specific models with test-time noise augmentation and averaging predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of robust human activity recognition under real-world noisy conditions, particularly for the WEAR Dataset Challenge where sensor data contains various perturbations.

Method: Train four independent PatchTST transformer models (one per sensor location) using noise-augmented training data with jitter, scaling, rotation, and channel dropout. At inference, average softmax probabilities from all four sensor models.

Result: Achieved macro-F1 substantially above baseline on the private leaderboard, demonstrating effectiveness for noisy HAR conditions.

Conclusion: Test-matched augmentation combined with transformer-based ensembling is an effective strategy for robust human activity recognition under noisy sensor conditions.

Abstract: We present a noise-aware, sensor-specific ensemble approach for robust human
activity recognition on the 2nd WEAR Dataset Challenge. Our method leverages
the PatchTST transformer architecture, training four independent models-one per
inertial sensor location-on a tampered training set whose 1-second sliding
windows are augmented to mimic the test-time noise. By aligning the train and
test data schemas (JSON-encoded 50-sample windows) and applying randomized
jitter, scaling, rotation, and channel dropout, each PatchTST model learns to
generalize across real-world sensor perturbations. At inference, we compute
softmax probabilities from all four sensor models on the Kaggle test set and
average them to produce final labels. On the private leaderboard, this pipeline
achieves a macro-F1 substantially above the baseline, demonstrating that
test-matched augmentation combined with transformer-based ensembling is an
effective strategy for robust HAR under noisy conditions.

*Xiyang Zhang,Chen Liang,Haoxuan Qiu,Hongzhi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DVC is a novel budget-aware data selection method for MLP training that evaluates data contributions through hierarchical metrics and adaptive source selection, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data selection methods oversimplify nonlinear transformations, ignore intermediate representations, or have high computational complexity, making them unsuitable for large MLPs with budget constraints.

Method: Proposes DVC method that decomposes data contribution into Layer Value Contribution (LVC) and Global Value Contribution (GVC) using six metrics across quality, relevance, and diversity dimensions, integrated with UCB algorithm for adaptive source selection.

Result: Extensive experiments on six datasets and eight baselines show DVC consistently outperforms existing methods under various budget constraints, achieving superior accuracy and F1 scores.

Conclusion: DVC provides the first systematic hierarchical data evaluation for neural networks with theoretical guarantees and practical advantages for large-scale ML systems.

Abstract: Data selection is one of the fundamental problems in neural network training,
particularly for multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) where identifying the most
valuable training samples from massive, multi-source, and heterogeneous data
sources under budget constraints poses significant challenges. Existing data
selection methods, including coreset construction, data Shapley values, and
influence functions, suffer from critical limitations: they oversimplify
nonlinear transformations, ignore informative intermediate representations in
hidden layers, or fail to scale to larger MLPs due to high computational
complexity. In response, we propose DVC (Data Value Contribution), a novel
budget-aware method for evaluating and selecting data for MLP training that
accounts for the dynamic evolution of network parameters during training. The
DVC method decomposes data contribution into Layer Value Contribution (LVC) and
Global Value Contribution (GVC), employing six carefully designed metrics and
corresponding efficient algorithms to capture data characteristics across three
dimensions--quality, relevance, and distributional diversity--at different
granularities. DVC integrates these assessments with an Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) algorithm for adaptive source selection that balances exploration and
exploitation. Extensive experiments across six datasets and eight baselines
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches under
various budget constraints, achieving superior accuracy and F1 scores. Our
approach represents the first systematic treatment of hierarchical data
evaluation for neural networks, providing both theoretical guarantees and
practical advantages for large-scale machine learning systems.

### [186] [A Convergence Analysis of Adaptive Optimizers under Floating-point Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21314)
*Xuan Tang,Jichu Li,Difan Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides the first theoretical framework for analyzing convergence of adaptive optimizers (Adam and Muon) under floating-point quantization of gradients, weights, and optimizer states, showing they maintain near-full-precision convergence rates with logarithmic mantissa scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing convergence theories for adaptive optimizers assume exact components and neglect hardware-aware quantization, leaving a gap in understanding why low-precision training remains effective despite quantization errors.

Method: Developed a theoretical framework to analyze convergence rates of Adam and Muon under quantization of gradients, weights, and optimizer states on smooth non-convex objectives under standard stochastic gradient assumptions.

Result: Both Adam and Muon retain convergence rates close to full-precision counterparts when mantissa length scales logarithmically with iterations. Adam is highly sensitive to weights and second-moment quantization, while Muon requires weaker error control and is more robust.

Conclusion: The analysis bridges the gap between empirical success and theoretical understanding of low-precision training methods, with numerical experiments supporting the theoretical findings.

Abstract: The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has made low-precision
training essential for reducing memory, improving efficiency, and enabling
larger models and datasets. Existing convergence theories for adaptive
optimizers, however, assume all components are exact and neglect hardware-aware
quantization, leaving open the question of why low-precision training remains
effective. We introduce the first theoretical framework for analyzing the
convergence of adaptive optimizers, including Adam and Muon, under
floating-point quantization of gradients, weights, and optimizer states (e.g.,
moment estimates). Within this framework, we derive convergence rates on smooth
non-convex objectives under standard stochastic gradient assumptions,
explicitly characterizing how quantization errors from different components
affect convergence. We show that both algorithms retain rates close to their
full-precision counterparts provided mantissa length scales only
logarithmically with the number of iterations. Our analysis further reveals
that Adam is highly sensitive to weights and second-moment quantization due to
its reliance on $\beta_2 \to 1$, while Muon requires weaker error control and
is thus potentially more robust. These results narrow the gap between empirical
success and theoretical understanding of low-precision training methods.
Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world data corroborate our theory.

### [187] [Additive Models Explained: A Computational Complexity Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21292)
*Shahaf Bassan,Michal Moshkovitz,Guy Katz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the computational complexity of generating explanations for Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), revealing that explanation complexity depends heavily on input space structure, component models, task type (regression vs classification), and explanation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that GAMs are inherently easy to explain by rigorously analyzing the computational complexity of generating different types of explanations for various GAM forms.

Method: Theoretical complexity analysis using standard computational complexity assumptions (P!=NP) to examine explanation generation for different GAM variants across multiple contexts and input domains.

Result: Found surprising diversity in complexity outcomes: (1) explanation complexity heavily depends on input space structure, (2) varies with component models under specific domains, (3) differs between regression and classification tasks, (4) additive representations (like neural additive models) can make explanations easier but only for certain methods and domains.

Conclusion: The study provides a rigorous theoretical framework showing that computing explanations for GAMs is not universally easy - feasibility depends on specific conditions, with some cases being computationally hard while others remain tractable.

Abstract: Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) are commonly considered *interpretable*
within the ML community, as their structure makes the relationship between
inputs and outputs relatively understandable. Therefore, it may seem natural to
hypothesize that obtaining meaningful explanations for GAMs could be performed
efficiently and would not be computationally infeasible. In this work, we
challenge this hypothesis by analyzing the *computational complexity* of
generating different explanations for various forms of GAMs across multiple
contexts. Our analysis reveals a surprisingly diverse landscape of both
positive and negative complexity outcomes. Particularly, under standard
complexity assumptions such as P!=NP, we establish several key findings: (1) in
stark contrast to many other common ML models, the complexity of generating
explanations for GAMs is heavily influenced by the structure of the input
space; (2) the complexity of explaining GAMs varies significantly with the
types of component models used - but interestingly, these differences only
emerge under specific input domain settings; (3) significant complexity
distinctions appear for obtaining explanations in regression tasks versus
classification tasks in GAMs; and (4) expressing complex models like neural
networks additively (e.g., as neural additive models) can make them easier to
explain, though interestingly, this benefit appears only for certain
explanation methods and input domains. Collectively, these results shed light
on the feasibility of computing diverse explanations for GAMs, offering a
rigorous theoretical picture of the conditions under which such computations
are possible or provably hard.

*Myeongho Jeon,Jan Sobotka,Suhwan Choi,Maria Brbić*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RAVEN is a robust weak-to-strong generalization framework that addresses the failure of naive weak-to-strong generalization under distribution shifts by dynamically learning optimal combinations of weak models and strong model parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As superhuman models become more complex, human supervision becomes insufficient. While weak models can supervise strong models (weak-to-strong generalization), this approach fails under distribution shifts, often making strong models perform worse than their weak supervisors.

Method: RAVEN dynamically learns the optimal combinations of weak models in addition to parameters of the strong model, enabling robust weak-to-strong generalization that adapts to distribution shifts.

Result: RAVEN outperforms alternative baselines by over 30% on out-of-distribution tasks while matching or surpassing existing methods on in-distribution tasks. It automatically assigns higher weights to more accurate weak models, demonstrating its ability to identify trustworthy supervision.

Conclusion: RAVEN provides an effective solution for robust weak-to-strong generalization that works well under distribution shifts, enabling reliable supervision of complex superhuman models when human oversight becomes insufficient.

Abstract: As future superhuman models become increasingly complex, accurately
supervising their behavior may exceed human capabilities. Recent works have
demonstrated that in such scenarios, weak models can effectively supervise
strong models, a phenomenon known as weak-to-strong generalization. However, we
find that naive weak-to-strong generalization fails under distribution shifts,
often leading to worse performance of the strong model than its weak
supervisors. To address this, we propose RAVEN, a robust weak-to-strong
generalization framework that dynamically learns the optimal combinations of
weak models in addition to parameters of the strong model. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of RAVEN on image classification, text classification, and
preference alignment tasks. RAVEN outperforms alternative baselines by over 30%
on out-of-distribution tasks while matching or surpassing existing methods on
in-distribution tasks. Moreover, our results show that RAVEN assigns higher
weights to more accurate weak models, demonstrating its ability to
automatically identify trustworthy supervision.

*Sukanya Patra,Souhaib Ben Taieb*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EPHAD is a test-time adaptation framework that improves anomaly detection performance on contaminated datasets by combining prior knowledge from trained models with evidence from foundation models or domain knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world datasets often contain undetected anomalies that degrade unsupervised anomaly detection performance, and existing solutions require access to training pipelines or prior knowledge of anomaly proportions.

Method: EPHAD updates AD model outputs at test time by integrating prior knowledge from models trained on contaminated data with evidence from multimodal foundation models (like CLIP), classical AD methods, or domain-specific knowledge.

Result: Comprehensive experiments across 8 visual AD datasets, 26 tabular AD datasets, and a real-world industrial dataset show effectiveness, with ablation studies demonstrating robustness to varying contamination levels.

Conclusion: EPHAD provides a versatile and robust framework for improving anomaly detection on contaminated datasets without requiring access to training pipelines or prior knowledge of anomaly proportions.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) methods typically assume clean training
data, yet real-world datasets often contain undetected or mislabeled anomalies,
leading to significant performance degradation. Existing solutions require
access to the training pipelines, data or prior knowledge of the proportions of
anomalies in the data, limiting their real-world applicability. To address this
challenge, we propose EPHAD, a simple yet effective test-time adaptation
framework that updates the outputs of AD models trained on contaminated
datasets using evidence gathered at test time. Our approach integrates the
prior knowledge captured by the AD model trained on contaminated datasets with
evidence derived from multimodal foundation models like Contrastive
Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), classical AD methods like the Latent
Outlier Factor or domain-specific knowledge. We illustrate the intuition behind
EPHAD using a synthetic toy example and validate its effectiveness through
comprehensive experiments across eight visual AD datasets, twenty-six tabular
AD datasets, and a real-world industrial AD dataset. Additionally, we conduct
an ablation study to analyse hyperparameter influence and robustness to varying
contamination levels, demonstrating the versatility and robustness of EPHAD
across diverse AD models and evidence pairs. To ensure reproducibility, our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/sukanyapatra1997/EPHAD.

TL;DR: A new class of reparameterization methods for transfer learning is introduced to enhance generalization ability of fine-tuned models, validated theoretically and experimentally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the generalization ability of fine-tuned models in transfer learning, addressing limitations of existing reparameterization methods like LoRA.

Method: Developed a new class of reparameterization methods for transfer learning, analyzed using Random Matrix Theory in high-dimensional binary classification, and validated through practical experiments including LLM fine-tuning.

Result: The approach demonstrates enhanced generalization ability, with theoretical effectiveness established through Random Matrix Theory and practical validation in realistic experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed reparameterization methods effectively improve generalization in transfer learning, offering a promising alternative to existing approaches like LoRA.

Abstract: Fine-tuning has proven to be highly effective in adapting pre-trained models
to perform better on new desired tasks with minimal data samples. Among the
most widely used approaches are reparameterization methods, which update a
target module by augmenting its frozen weight matrix with an additional
trainable weight matrix. The most prominent example is Low Rank Adaption
(LoRA), which gained significant attention in recent years. In this paper, we
introduce a new class of reparameterization methods for transfer learning,
designed to enhance the generalization ability of fine-tuned models. We
establish the effectiveness of our approach in a high-dimensional binary
classification setting using tools from Random Matrix Theory, and further
validate our theoretical findings through more realistic experiments, such as
fine-tuning LLMs.

*Tobias Fuchs,Nadja Klein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A probabilistic framework using amortized variational inference for partial-label learning that directly approximates true label posteriors, achieving state-of-the-art performance in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data is often noisy with conflicting labels from multiple annotators. Partial-label learning addresses this by training classifiers when each instance has multiple candidate labels but only one is correct. Existing methods are either computationally intensive or rely on heuristic approaches.

Method: Novel probabilistic framework using amortized variational inference to directly approximate posterior distribution over true labels. Employs neural networks to predict variational parameters from input data, enabling efficient inference while being architecture-agnostic.

Result: Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully combines the expressiveness of deep learning with the rigor of probabilistic modeling, providing an efficient and accurate solution for partial-label learning problems.

Abstract: Real-world data is frequently noisy and ambiguous. In crowdsourcing, for
example, human annotators may assign conflicting class labels to the same
instances. Partial-label learning (PLL) addresses this challenge by training
classifiers when each instance is associated with a set of candidate labels,
only one of which is correct. While early PLL methods approximate the true
label posterior, they are often computationally intensive. Recent deep learning
approaches improve scalability but rely on surrogate losses and heuristic label
refinement. We introduce a novel probabilistic framework that directly
approximates the posterior distribution over true labels using amortized
variational inference. Our method employs neural networks to predict
variational parameters from input data, enabling efficient inference. This
approach combines the expressiveness of deep learning with the rigor of
probabilistic modeling, while remaining architecture-agnostic. Theoretical
analysis and extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
accuracy and efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines how data differences affect model multiplicity, finding that datasets with greater inter-class overlap actually show lower multiplicity, contrary to expectations. The authors develop a neighboring datasets framework and apply it to active learning and data imputation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While prior work focused on modeling choices, the critical role of data in shaping multiplicity has been overlooked. The authors aim to understand how single-data-point differences affect multiplicity.

Method: Introduce a neighboring datasets framework to examine the impact of single-data-point differences on multiplicity. Extend this framework to active learning and data imputation, proposing multiplicity-aware methods for both domains.

Result: Found that neighboring datasets with greater inter-class distribution overlap exhibit lower multiplicity, which reverses conventional expectations. This phenomenon arises from a shared Rashomon parameter.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a data-centric perspective on multiplicity, provides rigorous proofs for counterintuitive findings about inter-class overlap, and develops practical multiplicity-aware methods for active learning and data imputation.

Abstract: Multiplicity -- the existence of distinct models with comparable performance
-- has received growing attention in recent years. While prior work has largely
emphasized modelling choices, the critical role of data in shaping multiplicity
has been comparatively overlooked. In this work, we introduce a neighbouring
datasets framework to examine the most granular case: the impact of a
single-data-point difference on multiplicity. Our analysis yields a seemingly
counterintuitive finding: neighbouring datasets with greater inter-class
distribution overlap exhibit lower multiplicity. This reversal of conventional
expectations arises from a shared Rashomon parameter, and we substantiate it
with rigorous proofs.
  Building on this foundation, we extend our framework to two practical
domains: active learning and data imputation. For each, we establish natural
extensions of the neighbouring datasets perspective, conduct the first
systematic study of multiplicity in existing algorithms, and finally, propose
novel multiplicity-aware methods, namely, multiplicity-aware data acquisition
strategies for active learning and multiplicity-aware data imputation
techniques.

*Dhruv Sarkar,Nishant Pandey,Sayak Ray Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper shows that standard UCB algorithms with initial uniform exploration can achieve near-optimal Nash regret and generalize to p-mean regret, overcoming limitations of prior specialized approaches that required strong assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional regret metrics in multi-armed bandits fail to address fairness among agents, particularly in population settings like clinical trials. Nash regret using geometric mean better captures fairness but existing approaches require restrictive assumptions.

Method: Proposes using initial uniform exploration phase followed by standard Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm, relying only on additive Hoeffding bounds and extending to sub-Gaussian rewards.

Result: Achieves near-optimal Nash regret bounds and generalizes to p-mean regret metrics, providing optimal regret bounds uniformly across all p values without restrictive assumptions.

Conclusion: Standard bandit algorithms with simple modifications can effectively address fairness concerns through Nash regret and p-mean regret, eliminating the need for specialized designs and strong assumptions required by prior work.

Abstract: Regret in stochastic multi-armed bandits traditionally measures the
difference between the highest reward and either the arithmetic mean of
accumulated rewards or the final reward. These conventional metrics often fail
to address fairness among agents receiving rewards, particularly in settings
where rewards are distributed across a population, such as patients in clinical
trials. To address this, a recent body of work has introduced Nash regret,
which evaluates performance via the geometric mean of accumulated rewards,
aligning with the Nash social welfare function known for satisfying fairness
axioms.
  To minimize Nash regret, existing approaches require specialized algorithm
designs and strong assumptions, such as multiplicative concentration
inequalities and bounded, non-negative rewards, making them unsuitable for even
Gaussian reward distributions. We demonstrate that an initial uniform
exploration phase followed by a standard Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm
achieves near-optimal Nash regret, while relying only on additive Hoeffding
bounds, and naturally extending to sub-Gaussian rewards. Furthermore, we
generalize the algorithm to a broad class of fairness metrics called the
$p$-mean regret, proving (nearly) optimal regret bounds uniformly across all
$p$ values. This is in contrast to prior work, which made extremely restrictive
assumptions on the bandit instances and even then achieved suboptimal regret
bounds.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transparent white-box AI assistance applied as quality-control review significantly improves sleep event scoring accuracy by ~30% over black-box AI, reduces inter-rater variability, and is preferred by clinicians despite increased time requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems need more than high accuracy for clinical integration - clinicians must understand when and why to trust algorithmic recommendations to effectively incorporate AI into medical practice.

Method: User study with 8 sleep medicine practitioners scoring polysomnographic data under three conditions: manual scoring, black-box AI assistance, and transparent white-box AI assistance, with assistance provided either at start or as post-hoc quality-control review.

Result: Both AI and human-AI teams outperformed unaided experts against clinical standards. Transparent AI assistance as QC improved event-level performance by ~30% over black-box, reduced inter-rater variability, and was overwhelmingly preferred by participants (7/8 willing to adopt with minor/no modifications).

Conclusion: Strategically timed transparent AI assistance effectively balances accuracy and clinical efficiency, providing a promising pathway for trustworthy AI integration and user acceptance in clinical workflows.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly match or surpass human
experts in biomedical signal interpretation. However, their effective
integration into clinical practice requires more than high predictive accuracy.
Clinicians must discern \textit{when} and \textit{why} to trust algorithmic
recommendations. This work presents an application-grounded user study with
eight professional sleep medicine practitioners, who score nocturnal arousal
events in polysomnographic data under three conditions: (i) manual scoring,
(ii) black-box (BB) AI assistance, and (iii) transparent white-box (WB) AI
assistance. Assistance is provided either from the \textit{start} of scoring or
as a post-hoc quality-control (\textit{QC}) review. We systematically evaluate
how the type and timing of assistance influence event-level and clinically most
relevant count-based performance, time requirements, and user experience. When
evaluated against the clinical standard used to train the AI, both AI and
human-AI teams significantly outperform unaided experts, with collaboration
also reducing inter-rater variability. Notably, transparent AI assistance
applied as a targeted QC step yields median event-level performance
improvements of approximately 30\% over black-box assistance, and QC timing
further enhances count-based outcomes. While WB and QC approaches increase the
time required for scoring, start-time assistance is faster and preferred by
most participants. Participants overwhelmingly favor transparency, with seven
out of eight expressing willingness to adopt the system with minor or no
modifications. In summary, strategically timed transparent AI assistance
effectively balances accuracy and clinical efficiency, providing a promising
pathway toward trustworthy AI integration and user acceptance in clinical

### [195] [Large Language Models as Model Organisms for Human Associative Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21408)
*Camila Kolling,Vy Ai Vo,Mariya Toneva*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs show non-monotonic representational changes during associative learning, with vocabulary interference modulating differentiation between associated items.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To use LLMs as scalable models to study how representations evolve during associative learning, building on cognitive neuroscience paradigms.

Method: Adapted a cognitive neuroscience associative learning paradigm using LLMs' in-context learning capabilities across six models, analyzing representational changes and vocabulary interference effects.

Result: Found non-monotonic plasticity pattern with moderate similarity items differentiating after learning, and higher vocabulary interference amplifies this differentiation.

Conclusion: LLMs serve as powerful tools for studying representational dynamics and generating hypotheses about memory reorganization principles in biological systems.

Abstract: Associative learning--forming links between co-occurring items--is
fundamental to human cognition, reshaping internal representations in complex
ways. Testing hypotheses on how representational changes occur in biological
systems is challenging, but large language models (LLMs) offer a scalable
alternative. Building on LLMs' in-context learning, we adapt a cognitive
neuroscience associative learning paradigm and investigate how representations
evolve across six models. Our initial findings reveal a non-monotonic pattern
consistent with the Non-Monotonic Plasticity Hypothesis, with moderately
similar items differentiating after learning. Leveraging the controllability of
LLMs, we further show that this differentiation is modulated by the overlap of
associated items with the broader vocabulary--a factor we term vocabulary
interference, capturing how new associations compete with prior knowledge. We
find that higher vocabulary interference amplifies differentiation, suggesting
that representational change is influenced by both item similarity and global
competition. Our findings position LLMs not only as powerful tools for studying
representational dynamics in human-like learning systems, but also as
accessible and general computational models for generating new hypotheses about
the principles underlying memory reorganization in the brain.

### [196] [Leverage Unlearning to Sanitize LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21322)
*Antoine Boutet,Lucas Magnana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SANI is an unlearning approach that sanitizes language models by resetting neurons in last layers and fine-tuning to remove memorized sensitive information, reducing regurgitations with minimal additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuned LLMs memorize sensitive data from specialized corpora (medical/business data), posing privacy risks when regurgitated. Need cost-effective sanitization without full retraining.

Method: Two-phase approach: 1) Erasure phase resets neurons in last layers to disrupt memorization, 2) Repair phase fine-tunes model while avoiding sensitive data memorization.

Result: With few additional unlearning epochs, model is sanitized and regurgitations drastically reduced. Effective for removing identifiers from medical models and confidential terms from pre-trained models.

Conclusion: SANI provides efficient model sanitization for industries like healthcare that need to share models trained on sensitive data, offering privacy protection without costly retraining.

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are becoming useful for various
tasks. To improve their performance on certain tasks, it is necessary to
fine-tune them on specific data corpora (e.g., medical reports, business data).
These specialized data corpora may contain sensitive data (e.g., personal or
confidential data) that will be memorized by the model and likely to be
regurgitated during its subsequent use. This memorization of sensitive
information by the model poses a significant privacy or confidentiality issue.
To remove this memorization and sanitize the model without requiring costly
additional fine-tuning on a secured data corpus, we propose SANI. SANI is an
unlearning approach to sanitize language models. It relies on both an erasure
and repair phases that 1) reset certain neurons in the last layers of the model
to disrupt the memorization of fine-grained information, and then 2) fine-tune
the model while avoiding memorizing sensitive information. We comprehensively
evaluate SANI to sanitize both a model fine-tuned and specialized with medical
data by removing directly and indirectly identifiers from the memorization of
the model, and a standard pre-trained model by removing specific terms defined
as confidential information from the model. Results show that with only few
additional epochs of unlearning, the model is sanitized and the number of
regurgitations is drastically reduced. This approach can be particularly useful
for hospitals or other industries that have already spent significant resources
training models on large datasets and wish to sanitize them before sharing.

Motivation: To enhance exploration and learning efficiency in reinforcement learning, particularly in sparse-reward environments where standard methods struggle.

Method: Two key extensions: (1) prioritized replay buffer that scores trajectories by return, reconstruction loss, and value error; (2) intrinsic reward based on disagreement over predicted environment rewards from an ensemble of world models.

Conclusion: The proposed extensions successfully improve DreamerV3's exploration capabilities and learning efficiency, making it more effective in challenging sparse-reward environments.

Abstract: We introduce DreamerV3-XP, an extension of DreamerV3 that improves
exploration and learning efficiency. This includes (i) a prioritized replay
buffer, scoring trajectories by return, reconstruction loss, and value error
and (ii) an intrinsic reward based on disagreement over predicted environment
rewards from an ensemble of world models. DreamerV3-XP is evaluated on a subset
of Atari100k and DeepMind Control Visual Benchmark tasks, confirming the
original DreamerV3 results and showing that our extensions lead to faster
learning and lower dynamics model loss, particularly in sparse-reward settings.

*Vikas Kanaujia,Vipul Arora*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ScoreNF is a score-based learning framework using Normalizing Flow architecture with Independent Metropolis-Hastings module for efficient unbiased sampling from unnormalized distributions, reducing reliance on expensive MCMC training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MCMC methods suffer from slow convergence, critical slowing down, poor mode mixing, and high autocorrelation, while likelihood-based and adversarial models require large datasets and face mode covering/collapse issues.

Method: Propose ScoreNF framework combining score-based learning with Normalizing Flow architecture and Independent Metropolis-Hastings module for sampling from unnormalized distributions.

Result: ScoreNF maintains high performance with small training ensembles, validated on synthetic 2D distributions (MOG-4, MOG-8) and high-dimensional φ⁴ lattice field theory, demonstrating effective sampling.

Conclusion: ScoreNF provides an efficient alternative to traditional sampling methods, enabling unbiased sampling from unnormalized distributions with reduced computational cost and addressing mode-related issues.

Abstract: Unnormalized probability distributions are central to modeling complex
physical systems across various scientific domains. Traditional sampling
methods, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), often suffer from slow
convergence, critical slowing down, poor mode mixing, and high autocorrelation.
In contrast, likelihood-based and adversarial machine learning models, though
effective, are heavily data-driven, requiring large datasets and often
encountering mode covering and mode collapse. In this work, we propose ScoreNF,
a score-based learning framework built on the Normalizing Flow (NF)
architecture, integrated with an Independent Metropolis-Hastings (IMH) module,
enabling efficient and unbiased sampling from unnormalized target
distributions. We show that ScoreNF maintains high performance even with small
training ensembles, thereby reducing reliance on computationally expensive
MCMC-generated training data. We also present a method for assessing
mode-covering and mode-collapse behaviours. We validate our method on synthetic
2D distributions (MOG-4 and MOG-8) and the high-dimensional $\phi^4$ lattice
field theory distribution, demonstrating its effectiveness for sampling tasks.

*Sina Molavipour,Alireza M. Javid,Cassie Ye,Björn Löfdahl,Mikhail Nechaev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A neural network framework for robust yield curve estimation in small mortgage bond markets that addresses overfitting and instability issues in traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional yield curve estimation methods like bootstrapping and Nelson-Siegel models struggle with overfitting and instability, especially in sparse, volatile, or noisy bond markets.

Method: Neural network-based framework with a new loss function that enforces smoothness and stability, estimating yield curves independently for each day while allowing integration of domain-specific constraints.

Result: Empirical results on Swedish mortgage bonds show more robust and stable yield curve estimates compared to Nelson-Siegel-Svensson and Kernel-Ridge methods.

Conclusion: The framework provides practitioners with a flexible approach to balance smoothness and accuracy while handling limited and noisy data in small mortgage bond markets.

Abstract: Robust yield curve estimation is crucial in fixed-income markets for accurate
instrument pricing, effective risk management, and informed trading strategies.
Traditional approaches, including the bootstrapping method and parametric
Nelson-Siegel models, often struggle with overfitting or instability issues,
especially when underlying bonds are sparse, bond prices are volatile, or
contain hard-to-remove noise. In this paper, we propose a neural networkbased
framework for robust yield curve estimation tailored to small mortgage bond
markets. Our model estimates the yield curve independently for each day and
introduces a new loss function to enforce smoothness and stability, addressing
challenges associated with limited and noisy data. Empirical results on Swedish
mortgage bonds demonstrate that our approach delivers more robust and stable
yield curve estimates compared to existing methods such as
Nelson-Siegel-Svensson (NSS) and Kernel-Ridge (KR). Furthermore, the framework
allows for the integration of domain-specific constraints, such as alignment
with risk-free benchmarks, enabling practitioners to balance the trade-off
between smoothness and accuracy according to their needs.

*Jens E. d'Hondt,Wieger R. Punter,Odysseas Papapetrou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Generative Correlation Manifolds (GCM) is a computationally efficient method that uses Cholesky decomposition to generate synthetic data preserving the entire correlation structure of source data, including pairwise and higher-order relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current synthetic data generation methods fail to preserve complex correlation structures beyond simple summary statistics, leading to data that appears realistic but fails in sophisticated modeling tasks.

Method: Uses Cholesky decomposition of a target correlation matrix to mathematically guarantee preservation of the entire correlation structure from pairwise to higher-order interactions.

Result: The method produces synthetic datasets that preserve the complete correlation structure of the source data by mathematical proof.

Conclusion: GCM provides a new approach to synthetic data generation with applications in privacy-preserving data sharing, robust model training, and simulation.

Abstract: The increasing need for data privacy and the demand for robust machine
learning models have fueled the development of synthetic data generation
techniques. However, current methods often succeed in replicating simple
summary statistics but fail to preserve both the pairwise and higher-order
correlation structure of the data that define the complex, multi-variable
interactions inherent in real-world systems. This limitation can lead to
synthetic data that is superficially realistic but fails when used for
sophisticated modeling tasks. In this white paper, we introduce Generative
Correlation Manifolds (GCM), a computationally efficient method for generating
synthetic data. The technique uses Cholesky decomposition of a target
correlation matrix to produce datasets that, by mathematical proof, preserve
the entire correlation structure -- from simple pairwise relationships to
higher-order interactions -- of the source dataset. We argue that this method
provides a new approach to synthetic data generation with potential
applications in privacy-preserving data sharing, robust model training, and
simulation.

### [201] [Compositional Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion for Extendable Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21361)
*Jaesik Yoon,Hyeonseo Cho,Sungjin Ahn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: C-MCTD extends Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion by enabling compositional planning across multiple trajectories rather than individual trajectory optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCTD is limited by training trajectory lengths and lacks global context during planning, as it searches within individual trajectories without considering complete plan compositions.

Method: C-MCTD introduces three components: Online Composer for globally-aware planning across entire compositions, Distributed Composer for parallel exploration from multiple starting points, and Preplan Composer for accelerated inference using cached plan graphs.

Result: The framework elevates planning from individual trajectory optimization to reasoning over complete plan compositions, addressing MCTD's limitations.

Conclusion: C-MCTD provides a more comprehensive planning approach that overcomes the local confinement of MCTD through compositional reasoning.

Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) integrates diffusion models with structured
tree search to enable effective trajectory exploration through stepwise
reasoning. However, MCTD remains fundamentally limited by training trajectory
lengths. While periodic replanning allows plan concatenation for longer plan
generation, the planning process remains locally confined, as MCTD searches
within individual trajectories without access to global context. We propose
Compositional Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (C-MCTD), a framework that elevates
planning from individual trajectory optimization to reasoning over complete
plan compositions. C-MCTD introduces three complementary components: (1) Online
Composer, which performs globally-aware planning by searching across entire
plan compositions; (2) Distributed Composer, which reduces search complexity
through parallel exploration from multiple starting points; and (3) Preplan
Composer, which accelerates inference by leveraging cached plan graphs.

### [202] [Few-Shot Knowledge Distillation of LLMs With Counterfactual Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21631)
*Faisal Hamman,Pasan Dissanayake,Yanjun Fu,Sanghamitra Dutta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoD introduces counterfactual explanations for few-shot task-aware knowledge distillation, using CFEs to map teacher's decision boundary with fewer samples and improving student performance with only half the data of baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing task-aware distillation methods require large amounts of data, which is often unavailable or expensive in practical scenarios. CoD addresses this by leveraging counterfactual explanations for few-shot distillation.

Method: Systematically infuses counterfactual explanations (CFEs) - inputs that flip teacher's prediction with minimal perturbation - to precisely map teacher's decision boundary. Provides theoretical guarantees from statistical and geometric perspectives.

Result: CoD outperforms standard distillation approaches in few-shot regimes (8-512 samples) across various datasets and LLMs. Achieves better performance using only half the original samples paired with their CFEs.

Conclusion: Counterfactual explanations effectively act as knowledge probes, helping students mimic teacher's decision boundaries more effectively than standard data in few-shot distillation scenarios.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a promising approach to transfer capabilities from
complex teacher models to smaller, resource-efficient student models that can
be deployed easily, particularly in task-aware scenarios. However, existing
methods of task-aware distillation typically require substantial quantities of
data which may be unavailable or expensive to obtain in many practical
scenarios. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a novel
strategy called Counterfactual-explanation-infused Distillation CoD for
few-shot task-aware knowledge distillation by systematically infusing
counterfactual explanations. Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) refer to inputs
that can flip the output prediction of the teacher model with minimum
perturbation. Our strategy CoD leverages these CFEs to precisely map the
teacher's decision boundary with significantly fewer samples. We provide
theoretical guarantees for motivating the role of CFEs in distillation, from
both statistical and geometric perspectives. We mathematically show that CFEs
can improve parameter estimation by providing more informative examples near
the teacher's decision boundary. We also derive geometric insights on how CFEs
effectively act as knowledge probes, helping the students mimic the teacher's
decision boundaries more effectively than standard data. We perform experiments
across various datasets and LLMs to show that CoD outperforms standard
distillation approaches in few-shot regimes (as low as 8-512 samples). Notably,
CoD only uses half of the original samples used by the baselines, paired with
their corresponding CFEs and still improves performance.

*Zihao Fu,Ryan Brown,Shun Shao,Kai Rawal,Eoin Delaney,Chris Russell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairImagen is a post-hoc debiasing framework that reduces societal biases in text-to-image diffusion models by projecting prompt embeddings into a fair subspace using Fair PCA, without requiring model retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models like Stable Diffusion often replicate and amplify societal biases along demographic attributes such as gender and race, creating inequitable image generation.

Method: Uses Fair Principal Component Analysis to project CLIP-based input embeddings into a subspace that minimizes group-specific information while preserving semantic content, with empirical noise injection and unified cross-demographic projection for multiple attributes.

Result: Significantly improves fairness across gender, race, and intersectional settings with moderate trade-off in image quality and prompt fidelity, outperforming existing post-hoc methods.

Conclusion: FairImagen provides a simple, scalable, and model-agnostic solution for equitable text-to-image generation without requiring model modifications or retraining.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality and diverse images from
natural language prompts. However, recent studies reveal that these models
often replicate and amplify societal biases, particularly along demographic
attributes like gender and race. In this paper, we introduce FairImagen
(https://github.com/fuzihaofzh/FairImagen), a post-hoc debiasing framework that
operates on prompt embeddings to mitigate such biases without retraining or
modifying the underlying diffusion model. Our method integrates Fair Principal
Component Analysis to project CLIP-based input embeddings into a subspace that
minimizes group-specific information while preserving semantic content. We
further enhance debiasing effectiveness through empirical noise injection and
propose a unified cross-demographic projection method that enables simultaneous
debiasing across multiple demographic attributes. Extensive experiments across
gender, race, and intersectional settings demonstrate that FairImagen
significantly improves fairness with a moderate trade-off in image quality and
prompt fidelity. Our framework outperforms existing post-hoc methods and offers
a simple, scalable, and model-agnostic solution for equitable text-to-image
generation.

TL;DR: DEEDEE is a simple but effective OOD detector for RL that uses only episode mean and RBF kernel similarity, achieving comparable performance to complex methods with 600x less compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL deployment in safety-critical settings is constrained by brittleness under distribution shift, requiring effective OOD detection for RL time series.

Method: DEEDEE uses a two-statistic approach: episodewise mean and RBF kernel similarity to training summary, capturing complementary global and local deviations.

Result: DEEDEE matches or surpasses contemporary detectors across standard RL OOD suites, with 600x compute reduction and 5% absolute accuracy gain over baselines.

Conclusion: Diverse anomaly types often imprint on RL trajectories through a small set of low-order statistics, suggesting a compact foundation for OOD detection.

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in safety-critical settings is
constrained by brittleness under distribution shift. We study
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection for RL time series and introduce DEEDEE, a
two-statistic detector that revisits representation-heavy pipelines with a
minimal alternative. DEEDEE uses only an episodewise mean and an RBF kernel
similarity to a training summary, capturing complementary global and local
deviations. Despite its simplicity, DEEDEE matches or surpasses contemporary
detectors across standard RL OOD suites, delivering a 600-fold reduction in
compute (FLOPs / wall-time) and an average 5% absolute accuracy gain over
strong baselines. Conceptually, our results indicate that diverse anomaly types
often imprint on RL trajectories through a small set of low-order statistics,
suggesting a compact foundation for OOD detection in complex environments.

### [205] [Randomized Neural Network with Adaptive Forward Regularization for Online Task-free Class Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21367)
*Junda Wang,Minghui Hu,Ning Li,Abdulaziz Al-Ali,Ponnuthurai Nagaratnam Suganthan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a randomized neural network with forward regularization (edRVFL-kF) for online task-free class incremental learning (OTCIL), addressing non-i.i.d. data streams and catastrophic forgetting through one-pass closed-form updates and variable learning rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve practical problems in class incremental learning: (1) non-i.i.d. batch streams without boundary prompts (OTCIL scenario), and (2) memory loss in long task streams. The goal is efficient decision-making with reduced cumulative regrets.

Method: Proposes edRVFL-kF framework with adjustable forward regularization, generating one-pass closed-form incremental updates and variable learning rates. Also develops edRVFL-kF-Bayes using Bayesian learning to self-adaptively determine regularization parameters.

Result: Experiments on 2 image datasets with 6 metrics show the frameworks effectively avoid past replay and catastrophic forgetting while achieving superior performance. The methods outperform canonical ridge regularization in OTCIL.

Conclusion: The proposed OTCIL frameworks with -kF-Bayes and -kF styles are validated as effective solutions for online task-free class incremental learning, providing efficient forgetting resistance and learning performance enhancement.

Abstract: Class incremental learning (CIL) requires an agent to learn distinct tasks
consecutively with knowledge retention against forgetting. Problems impeding
the practical applications of CIL methods are twofold: (1) non-i.i.d batch
streams and no boundary prompts to update, known as the harsher online
task-free CIL (OTCIL) scenario; (2) CIL methods suffer from memory loss in
learning long task streams, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). To achieve efficient
decision-making and decrease cumulative regrets during the OTCIL process, a
randomized neural network (Randomized NN) with forward regularization (-F) is
proposed to resist forgetting and enhance learning performance. This general
framework integrates unsupervised knowledge into recursive convex optimization,
has no learning dissipation, and can outperform the canonical ridge style (-R)
in OTCIL. Based on this framework, we derive the algorithm of the ensemble deep
random vector functional link network (edRVFL) with adjustable forward
regularization (-kF), where k mediates the intensity of the intervention.
edRVFL-kF generates one-pass closed-form incremental updates and variable
learning rates, effectively avoiding past replay and catastrophic forgetting
while achieving superior performance. Moreover, to curb unstable penalties
caused by non-i.i.d and mitigate intractable tuning of -kF in OTCIL, we improve
it to the plug-and-play edRVFL-kF-Bayes, enabling all hard ks in multiple
sub-learners to be self-adaptively determined based on Bayesian learning.
Experiments were conducted on 2 image datasets including 6 metrics, dynamic
performance, ablation tests, and compatibility, which distinctly validates the
efficacy of our OTCIL frameworks with -kF-Bayes and -kF styles.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A cost-sensitive hyperparameter optimization method using freeze-thaw Bayesian optimization with utility functions to balance computational cost and performance, featuring novel acquisition functions and automatic stopping criteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for early-stopping in HPO when expected performance improvements don't justify additional computational costs, providing better cost-performance trade-offs.

Method: Introduces utility functions in freeze-thaw BO framework, combines with novel acquisition function and stopping criterion, and improves sample efficiency through transfer learning for specialized surrogate models.

Result: Outperforms previous freeze-thaw BO and transfer-BO baselines on established multi-fidelity HPO benchmarks, achieving significantly better cost-performance trade-offs.

Conclusion: The proposed cost-sensitive HPO method effectively balances computational costs and model performance through utility-based optimization and automatic stopping, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of \emph{cost-sensitive} hyperparameter
optimization (HPO) built upon freeze-thaw Bayesian optimization (BO).
Specifically, we assume a scenario where users want to early-stop the HPO
process when the expected performance improvement is not satisfactory with
respect to the additional computational cost. Motivated by this scenario, we
introduce \emph{utility} in the freeze-thaw framework, a function describing
the trade-off between the cost and performance that can be estimated from the
user's preference data. This utility function, combined with our novel
acquisition function and stopping criterion, allows us to dynamically continue
training the configuration that we expect to maximally improve the utility in
the future, and also automatically stop the HPO process around the maximum
utility. Further, we improve the sample efficiency of existing freeze-thaw
methods with transfer learning to develop a specialized surrogate model for the
cost-sensitive HPO problem. We validate our algorithm on established
multi-fidelity HPO benchmarks and show that it outperforms all the previous
freeze-thaw BO and transfer-BO baselines we consider, while achieving a
significantly better trade-off between the cost and performance. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/db-Lee/CFBO.

### [207] [Disentangled Representation Learning via Modular Compositional Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21402)
*Whie Jung,Dong Hoon Lee,Seunghoon Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a compositional bias framework for disentangled representation learning that uses factor-specific mixing strategies instead of modifying objectives or architectures, enabling joint disentanglement of attributes and objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DRL methods require redesigning architectures or objectives for different factors of variation, creating significant overhead when dealing with novel factors or multiple coexisting factors.

Method: Randomly remix latents according to factor-specific rules (mixing strategies) and use two objectives: a prior loss ensuring realistic decoded images, and compositional consistency loss aligning composite images with composite latents.

Result: Competitive performance in both attribute and object disentanglement, and uniquely achieves joint disentanglement of global style and objects without modifying objectives or architectures.

Conclusion: The compositional bias framework provides a flexible approach to disentanglement by simply adjusting mixing strategies, making it adaptable to various factor types without architectural or objective changes.

Abstract: Recent disentangled representation learning (DRL) methods heavily rely on
factor specific strategies-either learning objectives for attributes or model
architectures for objects-to embed inductive biases. Such divergent approaches
result in significant overhead when novel factors of variation do not align
with prior assumptions, such as statistical independence or spatial
exclusivity, or when multiple factors coexist, as practitioners must redesign
architectures or objectives. To address this, we propose a compositional bias,
a modular inductive bias decoupled from both objectives and architectures. Our
key insight is that different factors obey distinct recombination rules in the
data distribution: global attributes are mutually exclusive, e.g., a face has
one nose, while objects share a common support (any subset of objects can
co-exist). We therefore randomly remix latents according to factor-specific
rules, i.e., a mixing strategy, and force the encoder to discover whichever
factor structure the mixing strategy reflects through two complementary
objectives: (i) a prior loss that ensures every remix decodes into a realistic
image, and (ii) the compositional consistency loss introduced by Wiedemer et
al. (arXiv:2310.05327), which aligns each composite image with its
corresponding composite latent. Under this general framework, simply adjusting
the mixing strategy enables disentanglement of attributes, objects, and even
both, without modifying the objectives or architectures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method shows competitive performance in both attribute and
object disentanglement, and uniquely achieves joint disentanglement of global
style and objects. Code is available at

*Guanxiong Luo,Shoujin Huang,Yanlong Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Self-diffusion is a novel framework for solving inverse problems without pretrained generative models, using an iterative noising-denoising process with a randomly initialized self-denoiser network.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional diffusion methods require pretrained models on clean datasets, which limits flexibility. Self-diffusion aims to create a more adaptive approach that works with arbitrary forward operators and noisy observations.

Method: Iterative process alternating between noising and denoising steps. Uses a single untrained convolutional network (self-denoiser) randomly initialized and continuously trained via data fidelity loss. Exploits neural network spectral bias modulated through scheduled noise.

Result: Achieves competitive or superior performance on various linear inverse problems compared to other methods, without relying on pretrained score functions or external denoisers.

Conclusion: Self-diffusion provides a highly flexible and broadly applicable framework for inverse problems that adapts to arbitrary forward operators and noisy observations while maintaining strong performance.

Abstract: We propose self-diffusion, a novel framework for solving inverse problems
without relying on pretrained generative models. Traditional diffusion-based
approaches require training a model on a clean dataset to learn to reverse the
forward noising process. This model is then used to sample clean solutions --
corresponding to posterior sampling from a Bayesian perspective -- that are
consistent with the observed data under a specific task. In contrast,
self-diffusion introduces a self-contained iterative process that alternates
between noising and denoising steps to progressively refine its estimate of the
solution. At each step of self-diffusion, noise is added to the current
estimate, and a self-denoiser, which is a single untrained convolutional
network randomly initialized from scratch, is continuously trained for certain
iterations via a data fidelity loss to predict the solution from the noisy
estimate. Essentially, self-diffusion exploits the spectral bias of neural
networks and modulates it through a scheduled noise process. Without relying on
pretrained score functions or external denoisers, this approach still remains
adaptive to arbitrary forward operators and noisy observations, making it
highly flexible and broadly applicable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on a variety of linear inverse problems, showing that self-diffusion
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to other methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops PIELM (Physics-Informed Extreme Learning Machine) to solve inverse Stefan problems more efficiently than traditional PINNs, achieving 3-7 orders of magnitude higher accuracy and 94% faster training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shortcomings in hyperparameter dependency, training efficiency, and prediction accuracy when solving inverse Stefan problems.

Method: PIELM replaces deep neural networks with extreme learning machine networks, fixes input weights, and determines output weights by optimizing a loss vector of physical laws. It transforms the problem into finding Moore-Penrose generalized inverse using least squares.

Result: PIELM increases prediction accuracy by 3-7 orders of magnitude in relative L2 error and saves more than 94% training time compared to conventional PINNs.

Conclusion: PIELM provides a rapid and accurate physics-informed learning framework for solving inverse Stefan problems, overcoming limitations of traditional PINNs.

Abstract: The inverse Stefan problem, as a typical phase-change problem with moving
boundaries, finds extensive applications in science and engineering. Recent
years have seen the applications of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to
solving Stefan problems, yet they still exhibit shortcomings in hyperparameter
dependency, training efficiency, and prediction accuracy. To address this, this
paper develops a physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM), a rapid
physics-informed learning method framework for inverse Stefan problems. PIELM
replaces conventional deep neural networks with an extreme learning machine
network. The input weights are fixed in the PIELM framework, and the output
weights are determined by optimizing a loss vector of physical laws composed by
initial and boundary conditions and governing partial differential equations
(PDEs). Then, solving inverse Stefan problems is transformed into finding the
Moore-Penrose generalized inverse by the least squares method. Case studies
show that the PIELM can increase the prediction accuracy by 3-7 order of
magnitude in terms of the relative L2 error, and meanwhile saving more than 94%
training time, compared to conventional PINNs.

*Hao Liang,Shuqing Shi,Yudi Zhang,Biwei Huang,Yali Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GSAC is a reinforcement learning framework that combines causal representation learning with meta actor-critic methods to achieve scalability and domain generalization in large networked systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale networked systems like traffic, power, and wireless grids present challenges of both scale and environment shifts that conventional RL methods struggle to handle.

Method: Each agent learns sparse local causal masks to identify minimal neighborhood variables, creating approximately compact representations (ACRs). A meta actor-critic trains shared policies across source domains while conditioning on compact domain factors.

Result: GSAC adapts rapidly with few trajectories at test time and significantly outperforms learning-from-scratch and conventional adaptation baselines.

Conclusion: The framework provides finite-sample guarantees on causal recovery, actor-critic convergence, and adaptation gap, demonstrating effective scalability and domain generalization.

Abstract: Large-scale networked systems, such as traffic, power, and wireless grids,
challenge reinforcement-learning agents with both scale and environment shifts.
To address these challenges, we propose GSAC (Generalizable and Scalable
Actor-Critic), a framework that couples causal representation learning with
meta actor-critic learning to achieve both scalability and domain
generalization. Each agent first learns a sparse local causal mask that
provably identifies the minimal neighborhood variables influencing its
dynamics, yielding exponentially tight approximately compact representations
(ACRs) of state and domain factors. These ACRs bound the error of truncating
value functions to $\kappa$-hop neighborhoods, enabling efficient learning on
graphs. A meta actor-critic then trains a shared policy across multiple source
domains while conditioning on the compact domain factors; at test time, a few
trajectories suffice to estimate the new domain factor and deploy the adapted
policy. We establish finite-sample guarantees on causal recovery, actor-critic
convergence, and adaptation gap, and show that GSAC adapts rapidly and
significantly outperforms learning-from-scratch and conventional adaptation
baselines.

### [211] [Unified token representations for sequential decision models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21448)
*Zhuojing Tian,Yushu Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Unified Token Representation (UTR) that merges return-to-go, state, and action into single tokens, reducing sequence length and computational complexity while maintaining performance in offline RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing transformer-based offline RL methods like Decision Transformer suffer from redundant tokenization and quadratic attention complexity, limiting scalability in real-time or resource-constrained settings.

Method: Developed UTR that combines return-to-go, state, and action into unified tokens, creating two variants: UDT (transformer backbone) and UDC (gated CNN backbone). Theoretical analysis shows tighter Rademacher complexity bound.

Result: Both UDT and UDC achieve comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art methods with significantly lower computational requirements.

Conclusion: UTR generalizes well across architectures and provides an efficient foundation for scalable control in future large decision models.

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated strong potential in offline reinforcement
learning (RL) by modeling trajectories as sequences of return-to-go, states,
and actions. However, existing approaches such as the Decision Transformer(DT)
and its variants suffer from redundant tokenization and quadratic attention
complexity, limiting their scalability in real-time or resource-constrained
settings. To address this, we propose a Unified Token Representation (UTR) that
merges return-to-go, state, and action into a single token, substantially
reducing sequence length and model complexity. Theoretical analysis shows that
UTR leads to a tighter Rademacher complexity bound, suggesting improved
generalization. We further develop two variants: UDT and UDC, built upon
transformer and gated CNN backbones, respectively. Both achieve comparable or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods with markedly lower
computation. These findings demonstrate that UTR generalizes well across
architectures and may provide an efficient foundation for scalable control in
future large decision models.

*Federico Danieli,Pau Rodriguez,Miguel Sarabia,Xavier Suau,Luca Zappella*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ParaRNN enables parallel training of nonlinear RNNs by solving recurrence relations as a system of equations using Newton's iterations and parallel reductions, achieving up to 665x speedup and scaling to 7B parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RNNs are limited by sequential computation, while parallelizable alternatives like Transformers and SSMs have constraints - SSMs are limited by linearity and cannot model complex nonlinear dependencies.

Method: Cast nonlinear recurrence relationships as a single system of equations and solve in parallel using Newton's iterations combined with custom parallel reductions.

Result: Achieved 665x speedup over sequential training, successfully trained 7B parameter LSTM and GRU models with perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and Mamba2 architectures.

Conclusion: ParaRNN breaks the sequence-parallelization barrier for nonlinear RNNs, enabling large-scale training and exploration of new nonlinear RNN models through an open-source framework.

Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) laid the foundation for sequence modeling,
but their intrinsic sequential nature restricts parallel computation, creating
a fundamental barrier to scaling. This has led to the dominance of
parallelizable architectures like Transformers and, more recently, State Space
Models (SSMs). While SSMs achieve efficient parallelization through structured
linear recurrences, this linearity constraint limits their expressive power and
precludes modeling complex, nonlinear sequence-wise dependencies. To address
this, we present ParaRNN, a framework that breaks the sequence-parallelization
barrier for nonlinear RNNs. Building on prior work, we cast the sequence of
nonlinear recurrence relationships as a single system of equations, which we
solve in parallel using Newton's iterations combined with custom parallel
reductions. Our implementation achieves speedups of up to 665x over naive
sequential application, allowing training nonlinear RNNs at unprecedented
scales. To showcase this, we apply ParaRNN to adaptations of LSTM and GRU
architectures, successfully training models of 7B parameters that attain
perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and Mamba2 architectures.
To accelerate research in efficient sequence modeling, we release the ParaRNN
codebase as an open-source framework for automatic training-parallelization of
nonlinear RNNs, enabling researchers and practitioners to explore new nonlinear
RNN models at scale.

*Jorge Díez,Pablo Pérez-Núñez,Oscar Luaces,Beatriz Remeseiro,Antonio Bahamonde*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes learning personalized explanations as recommendations by predicting what photos users would take to justify their opinions about items, using a formal framework to estimate authorship probability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explaining recommender system outputs is crucial for user trust and company insights. Users often upload photos to reinforce their opinions, so predicting these photos can provide convincing explanations.

Method: Developed a formal framework to estimate authorship probability for user-photo pairs. Used TripAdvisor data containing restaurant reviews with photos from six cities to illustrate the approach.

Result: The method can predict which photos users would take to justify their opinions, providing personalized explanations for recommendations and insights into what aspects customers highlight about products.

Conclusion: Recommender systems can explain their results by predicting user-generated photos, increasing reliability and providing companies with valuable insights about customer perspectives on their products.

Abstract: Explaining the output of a complex system, such as a Recommender System (RS),
is becoming of utmost importance for both users and companies. In this paper we
explore the idea that personalized explanations can be learned as
recommendation themselves. There are plenty of online services where users can
upload some photos, in addition to rating items. We assume that users take
these photos to reinforce or justify their opinions about the items. For this
reason we try to predict what photo a user would take of an item, because that
image is the argument that can best convince her of the qualities of the item.
In this sense, an RS can explain its results and, therefore, increase its
reliability. Furthermore, once we have a model to predict attractive images for
users, we can estimate their distribution. Thus, the companies acquire a vivid
knowledge about the aspects that the clients highlight of their products. The
paper includes a formal framework that estimates the authorship probability for
a given pair (user, photo). To illustrate the proposal, we use data gathered
from TripAdvisor containing the reviews (with photos) of restaurants in six
cities of different sizes.

*Daan Caljon,Jente Van Belle,Wouter Verbeke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HINet is a novel method that combines graph neural networks with domain adversarial training to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects in network settings, addressing unknown exposure mappings and network-level covariate shift caused by homophily.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing causal ML approaches assume known exposure mappings and don't address network-level covariate shift from homophily-treatment interactions, leading to inaccurate treatment effect estimates in network settings with interference.

Method: Integrates graph neural networks with domain adversarial training to estimate treatment effects under unknown exposure mappings while mitigating network-level covariate shift.

Result: Extensive empirical evaluation on synthetic and semi-synthetic network datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed HINet approach.

Conclusion: HINet successfully addresses key challenges in network causal inference by handling unknown exposure mappings and network-level covariate shift through GNNs and domain adversarial training.

Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in network settings is complicated
by interference, meaning that the outcome of an instance can be influenced by
the treatment status of others. Existing causal machine learning approaches
usually assume a known exposure mapping that summarizes how the outcome of a
given instance is influenced by others' treatment, a simplification that is
often unrealistic. Furthermore, the interaction between homophily -- the
tendency of similar instances to connect -- and the treatment assignment
mechanism can induce a network-level covariate shift that may lead to
inaccurate treatment effect estimates, a phenomenon that has not yet been
explicitly studied. To address these challenges, we propose HINet, a novel
method that integrates graph neural networks with domain adversarial training.
This combination allows estimating treatment effects under unknown exposure
mappings while mitigating the impact of (network-level) covariate shift. An
extensive empirical evaluation on synthetic and semi-synthetic network datasets
demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: ZEN is a parameter-free hypergraph neural network that achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot node classification while being highly efficient and interpretable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hypergraph neural networks suffer from overfitting and scalability issues due to complex architectures, especially in few-shot learning scenarios with scarce labels.

Method: Proposes ZEN - a fully linear, parameter-free model with a closed-form solution for weight matrix and redundancy-aware propagation scheme to avoid iterative training.

Result: Outperforms 8 baseline models on 11 real-world hypergraph benchmarks with up to 696x speedups over the fastest competitor, while providing full interpretability.

Conclusion: ZEN demonstrates that parameter-free, linear models can achieve superior performance and efficiency in hypergraph learning while maintaining interpretability.

Abstract: Few-shot node classification on hypergraphs requires models that generalize
from scarce labels while capturing high-order structures. Existing hypergraph
neural networks (HNNs) effectively encode such structures but often suffer from
overfitting and scalability issues due to complex, black-box architectures. In
this work, we propose ZEN (Zero-Parameter Hypergraph Neural Network), a fully
linear and parameter-free model that achieves both expressiveness and
efficiency. Built upon a unified formulation of linearized HNNs, ZEN introduces
a tractable closed-form solution for the weight matrix and a redundancy-aware
propagation scheme to avoid iterative training and to eliminate redundant self
information. On 11 real-world hypergraph benchmarks, ZEN consistently
outperforms eight baseline models in classification accuracy while achieving up
to 696x speedups over the fastest competitor. Moreover, the decision process of
ZEN is fully interpretable, providing insights into the characteristic of a
dataset. Our code and datasets are fully available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Catastrophic forgetting remains a major challenge in continual learning, particularly in federated learning environments with non-i.i.d. time series data.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting (CF) poses a persistent challenge in continual

characterized by non-i.i.d. time series data. While existing research has
largely focused on classification tasks in vision domains, the regression-based

underexplored. In this paper, we present the first benchmarking framework
tailored to investigate CF in federated continual time series forecasting.
Using the Beijing Multi-site Air Quality dataset across 12 decentralized

### [217] [Uniform Convergence Beyond Glivenko-Cantelli](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21506)
*Tanmay Devale,Pramith Devulapalli,Steve Hanneke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper extends uniform convergence theory beyond empirical mean estimators, introducing Uniform Mean Estimability (UME-learnability) and showing separability of mean vectors is sufficient but not necessary for UME-learnability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize the Vapnik-Chervonenkis framework by moving beyond empirical mean estimators and characterize when collections of distributions permit uniform mean estimation by any arbitrary estimator.

Method: Work on the space of mean vectors of distributions, analyze separability conditions, and construct counterexamples using different techniques to show separability is not necessary.

Result: Separability of mean vectors is sufficient for UME-learnability but not necessary, and countable unions of UME-learnable collections are also UME-learnable.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a more general framework for uniform mean estimation, resolves the relationship between separability and UME-learnability, and proves closure properties under countable unions.

Abstract: We characterize conditions under which collections of distributions on
$\{0,1\}^\mathbb{N}$ admit uniform estimation of their mean. Prior work from
Vapnik and Chervonenkis (1971) has focused on uniform convergence using the
empirical mean estimator, leading to the principle known as $P-$
Glivenko-Cantelli. We extend this framework by moving beyond the empirical mean
estimator and introducing Uniform Mean Estimability, also called $UME-$
learnability, which captures when a collection permits uniform mean estimation
by any arbitrary estimator. We work on the space created by the mean vectors of
the collection of distributions. For each distribution, the mean vector records
the expected value in each coordinate. We show that separability of the mean
vectors is a sufficient condition for $UME-$ learnability. However, we show
that separability of the mean vectors is not necessary for $UME-$ learnability
by constructing a collection of distributions whose mean vectors are
non-separable yet $UME-$ learnable using techniques fundamentally different
from those used in our separability-based analysis. Finally, we establish that
countable unions of $UME-$ learnable collections are also $UME-$ learnable,
solving a conjecture posed in Cohen et al. (2025).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to quantify epistemic uncertainty in generative flow networks by using polynomial chaos expansion to create a surrogate model that maps reward functions to policy distributions, enabling inexpensive uncertainty estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward functions in generative flow networks are often estimated from noisy data, leading to epistemic uncertainty in the learnt policy that needs to be quantified.

Method: Construct a surrogate model using polynomial chaos expansion fit on a small ensemble of trained flow networks, learning the relationship between reward functions and probability distributions over actions.

Result: The surrogate model enables inexpensive Monte Carlo sampling to estimate policy uncertainty given uncertain rewards, demonstrated on discrete/continuous grid-worlds, symbolic regression, and Bayesian structure learning.

Conclusion: The approach effectively quantifies epistemic uncertainty in generative flow networks through polynomial chaos expansion-based surrogate modeling.

Abstract: Generative flow networks are able to sample, via sequential construction,
high-reward, complex objects according to a reward function. However, such
reward functions are often estimated approximately from noisy data, leading to
epistemic uncertainty in the learnt policy. We present an approach to quantify
this uncertainty by constructing a surrogate model composed of a polynomial
chaos expansion, fit on a small ensemble of trained flow networks. This model
learns the relationship between reward functions, parametrised in a
low-dimensional space, and the probability distributions over actions at each
step along a trajectory of the flow network. The surrogate model can then be
used for inexpensive Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the uncertainty in the
policy given uncertain rewards. We illustrate the performance of our approach
on a discrete and continuous grid-world, symbolic regression, and a Bayesian
structure learning task.

### [219] [A Unified Model for Multi-Task Drone Routing in Post-Disaster Road Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21525)
*Huatian Gong,Jiuh-Biing Sheu,Zheng Wang,Xiaoguang Yang,Ran Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified deep reinforcement learning model for drone routing in post-disaster road assessment that handles eight problem variants simultaneously, reducing training time and parameters by 8x while outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-disaster road assessment requires rapid drone routing, but traditional optimization scales poorly and existing deep learning approaches lack adaptability to different problem variants and evolving operational needs.

Method: Uses a transformer encoder-decoder architecture trained across multiple problem configurations, with a lightweight adapter mechanism for efficient finetuning to unseen attributes without retraining.

Result: Reduces training time and parameters by 8x compared to separate models, outperforms single-task DRL by 6-14% and traditional optimization by 24-82% in solution quality, achieves real-time solutions for networks up to 1,000 nodes.

Conclusion: The unified model advances neural combinatorial optimization for time-critical applications, offering computationally efficient, high-quality, and adaptable drone routing for post-disaster assessment.

Abstract: Post-disaster road assessment (PDRA) is essential for emergency response,
enabling rapid evaluation of infrastructure conditions and efficient allocation
of resources. Although drones provide a flexible and effective tool for PDRA,
routing them in large-scale networks remains challenging. Traditional
optimization methods scale poorly and demand domain expertise, while existing
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches adopt a single-task paradigm,
requiring separate models for each problem variant and lacking adaptability to
evolving operational needs. This study proposes a unified model (UM) for drone
routing that simultaneously addresses eight PDRA variants. By training a single
neural network across multiple problem configurations, UM captures shared
structural knowledge while adapting to variant-specific constraints through a
modern transformer encoder-decoder architecture. A lightweight adapter
mechanism further enables efficient finetuning to unseen attributes without
retraining, enhancing deployment flexibility in dynamic disaster scenarios.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the UM reduces training time and
parameters by a factor of eight compared with training separate models, while
consistently outperforming single-task DRL methods by 6--14\% and traditional
optimization approaches by 24--82\% in terms of solution quality (total
collected information value). The model achieves real-time solutions (1--10
seconds) across networks of up to 1,000 nodes, with robustness confirmed
through sensitivity analyses. Moreover, finetuning experiments show that unseen
attributes can be effectively incorporated with minimal cost while retaining
high solution quality. The proposed UM advances neural combinatorial
optimization for time-critical applications, offering a computationally
efficient, high-quality, and adaptable solution for drone-based PDRA.

### [220] [Probe-based Fine-tuning for Reducing Toxicity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21531)
*Jan Wehner,Mario Fritz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Training against interpretability probes may reduce their reliability due to Goodhart's Law, but probe-based preference optimization surprisingly preserves detectability better than classifier methods, and retraining probes after optimization recovers accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Probes can detect undesirable behaviors like deception or biases that are hard to identify from outputs alone, making them valuable both as detectors and training signals for good internal processes. However, using them as training targets raises concerns about reliability loss.

Method: Proposed two methods based on Supervised Fine-tuning and Direct Preference Optimization, tested in a toxicity reduction testbed. Evaluated probe accuracy drops and tested three approaches to retain accuracy: training against probe ensembles, retaining held-out probes, and retraining new probes after training.

Result: Probe-based preference optimization preserves detectability better than classifier methods, suggesting it incentivizes maintaining rather than obfuscating representations. Probe diversity provides minimal benefit - simply retraining probes after optimization recovers high detection accuracy.

Conclusion: Probe-based training can be viable for certain alignment methods, but probe ensembles are largely unnecessary when retraining is feasible.

Abstract: Probes trained on model activations can detect undesirable behaviors like
deception or biases that are difficult to identify from outputs alone. This
makes them useful detectors to identify misbehavior. Furthermore, they are also
valuable training signals, since they not only reward outputs, but also good
internal processes for arriving at that output. However, training against
interpretability tools raises a fundamental concern: when a monitor becomes a
training target, it may cease to be reliable (Goodhart's Law). We propose two
methods for training against probes based on Supervised Fine-tuning and Direct
Preference Optimization. We conduct an initial exploration of these methods in
a testbed for reducing toxicity and evaluate the amount by which probe accuracy
drops when training against them. To retain the accuracy of probe-detectors
after training, we attempt (1) to train against an ensemble of probes, (2)
retain held-out probes that aren't used for training, and (3) retrain new
probes after training.
  First, probe-based preference optimization unexpectedly preserves probe
detectability better than classifier-based methods, suggesting the preference
learning objective incentivizes maintaining rather than obfuscating relevant
representations. Second, probe diversity provides minimal practical benefit -
simply retraining probes after optimization recovers high detection accuracy.
Our findings suggest probe-based training can be viable for certain alignment
methods, though probe ensembles are largely unnecessary when retraining is
feasible.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Spatiotemporal Region Distortion (SRD), a pseudo-anomaly generation method that creates synthetic anomalies with precise annotations to enable effective adversarial training for Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection (WSVAD) models, significantly improving their robustness against adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing WSVAD models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and traditional adversarial defense mechanisms are ineffective due to weak video-level supervision. Pseudo-labels enable frame-level training but are too noisy, degrading performance.

Method: Proposed Spatiotemporal Region Distortion (SRD) method that generates synthetic anomalies by applying severe augmentations to localized regions in normal videos while maintaining temporal consistency. These precisely annotated synthetic anomalies are combined with noisy pseudo-labels to reduce label noise.

Result: The method significantly enhances WSVAD model robustness, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by an average of 71.0% in overall AUROC performance across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: The SRD approach enables effective adversarial training for WSVAD by reducing label noise through synthetic anomaly generation, substantially improving model robustness against adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection (WSVAD) has achieved notable
advancements, yet existing models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
limiting their reliability. Due to the inherent constraints of weak
supervision, where only video-level labels are provided despite the need for
frame-level predictions, traditional adversarial defense mechanisms, such as
adversarial training, are not effective since video-level adversarial
perturbations are typically weak and inadequate. To address this limitation,
pseudo-labels generated directly from the model can enable frame-level
adversarial training; however, these pseudo-labels are inherently noisy,
significantly degrading performance. We therefore introduce a novel
Pseudo-Anomaly Generation method called Spatiotemporal Region Distortion (SRD),
which creates synthetic anomalies by applying severe augmentations to localized
regions in normal videos while preserving temporal consistency. Integrating
these precisely annotated synthetic anomalies with the noisy pseudo-labels
substantially reduces label noise, enabling effective adversarial training.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the
robustness of WSVAD models against adversarial attacks, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods by an average of 71.0\% in overall AUROC performance
across multiple benchmarks. The implementation and code are publicly available

### [222] [Excision Score: Evaluating Edits with Surgical Precision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21537)
*Nikolai Gruzinov,Ksenia Sycheva,Earl T. Barr,Alex Bezzubov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Excision Score (ES), a novel similarity measure for document revisions that addresses limitations of existing measures like BLEU by focusing only on changed content rather than shared content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pairwise similarity measures like BLEU fail to properly evaluate document revisions because they are dominated by shared content, reporting high similarity even when humans would judge revisions as quite different.

Method: Proposes Excision Score (ES) which uses longest common subsequence (LCS) to remove content shared between the original document and revisions, then compares only the remaining divergent regions. Uses approximation to speed up LCS computation from cubic to quadratic time.

Result: ES significantly outperforms existing measures in code-editing evaluation, improving Pearson correlation by 12% over SARI and >21% over standard measures like BLEU on HumanEvalFix. When shared context increases, ES's improvement grows to 20% over SARI and >30% over standard measures.

Conclusion: ES is a more effective revision similarity measure that properly handles shared context, aligns with human judgment, and addresses corner cases like moved code blocks and insertions/deletions that other measures fail to handle correctly.

Abstract: Many tasks revolve around editing a document, whether code or text. We
formulate the revision similarity problem to unify a wide range of machine
learning evaluation problems whose goal is to assess a revision to an existing
document. We observe that revisions usually change only a small portion of an
existing document, so the existing document and its immediate revisions share a
majority of their content. We formulate five adequacy criteria for revision
similarity measures, designed to align them with human judgement. We show that
popular pairwise measures, like BLEU, fail to meet these criteria, because
their scores are dominated by the shared content. They report high similarity
between two revisions when humans would assess them as quite different. This is
a fundamental flaw we address. We propose a novel static measure, Excision
Score (ES), which computes longest common subsequence (LCS) to remove content
shared by an existing document with the ground truth and predicted revisions,
before comparing only the remaining divergent regions. This is analogous to a
surgeon creating a sterile field to focus on the work area. We use
approximation to speed the standard cubic LCS computation to quadratic. In
code-editing evaluation, where static measures are often used as a cheap proxy
for passing tests, we demonstrate that ES surpasses existing measures. When
aligned with test execution on HumanEvalFix, ES improves over its nearest
competitor, SARI, by 12% Pearson correlation and by >21% over standard measures
like BLEU. The key criterion is invariance to shared context; when we perturb
HumanEvalFix with increased shared context, ES' improvement over SARI increases
to 20% and >30% over standard measures. ES also handles other corner cases that
other measures do not, such as correctly aligning moved code blocks, and
appropriately rewarding matching insertions or deletions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated ECG interpretation systems struggle with transparency and generalization to unseen conditions, creating a need for more interpretable and trustworthy AI diagnostic systems aligned with clinical workflows.

Method: Uses a pre-trained multimodal model to align ECG and text embeddings, compares ECG signals against structured positive/negative clinical observations curated through LLM-assisted expert validation, mimicking differential diagnosis without disease-specific fine-tuning.

Result: Demonstrates competitive zero-shot classification performance with enhanced interpretability, grounding predictions in specific clinically relevant positive and negative diagnostic features.

Conclusion: ZETA shows the potential of aligning ECG analysis with structured clinical knowledge for building more transparent, generalizable, and trustworthy AI diagnostic systems.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation is essential for cardiovascular
disease diagnosis, but current automated systems often struggle with
transparency and generalization to unseen conditions. To address this, we
introduce ZETA, a zero-shot multimodal framework designed for interpretable ECG
diagnosis aligned with clinical workflows. ZETA uniquely compares ECG signals
against structured positive and negative clinical observations, which are
curated through an LLM-assisted, expert-validated process, thereby mimicking
differential diagnosis. Our approach leverages a pre-trained multimodal model
to align ECG and text embeddings without disease-specific fine-tuning.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate ZETA's competitive zero-shot classification
performance and, importantly, provide qualitative and quantitative evidence of
enhanced interpretability, grounding predictions in specific, clinically
relevant positive and negative diagnostic features. ZETA underscores the
potential of aligning ECG analysis with structured clinical knowledge for
building more transparent, generalizable, and trustworthy AI diagnostic
systems. We will release the curated observation dataset and code to facilitate
future research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Pretraining Graph Neural Networks on classical algorithms improves molecular property prediction performance by providing useful inductive biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks struggle with out-of-distribution generalization while classical algorithms guarantee correctness but lack flexibility. The paper explores whether combining these approaches can enhance GNN performance on molecular prediction tasks.

Method: GNNs were pretrained on 24 classical algorithms from the CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark, then used to initialize and freeze selected layers of a second GNN for molecular property prediction on Open Graph Benchmark datasets (ogbg-molhiv and ogbg-molclintox).

Result: Pretrained models consistently outperformed randomly initialized baselines, with Segments Intersect algorithm pretraining achieving 6% absolute gain on HIV inhibition prediction and Dijkstra pretraining achieving 3% gain on clinical toxicity prediction.

Conclusion: Embedding classical algorithmic priors into GNNs provides useful inductive biases that boost performance on complex, real-world graph data.

Abstract: Neural networks excel at processing unstructured data but often fail to
generalise out-of-distribution, whereas classical algorithms guarantee
correctness but lack flexibility. We explore whether pretraining Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) on classical algorithms can improve their performance on
molecular property prediction tasks from the Open Graph Benchmark: ogbg-molhiv
(HIV inhibition) and ogbg-molclintox (clinical toxicity). GNNs trained on 24
classical algorithms from the CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark are used to
initialise and freeze selected layers of a second GNN for molecular prediction.
Compared to a randomly initialised baseline, the pretrained models achieve
consistent wins or ties, with the Segments Intersect algorithm pretraining
yielding a 6% absolute gain on ogbg-molhiv and Dijkstra pretraining achieving a
3% gain on ogbg-molclintox. These results demonstrate embedding classical
algorithmic priors into GNNs provides useful inductive biases, boosting
performance on complex, real-world graph data.

### [225] [An unsupervised tour through the hidden pathways of deep neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21582)
*Diego Doimo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This thesis develops unsupervised methods to understand how deep neural networks create meaningful representations and generalize. It introduces Gride for intrinsic dimension estimation, analyzes probability density evolution across layers showing hierarchical semantic structure, and explains generalization through redundant representations in wide networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve understanding of the internal mechanisms by which deep neural networks create meaningful representations and generalize, particularly focusing on characterizing semantic content of hidden representations using unsupervised learning tools.

Method: Developed Gride method for intrinsic dimension estimation without data decimation; studied probability density evolution across hidden layers in state-of-the-art networks; analyzed generalization in wide neural networks with redundant representations.

Result: Initial layers generate unimodal probability density removing irrelevant structure; subsequent layers create hierarchical density peaks mirroring semantic hierarchy; wide networks learn redundant representations instead of overfitting when regularized with zero training error.

Conclusion: Deep neural networks create hierarchical semantic representations through probability density evolution, and generalization improves through redundant representations in wide networks rather than classical bias-variance trade-off.

Abstract: The goal of this thesis is to improve our understanding of the internal
mechanisms by which deep artificial neural networks create meaningful
representations and are able to generalize. We focus on the challenge of
characterizing the semantic content of the hidden representations with
unsupervised learning tools, partially developed by us and described in this
thesis, which allow harnessing the low-dimensional structure of the data.
Chapter 2. introduces Gride, a method that allows estimating the intrinsic
dimension of the data as an explicit function of the scale without performing
any decimation of the data set. Our approach is based on rigorous
distributional results that enable the quantification of uncertainty of the
estimates. Moreover, our method is simple and computationally efficient since
it relies only on the distances among nearest data points. In Chapter 3, we
study the evolution of the probability density across the hidden layers in some
state-of-the-art deep neural networks. We find that the initial layers generate
a unimodal probability density getting rid of any structure irrelevant to
classification. In subsequent layers, density peaks arise in a hierarchical
fashion that mirrors the semantic hierarchy of the concepts. This process
leaves a footprint in the probability density of the output layer, where the
topography of the peaks allows reconstructing the semantic relationships of the
categories. In Chapter 4, we study the problem of generalization in deep neural
networks: adding parameters to a network that interpolates its training data
will typically improve its generalization performance, at odds with the
classical bias-variance trade-off. We show that wide neural networks learn
redundant representations instead of overfitting to spurious correlation and
that redundant neurons appear only if the network is regularized and the
training error is zero.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: REVE is an EEG foundation model that addresses dataset heterogeneity through 4D positional encoding and masked autoencoding, achieving SOTA results on 10 EEG tasks with strong generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models have been successful in language and vision but lag in EEG due to dataset heterogeneity from varying protocols, devices, and electrode configurations, limiting generalization.

Method: Introduces 4D positional encoding for arbitrary EEG signal length and electrode arrangement, pretrained with masked autoencoding on 60,000+ hours from 92 datasets across 25,000 subjects.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 10 downstream EEG tasks including motor imagery, seizure detection, sleep staging, cognitive load, and emotion recognition with little to no fine-tuning.

Conclusion: REVE enables standardized EEG research with strong generalization and nuanced spatio-temporal modeling, accelerating progress in clinical neuroscience.

Abstract: Foundation models have transformed AI by reducing reliance on task-specific
data through large-scale pretraining. While successful in language and vision,
their adoption in EEG has lagged due to the heterogeneity of public datasets,
which are collected under varying protocols, devices, and electrode
configurations. Existing EEG foundation models struggle to generalize across
these variations, often restricting pretraining to a single setup, resulting in
suboptimal performance, in particular under linear probing. We present REVE
(Representation for EEG with Versatile Embeddings), a pretrained model
explicitly designed to generalize across diverse EEG signals. REVE introduces a
novel 4D positional encoding scheme that enables it to process signals of
arbitrary length and electrode arrangement. Using a masked autoencoding
objective, we pretrain REVE on over 60,000 hours of EEG data from 92 datasets
spanning 25,000 subjects, representing the largest EEG pretraining effort to
date. REVE achieves state-of-the-art results on 10 downstream EEG tasks,
including motor imagery classification, seizure detection, sleep staging,
cognitive load estimation, and emotion recognition. With little to no
fine-tuning, it demonstrates strong generalization, and nuanced spatio-temporal
modeling. We release code, pretrained weights, and tutorials to support
standardized EEG research and accelerate progress in clinical neuroscience.

*Lei Liu,Zhenxin Huang,Hong Wang,huanshuo dong,Haiyang Xin,Hongwei Zhao,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HOPSS is a novel data generation algorithm that creates training datasets for neural operators with fewer time steps, reducing computational overhead while maintaining precision by combining base solutions with homologous perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for generating training data for neural operators require thousands of time steps, creating heavy computational and temporal overheads that limit practical applications.

Method: HOPSS algorithm: 1) Obtain base solutions from reliable solver with thousands of time steps and downsample to align with training datasets, 2) Apply homologous perturbation by combining two solution functions (primary + scaled homologous term) with random noise, 3) Compute RHS variations to form new solution pairs.

Result: HOPSS significantly reduces time complexity - generates 10,000 samples in approximately 10% of traditional methods' time for Navier-Stokes equation, with comparable model training performance.

Conclusion: HOPSS provides an efficient alternative to traditional data generation methods for neural operators, accelerating dataset creation while preserving training precision through homologous perturbation in solution space.

Abstract: Data-driven deep learning methods like neural operators have advanced in
solving nonlinear temporal partial differential equations (PDEs). However,
these methods require large quantities of solution pairs\u2014the solution
functions and right-hand sides (RHS) of the equations. These pairs are
typically generated via traditional numerical methods, which need thousands of
time steps iterations far more than the dozens required for training, creating
heavy computational and temporal overheads. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel data generation algorithm, called HOmologous Perturbation in
Solution Space (HOPSS), which directly generates training datasets with fewer
time steps rather than following the traditional approach of generating large
time steps datasets. This algorithm simultaneously accelerates dataset
generation and preserves the approximate precision required for model training.
Specifically, we first obtain a set of base solution functions from a reliable
solver, usually with thousands of time steps, and then align them in time steps
with training datasets by downsampling. Subsequently, we propose a "homologous
perturbation" approach: by combining two solution functions (one as the primary
function, the other as a homologous perturbation term scaled by a small scalar)
with random noise, we efficiently generate comparable-precision PDE data
points. Finally, using these data points, we compute the variation in the
original equation's RHS to form new solution pairs. Theoretical and
experimental results show HOPSS lowers time complexity. For example, on the
Navier-Stokes equation, it generates 10,000 samples in approximately 10% of
traditional methods' time, with comparable model training performance.

*Reda Marzouk,Shahaf Bassan,Guy Katz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents efficient algorithms for computing exact SHAP explanations for Tensor Networks, showing poly-logarithmic time complexity for Tensor Train structures and identifying network width as the primary computational bottleneck.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SHAP explanations are NP-hard to compute for expressive black-box models like neural networks, but are crucial for model interpretability. Tensor Networks offer a more expressive class of models where efficient SHAP computation might be possible.

Method: The authors introduce a general framework for computing exact SHAP explanations for arbitrary Tensor Network structures. For Tensor Train structures specifically, they develop algorithms that achieve poly-logarithmic time complexity using parallel computation.

Result: SHAP computation can be performed in poly-logarithmic time for Tensor Train structures. This result extends to various ML models including decision trees, tree ensembles, linear models, and linear RNNs. For binarized neural networks, SHAP becomes tractable when width is fixed but remains hard with constant depth.

Conclusion: Network width, rather than depth, is the primary computational bottleneck for SHAP computation in this class of models. The work tightens complexity bounds for several popular ML models and provides efficient exact SHAP algorithms for Tensor Networks.

Abstract: Although Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) can be computed in polynomial
time for simple models like decision trees, they unfortunately become NP-hard
to compute for more expressive black-box models like neural networks - where
generating explanations is often most critical. In this work, we analyze the
problem of computing SHAP explanations for *Tensor Networks (TNs)*, a broader
and more expressive class of models than those for which current exact SHAP
algorithms are known to hold, and which is widely used for neural network
abstraction and compression. First, we introduce a general framework for
computing provably exact SHAP explanations for general TNs with arbitrary
structures. Interestingly, we show that, when TNs are restricted to a *Tensor
Train (TT)* structure, SHAP computation can be performed in *poly-logarithmic*
time using *parallel* computation. Thanks to the expressiveness power of TTs,
this complexity result can be generalized to many other popular ML models such
as decision trees, tree ensembles, linear models, and linear RNNs, therefore
tightening previously reported complexity results for these families of models.
Finally, by leveraging reductions of binarized neural networks to Tensor
Network representations, we demonstrate that SHAP computation can become
*efficiently tractable* when the network's *width* is fixed, while it remains
computationally hard even with constant *depth*. This highlights an important
insight: for this class of models, width - rather than depth - emerges as the
primary computational bottleneck in SHAP computation.

*Oscar Davis,Michael S. Albergo,Nicholas M. Boffi,Michael M. Bronstein,Avishek Joey Bose*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GFM is a new class of few-step generative models that extends Flow Map framework from Euclidean spaces to Riemannian manifolds, achieving state-of-the-art sample quality with minimal inference steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current geometric generative models are computationally expensive at inference due to complex numerical simulation steps derived from dynamical measure transport frameworks on Riemannian manifolds.

Method: Proposed Generalised Flow Maps (GFM) with three self-distillation-based training methods: Generalised Lagrangian Flow Maps, Generalised Eulerian Flow Maps, and Generalised Progressive Flow Maps.

Result: GFMs achieve state-of-the-art sample quality for single- and few-step evaluations, and superior or competitive log-likelihoods using implicit probability flow on geometric datasets including geospatial data, RNA torsion angles, and hyperbolic manifolds.

Conclusion: GFMs unify and elevate existing Euclidean few-step generative models to Riemannian setting, providing efficient inference while maintaining high sample quality.

Abstract: Geometric data and purpose-built generative models on them have become
ubiquitous in high-impact deep learning application domains, ranging from
protein backbone generation and computational chemistry to geospatial data.
Current geometric generative models remain computationally expensive at
inference -- requiring many steps of complex numerical simulation -- as they
are derived from dynamical measure transport frameworks such as diffusion and
flow-matching on Riemannian manifolds. In this paper, we propose Generalised
Flow Maps (GFM), a new class of few-step generative models that generalises the
Flow Map framework in Euclidean spaces to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. We
instantiate GFMs with three self-distillation-based training methods:
Generalised Lagrangian Flow Maps, Generalised Eulerian Flow Maps, and
Generalised Progressive Flow Maps. We theoretically show that GFMs, under
specific design decisions, unify and elevate existing Euclidean few-step
generative models, such as consistency models, shortcut models, and meanflows,
to the Riemannian setting. We benchmark GFMs against other geometric generative
models on a suite of geometric datasets, including geospatial data, RNA torsion
angles, and hyperbolic manifolds, and achieve state-of-the-art sample quality
for single- and few-step evaluations, and superior or competitive
log-likelihoods using the implicit probability flow.

*Maximilien Dreveton,Elaine Siyu Liu,Matthias Grossglauser,Patrick Thiran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper establishes theoretical limits for graph clustering under the Popularity-Adjusted Block Model (PABM), showing it captures degree heterogeneity better than existing models and enables cluster recovery even when edge-density signals vanish, provided intra- and inter-cluster popularity coefficients differ.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of existing graph clustering models like SBM and DCBM, which assume uniform vertex degrees or apply uniform degree corrections across clusters, by introducing PABM with separate popularity parameters for intra- and inter-cluster connections.

Method: Characterizes the optimal error rate for clustering under PABM, analyzes the model's theoretical properties, and conducts numerical experiments on synthetic and real datasets comparing spectral clustering algorithms using k vs k² eigenvectors.

Result: Shows that cluster recovery remains possible in PABM even when traditional edge-density signals vanish, and that spectral embeddings using k² eigenvectors outperform traditional approaches using only k eigenvectors due to PABM's richer structure.

Conclusion: PABM captures a dimension of degree heterogeneity overlooked by DCBM, where local connectivity pattern differences can enhance cluster separability independently of global edge densities, requiring spectral methods that incorporate more eigenvectors to capture the model's full structure.

Abstract: This paper establishes the theoretical limits of graph clustering under the
Popularity-Adjusted Block Model (PABM), addressing limitations of existing
models. In contrast to the Stochastic Block Model (SBM), which assumes uniform
vertex degrees, and to the Degree-Corrected Block Model (DCBM), which applies
uniform degree corrections across clusters, PABM introduces separate popularity
parameters for intra- and inter-cluster connections. Our main contribution is
the characterization of the optimal error rate for clustering under PABM, which
provides novel insights on clustering hardness: we demonstrate that unlike SBM
and DCBM, cluster recovery remains possible in PABM even when traditional
edge-density signals vanish, provided intra- and inter-cluster popularity
coefficients differ. This highlights a dimension of degree heterogeneity
captured by PABM but overlooked by DCBM: local differences in connectivity
patterns can enhance cluster separability independently of global edge
densities. Finally, because PABM exhibits a richer structure, its expected
adjacency matrix has rank between $k$ and $k^2$, where $k$ is the number of
clusters. As a result, spectral embeddings based on the top $k$ eigenvectors
may fail to capture important structural information. Our numerical experiments
on both synthetic and real datasets confirm that spectral clustering algorithms
incorporating $k^2$ eigenvectors outperform traditional spectral approaches.

*Edward Berman,Jacob Ginesin,Marco Pacini,Robin Walters*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents the first theoretical framework connecting equivariance with uncertainty estimation and model calibration, proving bounds on calibration errors for equivariant models and showing how symmetry mismatch causes miscalibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data-sparse domains like robotic manipulation and molecular physics are challenging for deep learning. While equivariant networks help with undersampled data and uncertainty estimation guards against overconfidence, the relationship between equivariance and model calibration has not been studied.

Method: Developed theoretical bounds on uncertainty calibration errors (ECE and ENCE) under various equivariance conditions, complemented by numerical experiments on real and simulated datasets to analyze symmetry mismatch, group size, and different uncertainty types.

Result: Proved that equivariance affects model calibration through demonstrated bounds on calibration errors, showing how symmetry mismatch leads to miscalibration in both classification and regression tasks.

Conclusion: The work establishes fundamental connections between equivariance and uncertainty estimation, providing theoretical understanding of how symmetry properties influence model calibration and generalization limits in data-sparse domains.

Abstract: Data-sparse settings such as robotic manipulation, molecular physics, and
galaxy morphology classification are some of the hardest domains for deep
learning. For these problems, equivariant networks can help improve modeling
across undersampled parts of the input space, and uncertainty estimation can
guard against overconfidence. However, until now, the relationships between
equivariance and model confidence, and more generally equivariance and model
calibration, has yet to be studied. Since traditional classification and
regression error terms show up in the definitions of calibration error, it is
natural to suspect that previous work can be used to help understand the
relationship between equivariance and calibration error. In this work, we
present a theory relating equivariance to uncertainty estimation. By proving
lower and upper bounds on uncertainty calibration errors (ECE and ENCE) under
various equivariance conditions, we elucidate the generalization limits of
equivariant models and illustrate how symmetry mismatch can result in
miscalibration in both classification and regression. We complement our
theoretical framework with numerical experiments that clarify the relationship
between equivariance and uncertainty using a variety of real and simulated
datasets, and we comment on trends with symmetry mismatch, group size, and
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties.

TL;DR: This paper applies sparse autoencoders to interpret a Transformer-based TSP solver, revealing that neural networks naturally learn geometric features like boundary detectors and cluster-sensitive features without explicit supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural TSP solvers operate as black boxes, providing no insight into the geometric patterns they learn or the heuristics they employ. The authors aim to address this opacity using mechanistic interpretability techniques.

Method: Trained a pointer network with reinforcement learning on 100-node TSP instances, then fitted sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to the encoder's residual stream to discover an overcomplete dictionary of interpretable features.

Result: The analysis revealed that the solver naturally develops features mirroring fundamental TSP concepts: boundary detectors for convex-hull nodes, cluster-sensitive features for dense regions, and separator features for geometric partitions.

Conclusion: This provides the first model-internal account of what neural TSP solvers compute, demonstrates that geometric structure emerges without supervision, and suggests pathways for transparent hybrid systems combining neural efficiency with algorithmic interpretability.

Abstract: Neural networks have advanced combinatorial optimization, with
Transformer-based solvers achieving near-optimal solutions on the Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP) in milliseconds. However, these models operate as black
boxes, providing no insight into the geometric patterns they learn or the
heuristics they employ during tour construction. We address this opacity by
applying sparse autoencoders (SAEs), a mechanistic interpretability technique,
to a Transformer-based TSP solver, representing the first application of
activation-based interpretability methods to operations research models. We
train a pointer network with reinforcement learning on 100-node instances, then
fit an SAE to the encoder's residual stream to discover an overcomplete
dictionary of interpretable features. Our analysis reveals that the solver
naturally develops features mirroring fundamental TSP concepts: boundary
detectors that activate on convex-hull nodes, cluster-sensitive features
responding to locally dense regions, and separator features encoding geometric
partitions. These findings provide the first model-internal account of what
neural TSP solvers compute before node selection, demonstrate that geometric
structure emerges without explicit supervision, and suggest pathways toward
transparent hybrid systems that combine neural efficiency with algorithmic
interpretability. Interactive feature explorer:

TL;DR: EbC learns equivariant embeddings from observation pairs by jointly learning a latent space and group representation without group-specific biases, validated on finite groups and non-abelian groups with theoretical identifiability proof.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To learn equivariant embeddings from observation pairs without relying on group-specific inductive biases, enabling general-purpose encoder-only equivariant learning from group action observations alone.

Method: Proposes Equivariance by Contrast (EbC) that jointly learns a latent space and group representation where group actions correspond to invertible linear maps, using observation pairs (y, g·y) with g drawn from a finite group.

Result: Achieves high-fidelity equivariance with group operations faithfully reproduced in latent space, validated on finite group G:=(R_m × ℤ_n × ℤ_n) and non-abelian groups O(n) and GL(n) on synthetic data.

Conclusion: First successful demonstration of general-purpose encoder-only equivariant learning from group action observations alone, including non-trivial non-abelian groups and product groups for modeling affine equivariances in computer vision.

Abstract: We propose Equivariance by Contrast (EbC) to learn equivariant embeddings
from observation pairs $(\mathbf{y}, g \cdot \mathbf{y})$, where $g$ is drawn
from a finite group acting on the data. Our method jointly learns a latent
space and a group representation in which group actions correspond to
invertible linear maps -- without relying on group-specific inductive biases.
We validate our approach on the infinite dSprites dataset with structured
transformations defined by the finite group $G:= (R_m \times \mathbb{Z}_n
\times \mathbb{Z}_n)$, combining discrete rotations and periodic translations.
The resulting embeddings exhibit high-fidelity equivariance, with group
operations faithfully reproduced in latent space. On synthetic data, we further
validate the approach on the non-abelian orthogonal group $O(n)$ and the
general linear group $GL(n)$. We also provide a theoretical proof for
identifiability. While broad evaluation across diverse group types on
real-world data remains future work, our results constitute the first
successful demonstration of general-purpose encoder-only equivariant learning
from group action observations alone, including non-trivial non-abelian groups
and a product group motivated by modeling affine equivariances in computer
vision.
