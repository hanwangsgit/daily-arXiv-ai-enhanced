### [1] [Enhancing Maritime Object Detection in Real-Time with RT-DETR and Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07346)
*Nader Nemati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Real-time maritime object detection system using RT-DETR enhanced with synthetic data augmentation, multi-scale feature fusion, and domain adaptation strategies to address small target detection challenges in maritime environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maritime object detection faces challenges due to small target sizes and limited labeled real RGB data, requiring robust solutions for practical applications.

Method: Uses RT-DETR with multi-scale feature fusion for small vessel detection, uncertainty-minimizing query selection, smart weighting between synthetic and real training samples, and data augmentation for class balancing.

Result: Delivers a full Python robust maritime detection pipeline maintaining real-time performance, with component analysis quantifying each module's contribution and system performance under extreme conditions.

Conclusion: The system preserves DETR's end-to-end set prediction while allowing speed-accuracy trade-offs, successfully handling maritime detection challenges through integrated architectural improvements.

Abstract: Maritime object detection faces essential challenges due to the small target
size and limitations of labeled real RGB data. This paper will present a
real-time object detection system based on RT-DETR, enhanced by employing
augmented synthetic images while strictly evaluating on real data. This study
employs RT-DETR for the maritime environment by combining multi-scale feature
fusion, uncertainty-minimizing query selection, and smart weight between
synthetic and real training samples. The fusion module in DETR enhances the
detection of small, low-contrast vessels, query selection focuses on the most
reliable proposals, and the weighting strategy helps reduce the visual gap
between synthetic and real domains. This design preserves DETR's refined
end-to-end set prediction while allowing users to adjust between speed and
accuracy at inference time. Data augmentation techniques were also used to
balance the different classes of the dataset to improve the robustness and
accuracy of the model. Regarding this study, a full Python robust maritime
detection pipeline is delivered that maintains real-time performance even under
practical limits. It also verifies how each module contributes, and how the
system handles failures in extreme lighting or sea conditions. This study also
includes a component analysis to quantify the contribution of each
architectural module and explore its interactions.

### [2] [DynamicEval: Rethinking Evaluation for Dynamic Text-to-Video Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07441)
*Nithin C. Babu,Aniruddha Mahapatra,Harsh Rangwani,Rajiv Soundararajan,Kuldeep Kulkarni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DynamicEval is a new text-to-video evaluation benchmark that addresses limitations in existing benchmarks by focusing on dynamic camera motion and providing video-level evaluation with 45k human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2V evaluation benchmarks like VBench and EvalCrafter focus on static camera scenes and subject-centric prompts, overlooking dynamic camera motion essential for cinematic shots. They also aggregate scores at model level, missing video-level evaluation needed to select better videos for specific prompts.

Method: Created DynamicEval benchmark with curated prompts emphasizing dynamic camera motion, collected 45k human annotations on 3k videos from 10 T2V models. Proposed two new metrics: background scene consistency metric using object error maps to correct Vbench motion smoothness failures, and foreground consistency metric that tracks points within object instances.

Result: The proposed metrics achieve stronger correlations with human preferences at both video level and model level, with improvements of more than 2% points compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: DynamicEval establishes a more comprehensive benchmark for evaluating T2V models under dynamic camera motion, addressing key gaps in existing evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: Existing text-to-video (T2V) evaluation benchmarks, such as VBench and
EvalCrafter, suffer from two limitations. (i) While the emphasis is on
subject-centric prompts or static camera scenes, camera motion essential for
producing cinematic shots and existing metrics under dynamic motion are largely
unexplored. (ii) These benchmarks typically aggregate video-level scores into a
single model-level score for ranking generative models. Such aggregation,
however, overlook video-level evaluation, which is vital to selecting the
better video among the candidate videos generated for a given prompt. To
address these gaps, we introduce DynamicEval, a benchmark consisting of
systematically curated prompts emphasizing dynamic camera motion, paired with
45k human annotations on video pairs from 3k videos generated by ten T2V
models. DynamicEval evaluates two key dimensions of video quality: background
scene consistency and foreground object consistency. For background scene
consistency, we obtain the interpretable error maps based on the Vbench motion
smoothness metric. We observe that while the Vbench motion smoothness metric
shows promising alignment with human judgments, it fails in two cases:
occlusions/disocclusions arising from camera and foreground object movements.
Building on this, we propose a new background consistency metric that leverages
object error maps to correct two failure cases in a principled manner. Our
second innovation is the introduction of a foreground consistency metric that
tracks points and their neighbors within each object instance to assess object
fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed metrics achieve
stronger correlations with human preferences at both the video level and the
model level (an improvement of more than 2% points), establishing DynamicEval
as a more comprehensive benchmark for evaluating T2V models under dynamic
camera motion.

### [3] [Provably Accelerated Imaging with Restarted Inertia and Score-based Image Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07470)
*Marien Renaud,Julien Hermant,Deliang Wei,Yu Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RISP is a principled extension of RED that combines restarting inertia for fast convergence with score-based image priors for high-quality reconstruction, achieving faster stationary-point convergence rates than RED without requiring convex priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between sophisticated image priors for quality reconstruction and principled convergence acceleration methods, rather than relying on heuristics.

Method: Restarted Inertia with Score-based Priors (RISP) incorporates restarting inertia for fast convergence while allowing score-based image priors for reconstruction, with theoretical analysis connecting it to heavy-ball ODEs.

Result: RISP attains faster stationary-point convergence rate than RED without requiring convexity of image prior, and experiments across imaging inverse problems demonstrate fast convergence with high-quality reconstructions.

Conclusion: RISP provides a principled framework that enables both fast convergence and high-quality image recovery in ill-posed imaging inverse problems.

Abstract: Fast convergence and high-quality image recovery are two essential features
of algorithms for solving ill-posed imaging inverse problems. Existing methods,
such as regularization by denoising (RED), often focus on designing
sophisticated image priors to improve reconstruction quality, while leaving
convergence acceleration to heuristics. To bridge the gap, we propose Restarted
Inertia with Score-based Priors (RISP) as a principled extension of RED. RISP
incorporates a restarting inertia for fast convergence, while still allowing
score-based image priors for high-quality reconstruction. We prove that RISP
attains a faster stationary-point convergence rate than RED, without requiring
the convexity of the image prior. We further derive and analyze the associated
continuous-time dynamical system, offering insight into the connection between
RISP and the heavy-ball ordinary differential equation (ODE). Experiments
across a range of imaging inverse problems demonstrate that RISP enables fast
convergence while achieving high-quality reconstructions.

### [4] [A Denoising Framework for Real-World Ultra-Low Dose Lung CT Images Based on an Image Purification Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07492)
*Guoliang Gong,Man Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an Image Purification strategy and Frequency-domain Flow Matching model to address spatial misalignment in ultra-low dose CT denoising, achieving state-of-the-art structure preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultra-low dose CT reduces radiation exposure but introduces severe noise, artifacts, and spatial misalignment with normal dose CT, making existing denoising methods ineffective on real clinical data.

Method: Developed Image Purification strategy to generate structurally aligned uLDCT-NDCT pairs, and Frequency-domain Flow Matching model that preserves anatomical structure integrity through frequency-domain processing.

Result: IP strategy significantly enhanced multiple denoising models' performance on uLDCT task. FFM model with IP strategy achieved state-of-the-art results in anatomical structure preservation on real clinical lung dataset.

Conclusion: Provides effective solution to data mismatch problem in real-world uLDCT denoising, with code and dataset publicly available.

Abstract: Ultra-low dose CT (uLDCT) significantly reduces radiation exposure but
introduces severe noise and artifacts. It also leads to substantial spatial
misalignment between uLDCT and normal dose CT (NDCT) image pairs. This poses
challenges for directly applying existing denoising networks trained on
synthetic noise or aligned data. To address this core challenge in uLDCT
denoising, this paper proposes an innovative denoising framework based on an
Image Purification (IP) strategy. First, we construct a real clinical uLDCT
lung dataset. Then, we propose an Image Purification strategy that generates
structurally aligned uLDCT-NDCT image pairs, providing a high-quality data
foundation for network training. Building upon this, we propose a
Frequency-domain Flow Matching (FFM) model, which works synergistically with
the IP strategy to excellently preserve the anatomical structure integrity of
denoised images. Experiments on the real clinical dataset demonstrate that our
IP strategy significantly enhances the performance of multiple mainstream
denoising models on the uLDCT task. Notably, our proposed FFM model combined
with the IP strategy achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in anatomical
structure preservation. This study provides an effective solution to the data
mismatch problem in real-world uLDCT denoising. Code and dataset are available

### [5] [D2RA: Dual Domain Regeneration Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07538)
*Pragati Shuddhodhan Meshram,Varun Chandrasekaran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D2RA is a training-free, single-image attack that removes or weakens watermarks from generative model outputs without needing access to the underlying model, revealing vulnerabilities in current semantic watermarking schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current semantic watermarking methods for generative models are claimed to be robust but remain vulnerable even under resource-constrained adversarial settings, highlighting the need to test their actual security.

Method: D2RA projects watermarked images onto natural priors across complementary representations to suppress watermark signals while preserving visual fidelity, requiring no training or model access.

Result: Experiments show D2RA consistently reduces watermark detectability across diverse watermarking schemes, demonstrating fundamental weaknesses in current watermark designs.

Conclusion: The research reveals that existing semantic watermarking methods have significant vulnerabilities that can be exploited with simple, resource-efficient attacks, calling for more robust watermarking designs.

Abstract: The growing use of generative models has intensified the need for
watermarking methods that ensure content attribution and provenance. While
recent semantic watermarking schemes improve robustness by embedding signals in
latent or frequency representations, we show they remain vulnerable even under
resource-constrained adversarial settings. We present D2RA, a training-free,
single-image attack that removes or weakens watermarks without access to the
underlying model. By projecting watermarked images onto natural priors across
complementary representations, D2RA suppresses watermark signals while
preserving visual fidelity. Experiments across diverse watermarking schemes
demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces watermark detectability,
revealing fundamental weaknesses in current designs. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Pragati-Meshram/DAWN.

### [6] [PickStyle: Video-to-Video Style Transfer with Context-Style Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07546)
*Soroush Mehraban,Vida Adeli,Jacob Rommann,Babak Taati,Kyryl Truskovskyi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PickStyle is a video-to-video style transfer framework that uses diffusion models with style adapters and synthetic training from paired image data, achieving superior temporal coherence and style transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of paired video data for supervision in video style transfer tasks motivates the need for alternative training approaches that can leverage available still image data.

Method: Uses pretrained video diffusion backbones with low-rank style adapters in self-attention layers, constructs synthetic training clips from paired images with shared augmentations, and introduces Context-Style Classifier-Free Guidance (CS-CFG) for independent control over context and style.

Result: Achieves temporally coherent, style-faithful, and content-preserving video translations that outperform existing baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively across benchmarks.

Conclusion: PickStyle effectively bridges the gap between static image supervision and dynamic video style transfer through adapter-based specialization and novel guidance techniques.

Abstract: We address the task of video style transfer with diffusion models, where the
goal is to preserve the context of an input video while rendering it in a
target style specified by a text prompt. A major challenge is the lack of
paired video data for supervision. We propose PickStyle, a video-to-video style
transfer framework that augments pretrained video diffusion backbones with
style adapters and benefits from paired still image data with source-style
correspondences for training. PickStyle inserts low-rank adapters into the
self-attention layers of conditioning modules, enabling efficient
specialization for motion-style transfer while maintaining strong alignment
between video content and style. To bridge the gap between static image
supervision and dynamic video, we construct synthetic training clips from
paired images by applying shared augmentations that simulate camera motion,
ensuring temporal priors are preserved. In addition, we introduce Context-Style
Classifier-Free Guidance (CS-CFG), a novel factorization of classifier-free
guidance into independent text (style) and video (context) directions. CS-CFG
ensures that context is preserved in generated video while the style is
effectively transferred. Experiments across benchmarks show that our approach
achieves temporally coherent, style-faithful, and content-preserving video
translations, outperforming existing baselines both qualitatively and
quantitatively.

### [7] [TRAVL: A Recipe for Making Video-Language Models Better Judges of Physics Implausibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07550)
*Saman Motamed,Minghao Chen,Luc Van Gool,Iro Laina*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Researchers developed TRAVL, a fine-tuning method for Video-Language Models to better detect physical implausibilities in videos, and created ImplausiBench benchmark to evaluate physical reasoning in multimodal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern video generative models often produce sequences that violate physical laws, but there's no robust method to quantitatively assess physical realism. Existing VLMs struggle with temporal and causal reasoning needed to detect physics violations.

Method: Introduced TRAVL - a fine-tuning recipe combining balanced training dataset with trajectory-aware attention module to improve motion encoding and discrimination in VLMs. Created ImplausiBench benchmark with 300 videos (150 real, 150 generated) to isolate visual-temporal understanding.

Result: The approach offers improved capability for VLMs to detect physical implausibilities like floating objects, teleportation, and morphing that defy causality.

Conclusion: TRAVL and ImplausiBench provide a unified framework for probing and improving physical plausibility in multimodal models, addressing a challenging aspect of visual-temporal understanding.

Abstract: Despite impressive visual fidelity, modern video generative models frequently
produce sequences that violate intuitive physical laws, such as objects
floating, teleporting, or morphing in ways that defy causality. While humans
can easily detect such implausibilities, there remains no robust method for
quantitatively assessing physical realism in video. In this work, we explore
whether Video-Language Models (VLMs) can be trained to serve as reliable judges
of physical plausibility. We find that existing VLMs struggle to identify
physics violations, exposing fundamental limitations in their temporal and
causal reasoning. To address this, we introduce TRAVL, a fine-tuning recipe
that combines a balanced training dataset with a trajectory-aware attention
module to improve motion encoding and discrimination in VLMs. To evaluate
physical reasoning more rigorously, we propose ImplausiBench, a benchmark of
300 videos (150 real, 150 generated) that removes linguistic biases and
isolates visual-temporal understanding. Performance is reported both with
gold-standard human judgments and stricter LLM-as-judge metrics. Together,
TRAVL and ImplausiBench offer a unified framework for probing and improving
physical plausibility in multimodal models, shedding light on a challenging and
underexplored aspect of visual-temporal understanding.

### [8] [Label Semantics for Robust Hyperspectral Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07556)
*Rafin Hassan,Zarin Tasnim Roshni,Rafiqul Bari,Alimul Islam,Nabeel Mohammed,Moshiur Farazi,Shafin Rahman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes S3FN, a semantic spectral-spatial fusion network that uses LLM-generated textual descriptions to enhance HSI classification by improving feature-label alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HSI classification faces challenges with limited training samples, high dimensionality causing overfitting, and monomodal approaches relying only on spectral-spatial data without leveraging semantic information.

Method: Uses LLMs to generate class-specific textual descriptions, embeds them using pre-trained text encoders (BERT/RoBERTa), and fuses these semantic embeddings with spectral-spatial features for better classification.

Result: Significant performance boost demonstrated on three HSI benchmark datasets (Hyperspectral Wood, HyperspectralBlueberries, DeepHS-Fruit), showing synergy between textual semantics and spectral-spatial data.

Conclusion: The approach paves the way for semantically augmented HSI classification models by effectively combining textual context with spectral-spatial information.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) classification is a critical tool with widespread
applications across diverse fields such as agriculture, environmental
monitoring, medicine, and materials science. Due to the limited availability of
high-quality training samples and the high dimensionality of spectral data, HSI
classification models are prone to overfitting and often face challenges in
balancing accuracy and computational complexity. Furthermore, most of HSI
classification models are monomodal, where it solely relies on spectral-spatial
data to learn decision boundaries in the high dimensional embedding space. To
address this, we propose a general-purpose Semantic Spectral-Spatial Fusion
Network (S3FN) that uses contextual, class specific textual descriptions to
complement the training of an HSI classification model. Specifically, S3FN
leverages LLMs to generate comprehensive textual descriptions for each class
label that captures their unique characteristics and spectral behaviors. These
descriptions are then embedded into a vector space using a pre-trained text
encoder such as BERT or RoBERTa to extract meaningful label semantics which in
turn leads to a better feature-label alignment for improved classification
performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate our
model on three diverse HSI benchmark datasets - Hyperspectral Wood,
HyperspectralBlueberries, and DeepHS-Fruit and report significant performance
boost. Our results highlight the synergy between textual semantics and
spectral-spatial data, paving the way for further advancements in semantically
augmented HSI classification models. Codes are be available in:

### [9] [Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07567)
*Karuna Bhaila,Aneesh Komanduri,Minh-Hao Van,Xintao Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAGUL is a lightweight unlearning framework for vision-language models that prevents leakage of sensitive information by transforming visual tokens using cross-modal attention, without altering pre-trained model parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs may memorize and regurgitate private/sensitive information from training data during inference, and existing unlearning methods for LLMs don't address the complexity of visual context containing sensitive information.

Method: CAGUL utilizes cross-modal attention to identify visual tokens of low importance for relevant queries, then uses external modules to encode unlearning information into these tokens, preventing leakage while retaining model behavior.

Result: CAGUL performs better or on par with finetuning-based baselines without changing pre-trained model parameters or requiring retraining, making it practical and effective for VLM unlearning.

Conclusion: The proposed CAGUL framework provides an efficient and practical solution for vision-language model unlearning that prevents sensitive information leakage while maintaining model performance, avoiding the computational costs of traditional finetuning approaches.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated immense capabilities in
multi-modal understanding and inference tasks such as Visual Question Answering
(VQA), which requires models to infer outputs based on visual and textual
context simultaneously. Such inference abilities of large-scale pretrained
models are often attributed to the massive scale of pre-training data collected
across several domains. However, the models may memorize private and/or
sensitive information during training and regurgitate it in inference.
Recently, machine unlearning has been leveraged to address the leakage of
private data in LLMs. VLMs add a layer of complexity to this process, as the
visual context in the query may also contain sensitive information in addition
to the text. To address this issue, we explore unlearning for vision-language
models, specifically for the VQA task. We explore the role of visual tokens for
output generation in VLMs using cross-modal attention and utilize it to
formulate Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning (CAGUL), a lightweight and
efficient VLM unlearning framework. In contrast to computationally expensive
model finetuning methods, CAGUL utilizes external modules to encode unlearning
information in visual tokens of low importance for relevant queries. We find
that the transformed visual tokens not only prevent leakage but also retain
reference model behavior. Experimental results show that our method performs
better or on par with finetuning-based baselines without altering the
pre-trained model parameters or incurring retraining costs, making it a
practical and effective unlearning solution for VLMs.

*Dewi Endah Kharismawati,Toni Kazic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MaSC is an automated maize stand counting algorithm using UAV imagery and YOLOv9 detection, achieving high accuracy (R²=0.906) and real-time processing capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual maize stand counting is labor-intensive, slow, and error-prone, especially for large fields, creating a need for automated solutions to support crop management and research.

Method: Uses RGB imagery from low-cost UAVs processed on affordable hardware with two modes: mosaic image patches and raw video frames aligned via homography. Employs lightweight YOLOv9 model to detect maize seedlings (V2-V10 stages) and distinguishes them from weeds, followed by row and range segmentation.

Result: Strong agreement with ground truth manual counts (R²=0.616 for mosaics, R²=0.906 for raw frames). Processed 83 full-resolution frames in 60.63 seconds including inference and post-processing, demonstrating real-time capability.

Conclusion: MaSC is an effective, scalable, low-cost, and accurate tool for automated maize stand counting suitable for both research and production environments.

Abstract: Accurate maize stand counts are essential for crop management and research,
informing yield prediction, planting density optimization, and early detection
of germination issues. Manual counting is labor-intensive, slow, and
error-prone, especially across large or variable fields. We present
MaizeStandCounting (MaSC), a robust algorithm for automated maize seedling
stand counting from RGB imagery captured by low-cost UAVs and processed on
affordable hardware. MaSC operates in two modes: (1) mosaic images divided into
patches, and (2) raw video frames aligned using homography matrices. Both modes
use a lightweight YOLOv9 model trained to detect maize seedlings from V2-V10
growth stages. MaSC distinguishes maize from weeds and other vegetation, then
performs row and range segmentation based on the spatial distribution of
detections to produce precise row-wise stand counts. Evaluation against
in-field manual counts from our 2024 summer nursery showed strong agreement
with ground truth (R^2= 0.616 for mosaics, R^2 = 0.906 for raw frames). MaSC
processed 83 full-resolution frames in 60.63 s, including inference and
post-processing, highlighting its potential for real-time operation. These
results demonstrate MaSC's effectiveness as a scalable, low-cost, and accurate
tool for automated maize stand counting in both research and production
environments.

### [11] [Quick-CapsNet (QCN): A fast alternative to Capsule Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07600)
*Pouya Shiri,Ramin Sharifi,Amirali Baniasadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Quick-CapsNet (QCN) is proposed as a faster alternative to Capsule Networks, achieving 5x faster inference with minimal accuracy loss by reducing the number of capsules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CapsNet has slow training and testing speeds, which limits its use in real-time applications requiring fast inference.

Method: QCN reduces the number of capsules in the network to speed up computation, and also enhances performance by using a more powerful decoder.

Result: QCN achieves 5x faster inference on MNIST, F-MNIST, SVHN, and Cifar-10 datasets with only marginal accuracy loss compared to standard CapsNet.

Conclusion: QCN provides a fast alternative to CapsNet suitable for real-time applications, with the trade-off of slightly reduced accuracy for significant speed improvements.

Abstract: The basic computational unit in Capsule Network (CapsNet) is a capsule (vs.
neurons in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)). A capsule is a set of
neurons, which form a vector. CapsNet is used for supervised classification of
data and has achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on MNIST digit recognition
dataset, outperforming conventional CNNs in detecting overlapping digits.
Moreover, CapsNet shows higher robustness towards affine transformation when
compared to CNNs for MNIST datasets. One of the drawbacks of CapsNet, however,
is slow training and testing. This can be a bottleneck for applications that
require a fast network, especially during inference. In this work, we introduce
Quick-CapsNet (QCN) as a fast alternative to CapsNet, which can be a starting
point to develop CapsNet for fast real-time applications. QCN builds on
producing a fewer number of capsules, which results in a faster network. QCN
achieves this at the cost of marginal loss in accuracy. Inference is 5x faster
on MNIST, F-MNIST, SVHN and Cifar-10 datasets. We also further enhanced QCN by
employing a more powerful decoder instead of the default decoder to further
improve QCN.

### [12] [Rectified-CFG++ for Flow Based Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07631)
*Shreshth Saini,Shashank Gupta,Alan C. Bovik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rectified-CFG++ is an adaptive predictor-corrector guidance method that addresses off-manifold drift issues in classifier-free guidance for rectified flow models, ensuring stable and high-quality text-to-image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard classifier-free guidance (CFG) causes severe off-manifold drift when applied to rectified flow models, leading to visual artifacts, text misalignment, and brittle behavior.

Method: Uses an adaptive predictor-corrector approach: first executes a conditional rectified flow update to anchor samples near the learned transport path, then applies a weighted conditional correction that interpolates between conditional and unconditional velocity fields.

Result: Proves marginal consistency and bounded trajectories within a tubular neighborhood of the data manifold. Outperforms standard CFG on large-scale text-to-image models (Flux, SD3/3.5, Lumina) across MS-COCO, LAION-Aesthetic, and T2I-CompBench benchmarks.

Conclusion: Rectified-CFG++ successfully combines deterministic efficiency of rectified flows with geometry-aware conditioning, ensuring stable performance across guidance strengths while maintaining high-quality text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is the workhorse for steering large diffusion
models toward text-conditioned targets, yet its native application to rectified
flow (RF) based models provokes severe off-manifold drift, yielding visual
artifacts, text misalignment, and brittle behaviour. We present
Rectified-CFG++, an adaptive predictor-corrector guidance that couples the
deterministic efficiency of rectified flows with a geometry-aware conditioning
rule. Each inference step first executes a conditional RF update that anchors
the sample near the learned transport path, then applies a weighted conditional
correction that interpolates between conditional and unconditional velocity
fields. We prove that the resulting velocity field is marginally consistent and
that its trajectories remain within a bounded tubular neighbourhood of the data
manifold, ensuring stability across a wide range of guidance strengths.
Extensive experiments on large-scale text-to-image models (Flux, Stable
Diffusion 3/3.5, Lumina) show that Rectified-CFG++ consistently outperforms
standard CFG on benchmark datasets such as MS-COCO, LAION-Aesthetic, and
T2I-CompBench. Project page: https://rectified-cfgpp.github.io/

*Shashank Gupta,Gregoire Phillips,Alan C. Bovik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PIT-QMM is a novel Large Multimodal Model for No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment that combines text, images, and point clouds to predict quality scores, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with fewer training iterations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Multimodal Models have advanced image and video quality assessment but haven't been fully explored for 3D assets. The authors want to leverage these models for automatic perceptual quality evaluation of point clouds without reference data.

Method: The method constructs PIT-QMM, a novel LMM that consumes text descriptions, 2D projections, and 3D point cloud views end-to-end to predict quality scores, leveraging complementary information from different data modalities.

Result: Extensive experiments show the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on popular benchmarks with fewer training iterations. The framework also enables distortion localization and identification.

Conclusion: PIT-QMM paves a new way forward for model explainability and interactivity in point cloud quality assessment, demonstrating the effectiveness of multimodal approaches for 3D quality evaluation.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have recently enabled considerable advances in
the realm of image and video quality assessment, but this progress has yet to
be fully explored in the domain of 3D assets. We are interested in using these
models to conduct No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment (NR-PCQA), where
the aim is to automatically evaluate the perceptual quality of a point cloud in
absence of a reference. We begin with the observation that different modalities
of data - text descriptions, 2D projections, and 3D point cloud views - provide
complementary information about point cloud quality. We then construct PIT-QMM,
a novel LMM for NR-PCQA that is capable of consuming text, images and point
clouds end-to-end to predict quality scores. Extensive experimentation shows
that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art by significant
margins on popular benchmarks with fewer training iterations. We also
demonstrate that our framework enables distortion localization and
identification, which paves a new way forward for model explainability and
interactivity. Code and datasets are available at

*Harshala Gammulle,Clinton Fookes,Sridha Sridharan,Simon Denman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DSA Net is a dual-stream network that combines frame-wise and action-wise features using quantum-classical fusion for improved action segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing action segmentation methods are mostly single-stream, focusing only on spatio-temporal aspects. Recent research shows potential in two-stream approaches that learn action-wise features to enhance segmentation performance.

Method: Proposed Dual-Stream Alignment Network (DSA Net) with Temporal Context block using cross-attention and Quantum-based Action-Guided Modulation (Q-ActGM) for feature fusion. Uses Dual-Stream Alignment Loss with relational consistency, cross-level contrastive, and cycle-consistency reconstruction losses.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on GTEA, Breakfast, 50Salads, and EgoProcel datasets. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate effectiveness of each component.

Conclusion: DSA Net successfully incorporates dual-stream learning with quantum-classical fusion for action segmentation, significantly outperforming existing methods and establishing a new hybrid quantum-classical framework for this task.

Abstract: Action segmentation is a challenging yet active research area that involves
identifying when and where specific actions occur in continuous video streams.
Most existing work has focused on single-stream approaches that model the
spatio- temporal aspects of frame sequences. However, recent research has
shifted toward two-stream methods that learn action-wise features to enhance
action segmentation performance. In this work, we propose the Dual-Stream
Alignment Network (DSA Net) and investigate the impact of incorporating a
second stream of learned action features to guide segmentation by capturing
both action and action-transition cues. Communication between the two streams
is facilitated by a Temporal Context (TC) block, which fuses complementary
information using cross- attention and Quantum-based Action-Guided Modulation
(Q- ActGM), enhancing the expressive power of the fused features. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first study to introduce a hybrid
quantum-classical machine learning framework for action segmentation. Our
primary objective is for the two streams (frame-wise and action-wise) to learn
a shared feature space through feature alignment. This is encouraged by the
proposed Dual-Stream Alignment Loss, which comprises three components:
relational consistency, cross-level contrastive, and cycle-consistency
reconstruction losses. Following prior work, we evaluate DSA Net on several
diverse benchmark datasets: GTEA, Breakfast, 50Salads, and EgoProcel. We
further demonstrate the effectiveness of each component through extensive
ablation studies. Notably, DSA Net achieves state-of-the-art performance,
significantly outperforming existing

*Yanjie Pan,Qingdong He,Lidong Wang,Bo Peng,Mingmin Chi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OIE is a video virtual try-on method that replaces clothing only in the first frame using an image model, then uses pose and mask guidance to generate remaining frames sequentially, avoiding complex dual-branch architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dual-branch architectures for video virtual try-on require modifying backbone networks and have many parameters, plus garment features lack temporal characteristics requiring additional learning.

Method: Use image-based clothing transfer for first frame replacement, then leverage pose and mask information to guide video generation model in synthesizing remaining frames under content control of the edited first frame.

Result: Achieves superior parameter efficiency and computational efficiency while maintaining leading performance under constraints.

Conclusion: The OIE approach provides an efficient alternative to complex dual-branch architectures for video virtual try-on by focusing on first-frame replacement and sequential generation.

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to replace the clothing of a person in a video with
a target garment. Current dual-branch architectures have achieved significant
success in diffusion models based on the U-Net; however, adapting them to
diffusion models built upon the Diffusion Transformer remains challenging.
Initially, introducing latent space features from the garment reference branch
requires adding or modifying the backbone network, leading to a large number of
trainable parameters. Subsequently, the latent space features of garments lack
inherent temporal characteristics and thus require additional learning. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, OIE (Once is Enough), a
virtual try-on strategy based on first-frame clothing replacement:
specifically, we employ an image-based clothing transfer model to replace the
clothing in the initial frame, and then, under the content control of the
edited first frame, utilize pose and mask information to guide the temporal
prior of the video generation model in synthesizing the remaining frames
sequentially. Experiments show that our method achieves superior parameter
efficiency and computational efficiency while still maintaining leading
performance under these constraints.

### [16] [MONKEY: Masking ON KEY-Value Activation Adapter for Personalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07656)
*James Baker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve personalization in diffusion models by using automatically generated masks from IP-Adapter to restrict image tokens to the subject, allowing text prompts to better control the background.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current personalization methods often recreate the subject image while ignoring the text prompt, limiting control over generated content.

Method: Uses IP-Adapter's automatically generated masks in a second pass to mask image tokens, restricting them to the subject area so text prompts can attend to the background.

Result: Produces images that accurately depict the subject while definitively matching text prompts, especially for location/place descriptions. Shows high prompt and source image alignment compared to other methods.

Conclusion: The proposed masking approach effectively improves personalization by better integrating subject preservation with text prompt control.

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models allows users to generate new images that
incorporate a given subject, allowing more control than a text prompt. These
models often suffer somewhat when they end up just recreating the subject
image, and ignoring the text prompt. We observe that one popular method for
personalization, the IP-Adapter automatically generates masks that we
definitively segment the subject from the background during inference. We
propose to use this automatically generated mask on a second pass to mask the
image tokens, thus restricting them to the subject, not the background,
allowing the text prompt to attend to the rest of the image. For text prompts
describing locations and places, this produces images that accurately depict
the subject while definitively matching the prompt. We compare our method to a
few other test time personalization methods, and find our method displays high
prompt and source image alignment.

*Heming Wu,Di Wang,Tai Ma,Peng Zhao,Yubin Xiao,Zhongke Wu,Xing-Ce Wang,Chuang Li,Xuan Wu,You Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TCIP is a deformable medical image registration model that addresses anatomical misalignment accumulation and adaptive iteration control through Feature-Enhanced Residual Module (FERM) and dual-stage Threshold-Controlled Iterative (TCI) strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pyramid networks in medical image registration suffer from propagating anatomical misalignments and lack adaptive iteration control, leading to either premature termination or excessive iterations that degrade registration accuracy.

Method: Proposes FERM (Feature-Enhanced Residual Module) with three sequential blocks for anatomical feature extraction, irrelevant feature suppression, and deformation field estimation. Also introduces TCI (Threshold-Controlled Iterative) strategy with two stages: registration stability assessment and convergence evaluation.

Result: TCIP outperforms state-of-the-art registration networks in accuracy while maintaining comparable inference speed and compact parameter size across three brain MRI datasets and one abdomen CT dataset. FERM and TCI also show good generalizability when integrated with existing networks.

Conclusion: The proposed TCIP model effectively addresses anatomical misalignment accumulation and adaptive iteration control in medical image registration, achieving superior performance with validated effectiveness through extensive experiments and ablation studies.

Abstract: Although pyramid networks have demonstrated superior performance in
deformable medical image registration, their decoder architectures are
inherently prone to propagating and accumulating anatomical structure
misalignments. Moreover, most existing models do not adaptively determine the
number of iterations for optimization under varying deformation requirements
across images, resulting in either premature termination or excessive
iterations that degrades registration accuracy. To effectively mitigate the
accumulation of anatomical misalignments, we propose the Feature-Enhanced
Residual Module (FERM) as the core component of each decoding layer in the
pyramid network. FERM comprises three sequential blocks that extract anatomical
semantic features, learn to suppress irrelevant features, and estimate the
final deformation field, respectively. To adaptively determine the number of
iterations for varying images, we propose the dual-stage Threshold-Controlled
Iterative (TCI) strategy. In the first stage, TCI assesses registration
stability and with asserted stability, it continues with the second stage to
evaluate convergence. We coin the model that integrates FERM and TCI as
Threshold-Controlled Iterative Pyramid (TCIP). Extensive experiments on three
public brain MRI datasets and one abdomen CT dataset demonstrate that TCIP
outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) registration networks in terms of
accuracy, while maintaining comparable inference speed and a compact model
parameter size. Finally, we assess the generalizability of FERM and TCI by
integrating them with existing registration networks and further conduct
ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of these two proposed methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A video synthesis method that combines multiple user controls (from precise 4D trajectories to coarse text prompts) using variational inference and step-wise KL divergence minimization to achieve high controllability while maintaining diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generative models are limited to fixed input formats, but real video workflows need flexible control with varying granularity - from exact object trajectories to coarse text prompts.

Method: Uses variational inference to approximate composed distribution, leveraging multiple video generation backbones. Employs step-wise KL divergence minimization over annealed distributions and context-conditioned factorization to reduce solution space modes and avoid local optima.

Result: Produces samples with improved controllability, diversity, and 3D consistency compared to prior works.

Conclusion: The method successfully addresses the need for flexible control in video synthesis while maintaining quality and diversity across different specification granularities.

Abstract: Many video workflows benefit from a mixture of user controls with varying
granularity, from exact 4D object trajectories and camera paths to coarse text
prompts, while existing video generative models are typically trained for fixed
input formats. We develop a video synthesis method that addresses this need and
generates samples with high controllability for specified elements while
maintaining diversity for under-specified ones. We cast the task as variational
inference to approximate a composed distribution, leveraging multiple video
generation backbones to account for all task constraints collectively. To
address the optimization challenge, we break down the problem into step-wise KL
divergence minimization over an annealed sequence of distributions, and further
propose a context-conditioned factorization technique that reduces modes in the
solution space to circumvent local optima. Experiments suggest that our method
produces samples with improved controllability, diversity, and 3D consistency
compared to prior works.

Abstract: Induction motors (IMs) are indispensable in industrial and daily life, but
they are susceptible to various faults that can lead to overheating, wasted
energy consumption, and service failure. Early detection of faults is essential
to protect the motor and prolong its lifespan. This paper presents a hybrid
method that integrates BYOL with CNNs for classifying thermal images of
induction motors for fault detection. The thermal dataset used in this work
includes different operating states of the motor, such as normal operation,
overload, and faults. We employed multiple deep learning (DL) models for the
BYOL technique, ranging from popular architectures such as ResNet-50,
DenseNet-121, DenseNet-169, EfficientNetB0, VGG16, and MobileNetV2.
Additionally, we introduced a new high-performance yet lightweight CNN model
named BYOL-IMNet, which comprises four custom-designed blocks tailored for
fault classification in thermal images. Our experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed BYOL-IMNet achieves 99.89\% test accuracy and an inference
time of 5.7 ms per image, outperforming state-of-the-art models. This study
highlights the promising performance of the CNN-BYOL hybrid method in enhancing
accuracy for detecting faults in induction motors, offering a robust
methodology for online monitoring in industrial settings.

TL;DR: MLH is a mutual learning framework that enhances center-based hashing by transferring local similarity knowledge from a weaker pairwise-based branch, achieving superior performance through cross-branch interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Center-based hashing methods capture global data distributions well but often underutilize important local similarity information, which pairwise methods excel at preserving.

Method: Proposes Mutual Learning for Hashing (MLH) with two branches: strong center-based and weak pairwise-based. Uses iterative mutual learning and a novel mixture-of-hash-experts module for cross-branch interaction.

Result: Extensive experiments show MLH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods across multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The mutual learning framework effectively combines global structure modeling with local similarity preservation, demonstrating superior performance in large-scale image retrieval.

Abstract: Deep hashing has been widely adopted for large-scale image retrieval, with
numerous strategies proposed to optimize hash function learning. Pairwise-based
methods are effective in learning hash functions that preserve local similarity
relationships, whereas center-based methods typically achieve superior
performance by more effectively capturing global data distributions. However,
the strength of center-based methods in modeling global structures often comes
at the expense of underutilizing important local similarity information. To
address this limitation, we propose Mutual Learning for Hashing (MLH), a novel
weak-to-strong framework that enhances a center-based hashing branch by
transferring knowledge from a weaker pairwise-based branch. MLH consists of two
branches: a strong center-based branch and a weaker pairwise-based branch.
Through an iterative mutual learning process, the center-based branch leverages
local similarity cues learned by the pairwise-based branch. Furthermore,
inspired by the mixture-of-experts paradigm, we introduce a novel
mixture-of-hash-experts module that enables effective cross-branch interaction,
further enhancing the performance of both branches. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MLH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods
across multiple benchmark datasets.

Method: Proposes Repainter framework integrating spatial-matting trajectory refinement with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that modulates attention mechanisms to emphasize background context, uses composite reward mechanism balancing global, local, and semantic constraints, and introduces EcomPaint-100K dataset with EcomPaint-Bench benchmark.

Result: Extensive experiments show Repainter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in challenging scenes with intricate compositions, effectively reducing visual artifacts and reward hacking while generating higher-reward samples.

Conclusion: Repainter provides an effective solution for e-commerce image inpainting that addresses domain-specific challenges and outperforms existing methods, with code and weights to be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: In web data, product images are central to boosting user engagement and
advertising efficacy on e-commerce platforms, yet the intrusive elements such
as watermarks and promotional text remain major obstacles to delivering clear
and appealing product visuals. Although diffusion-based inpainting methods have
advanced, they still face challenges in commercial settings due to unreliable
object removal and limited domain-specific adaptation. To tackle these
challenges, we propose Repainter, a reinforcement learning framework that
integrates spatial-matting trajectory refinement with Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). Our approach modulates attention mechanisms to emphasize
background context, generating higher-reward samples and reducing unwanted
object insertion. We also introduce a composite reward mechanism that balances
global, local, and semantic constraints, effectively reducing visual artifacts
and reward hacking. Additionally, we contribute EcomPaint-100K, a high-quality,
large-scale e-commerce inpainting dataset, and a standardized benchmark
EcomPaint-Bench for fair evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Repainter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in
challenging scenes with intricate compositions. We will release our code and
weights upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods using SMPL estimation and SMPL-conditioned models suffer from inaccurate 3D priors and struggle with challenging poses and fine details in photorealistic 3D human reconstruction from single images.

Method: Jointly fine-tune multiview generative model (captures fine 2D details) and 3D native generative model (provides structural consistency) using pixel-aligned 2D-3D synchronization attention, with feature injection to lift fine details from 2D images onto 3D shapes.

Result: Achieves robust and photo-realistic 3D human reconstruction even for challenging poses, outperforming baseline methods in both geometric accuracy and visual fidelity.

Conclusion: The integration of 2D multiview and 3D native generative models demonstrates a promising direction for future 3D generation, enabling high-quality clothed human mesh reconstruction from single-view images.

Abstract: Photorealistic 3D full-body human reconstruction from a single image is a
critical yet challenging task for applications in films and video games due to
inherent ambiguities and severe self-occlusions. While recent approaches
leverage SMPL estimation and SMPL-conditioned image generative models to
hallucinate novel views, they suffer from inaccurate 3D priors estimated from
SMPL meshes and have difficulty in handling difficult human poses and
reconstructing fine details. In this paper, we propose SyncHuman, a novel
framework that combines 2D multiview generative model and 3D native generative
model for the first time, enabling high-quality clothed human mesh
reconstruction from single-view images even under challenging human poses.
Multiview generative model excels at capturing fine 2D details but struggles
with structural consistency, whereas 3D native generative model generates
coarse yet structurally consistent 3D shapes. By integrating the complementary
strengths of these two approaches, we develop a more effective generation
framework. Specifically, we first jointly fine-tune the multiview generative
model and the 3D native generative model with proposed pixel-aligned 2D-3D
synchronization attention to produce geometrically aligned 3D shapes and 2D
multiview images. To further improve details, we introduce a feature injection
mechanism that lifts fine details from 2D multiview images onto the aligned 3D
shapes, enabling accurate and high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SyncHuman achieves robust and photo-realistic 3D
human reconstruction, even for images with challenging poses. Our method
outperforms baseline methods in geometric accuracy and visual fidelity,
demonstrating a promising direction for future 3D generation models.

TL;DR: ComGS introduces a novel 3D object-scene composition framework using Surface Octahedral Probes for efficient relightable object reconstruction and simplified lighting estimation, achieving real-time rendering at 28 FPS with harmonious shadows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gaussian Splatting enables immersive rendering but struggles with realistic 3D object-scene composition due to baked appearance and shadow inconsistencies. Existing methods are inefficient or fail in complex scenes.

Method: Uses Surface Octahedral Probes (SOPs) for efficient lighting/occlusion storage and querying instead of ray tracing. For lighting estimation, captures 360° radiance field at object placement and fine-tunes diffusion model for lighting completion.

Result: Achieves 2x speedup in reconstruction, real-time shadow computation, 28 FPS rendering, visually harmonious results with vivid shadows, and only 36 seconds for editing.

Conclusion: ComGS provides an efficient framework for high-quality 3D object-scene composition with real-time performance and realistic lighting/shadow effects, overcoming limitations of existing Gaussian-based methods.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) enables immersive rendering, but realistic 3D
object-scene composition remains challenging. Baked appearance and shadow
information in GS radiance fields cause inconsistencies when combining objects
and scenes. Addressing this requires relightable object reconstruction and
scene lighting estimation. For relightable object reconstruction, existing
Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods often rely on ray tracing, leading to
low efficiency. We introduce Surface Octahedral Probes (SOPs), which store
lighting and occlusion information and allow efficient 3D querying via
interpolation, avoiding expensive ray tracing. SOPs provide at least a 2x
speedup in reconstruction and enable real-time shadow computation in Gaussian
scenes. For lighting estimation, existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering
methods struggle to model intricate light transport and often fail in complex
scenes, while learning-based methods predict lighting from a single image and
are viewpoint-sensitive. We observe that 3D object-scene composition primarily
concerns the object's appearance and nearby shadows. Thus, we simplify the
challenging task of full scene lighting estimation by focusing on the
environment lighting at the object's placement. Specifically, we capture a 360
degrees reconstructed radiance field of the scene at the location and fine-tune
a diffusion model to complete the lighting. Building on these advances, we
propose ComGS, a novel 3D object-scene composition framework. Our method
achieves high-quality, real-time rendering at around 28 FPS, produces visually
harmonious results with vivid shadows, and requires only 36 seconds for
editing. Code and dataset are available at

*Yuang Meng,Xin Jin,Lina Lei,Chun-Le Guo,Chongyi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UltraLED is a two-stage framework that uses a single short-exposure RAW image to reconstruct Ultra-High Dynamic Range (UHDR) scenes, avoiding ghosting artifacts while recovering details in dark regions through exposure correction and brightness-aware denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UHDR scenes with significant exposure disparities between bright and dark regions are challenging to capture. RGB bracketing methods suffer from misalignment and ghosting, while single short-exposure RAW images offer higher bit depth and predictable noise characteristics for better detail recovery.

Method: A two-stage framework: 1) exposure correction via ratio map to balance dynamic range, 2) brightness-aware RAW denoiser to enhance detail recovery in dark regions. Uses only single short-exposure RAW input and created a 9-stop bracketing pipeline for dataset synthesis.

Result: UltraLED significantly outperforms existing single-frame approaches in UHDR reconstruction, demonstrating robust performance in dynamic scenes without ghosting or motion blur artifacts.

Conclusion: Single short-exposure RAW images are sufficient for high-quality UHDR reconstruction when processed through the proposed UltraLED framework, which effectively addresses the challenges of noise reduction and detail recovery in dark regions while avoiding alignment issues.

Abstract: Ultra-high dynamic range (UHDR) scenes exhibit significant exposure
disparities between bright and dark regions. Such conditions are commonly
encountered in nighttime scenes with light sources. Even with standard exposure
settings, a bimodal intensity distribution with boundary peaks often emerges,
making it difficult to preserve both highlight and shadow details
simultaneously. RGB-based bracketing methods can capture details at both ends
using short-long exposure pairs, but are susceptible to misalignment and
ghosting artifacts. We found that a short-exposure image already retains
sufficient highlight detail. The main challenge of UHDR reconstruction lies in
denoising and recovering information in dark regions. In comparison to the RGB
images, RAW images, thanks to their higher bit depth and more predictable noise
characteristics, offer greater potential for addressing this challenge. This
raises a key question: can we learn to see everything in UHDR scenes using only
a single short-exposure RAW image? In this study, we rely solely on a single
short-exposure frame, which inherently avoids ghosting and motion blur, making
it particularly robust in dynamic scenes. To achieve that, we introduce
UltraLED, a two-stage framework that performs exposure correction via a ratio
map to balance dynamic range, followed by a brightness-aware RAW denoiser to
enhance detail recovery in dark regions. To support this setting, we design a
9-stop bracketing pipeline to synthesize realistic UHDR images and contribute a
corresponding dataset based on diverse scenes, using only the shortest exposure
as input for reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that UltraLED
significantly outperforms existing single-frame approaches. Our code and
dataset are made publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework that combines low-framerate RGB videos with high-framerate event streams to reconstruct Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting, using event motion priors to guide deformation field optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstructing Dynamic 3DGS from low-framerate RGB videos is challenging due to large inter-frame motions increasing solution uncertainty. Event cameras capture rapid visual changes robustly but lack color information, so combining both modalities can address this challenge.

Method: Uses event motion priors to guide deformation field optimization. First extracts motion priors from event streams using LoCM unsupervised fine-tuning framework, then employs geometry-aware data association to build event-Gaussian motion correspondence with motion decomposition and inter-frame pseudo-label strategies.

Result: Outperforms existing image and event-based approaches across synthetic and real scenes, effectively optimizing dynamic 3DGS with event data assistance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully leverages event data to overcome challenges in dynamic 3DGS reconstruction from low-framerate RGB videos, demonstrating superior performance through joint optimization of both modalities.

Abstract: Reconstructing Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from low-framerate RGB
videos is challenging. This is because large inter-frame motions will increase
the uncertainty of the solution space. For example, one pixel in the first
frame might have more choices to reach the corresponding pixel in the second
frame. Event cameras can asynchronously capture rapid visual changes and are
robust to motion blur, but they do not provide color information. Intuitively,
the event stream can provide deterministic constraints for the inter-frame
large motion by the event trajectories. Hence, combining
low-temporal-resolution images with high-framerate event streams can address
this challenge. However, it is challenging to jointly optimize Dynamic 3DGS
using both RGB and event modalities due to the significant discrepancy between
these two data modalities. This paper introduces a novel framework that jointly
optimizes dynamic 3DGS from the two modalities. The key idea is to adopt event
motion priors to guide the optimization of the deformation fields. First, we
extract the motion priors encoded in event streams by using the proposed LoCM
unsupervised fine-tuning framework to adapt an event flow estimator to a
certain unseen scene. Then, we present the geometry-aware data association
method to build the event-Gaussian motion correspondence, which is the primary
foundation of the pipeline, accompanied by two useful strategies, namely motion
decomposition and inter-frame pseudo-label. Extensive experiments show that our
method outperforms existing image and event-based approaches across synthetic
and real scenes and prove that our method can effectively optimize dynamic 3DGS
with the help of event data.

Conclusion: ResUNet is recommended as the best-performing model for automated brain tumor segmentation in future clinical assessments, with XAI successfully enhancing model interpretability.

Abstract: The current study investigated the use of Explainable Artificial Intelligence

employed with the aims of clarifying model decisions and increasing physicians'
trust in these models. We compared the performance of two UNet variants
(ResUNet and AttUNet) with the conventional UNet in segmenting brain tumors
from the BraTS2020 public dataset and analyzed model predictions with Grad-CAM
and attention-based visualization. Using the latest computer hardware, we
trained and validated each model using the Adam optimizer and assessed their
performance with respect to: (i) training, validation, and inference times,
(ii) segmentation similarity coefficients and loss functions, and (iii)
classification performance. Notably, during the final testing phase, ResUNet
outperformed the other models with respect to Dice and Jaccard similarity
scores, as well as accuracy, recall, and F1 scores. Grad-CAM provided
visuospatial insights into the tumor subregions each UNet model focused on
while attention-based visualization provided valuable insights into the working
mechanisms of AttUNet's attention modules. These results demonstrated ResUNet
as the best-performing model and we conclude by recommending its use for
automated brain tumor segmentation in future clinical assessments. Our source

### [28] [GTR-Bench: Evaluating Geo-Temporal Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07791)
*Qinghongbing Xie,Zhaoyuan Xia,Feng Zhu,Lijun Gong,Ziyue Li,Rui Zhao,Long Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GTR-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating Visual-Language Models' geographic temporal reasoning capabilities, requiring reasoning across multiple camera videos and maps. Current VLMs perform poorly (34.9% vs human 78.61%) due to imbalanced context utilization, weak temporal forecasting, and poor map-video alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spatial-temporal benchmarks focus on either egocentric perspective reasoning with images/video or geographic perspective reasoning with maps, but fail to assess VLMs' geographic spatial-temporal intelligence with both images/video and graphics context, which is important for applications like traffic management and emergency response.

Method: Introduced Geo-Temporal Reasoning benchmark (GTR-Bench) that requires: multiple perspective switches between maps and videos, joint reasoning across multiple videos with non-overlapping fields of view, and inference over spatial-temporal regions unobserved by any video context.

Result: Evaluation of over 10 popular VLMs shows the best proprietary model (Gemini-2.5-Pro) achieves only 34.9% accuracy, significantly lagging behind human performance (78.61%). Three primary deficiencies identified: imbalanced utilization of spatial-temporal context, weak temporal forecasting, and poor map-video comprehension/alignment.

Conclusion: GTR-Bench reveals significant gaps in current VLMs' geo-temporal reasoning capabilities and provides valuable insights for future research in spatial-temporal intelligence, with potential applications in autonomous driving, embodied AI, and general artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Recently spatial-temporal intelligence of Visual-Language Models (VLMs) has
attracted much attention due to its importance for Autonomous Driving, Embodied
AI and General Artificial Intelligence. Existing spatial-temporal benchmarks
mainly focus on egocentric perspective reasoning with images/video context, or
geographic perspective reasoning with graphics context (eg. a map), thus fail
to assess VLMs' geographic spatial-temporal intelligence with both images/video
and graphics context, which is important for areas like traffic management and
emergency response. To address the gaps, we introduce Geo-Temporal Reasoning
benchmark (GTR-Bench), a novel challenge for geographic temporal reasoning of
moving targets in a large-scale camera network. GTR-Bench is more challenging
as it requires multiple perspective switches between maps and videos, joint
reasoning across multiple videos with non-overlapping fields of view, and
inference over spatial-temporal regions that are unobserved by any video
context. Evaluations of more than 10 popular VLMs on GTR-Bench demonstrate that
even the best proprietary model, Gemini-2.5-Pro (34.9%), significantly lags
behind human performance (78.61%) on geo-temporal reasoning. Moreover, our
comprehensive analysis on GTR-Bench reveals three primary deficiencies of
current models for geo-temporal reasoning. (1) VLMs' reasoning is impaired by
an imbalanced utilization of spatial-temporal context. (2) VLMs are weak in
temporal forecasting, which leads to worse performance on temporal-emphasized
tasks than on spatial-emphasized tasks. (3) VLMs lack the proficiency to
comprehend or align the map data with multi-view video inputs. We believe
GTR-Bench offers valuable insights and opens up new opportunities for research
and applications in spatial-temporal intelligence. Benchmark and code will be
released at https://github.com/X-Luffy/GTR-Bench.

### [29] [FMANet: A Novel Dual-Phase Optical Flow Approach with Fusion Motion Attention Network for Robust Micro-expression Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07810)
*Luu Tu Nguyen,Vu Tram Anh Khuong,Thi Bich Phuong Man,Thi Duyen Ngo,Thanh Ha Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MM-COF, a comprehensive motion representation that integrates optical flow from both onset-apex and apex-offset phases of micro-expressions, and FMANet, an end-to-end neural network that adaptively fuses these dual-phase motion cues for improved micro-expression recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current micro-expression recognition methods only use optical flow between onset and apex frames, ignoring important motion information in the apex-to-offset phase, which limits recognition performance.

Method: Introduces MM-COF motion representation that combines optical flow from both micro-expression phases, and FMANet neural network with learnable modules for adaptive fusion of dual-phase motion cues and attention to salient facial regions.

Result: Experimental evaluations on MMEW, SMIC, CASME-II, and SAMM datasets show that both MM-COF representation and FMANet outperform existing methods.

Conclusion: The learnable dual-phase framework demonstrates significant potential for advancing micro-expression recognition by capturing comprehensive motion dynamics.

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions, characterized by their subtle and brief nature, are
valuable indicators of genuine emotions. Despite their significance in
psychology, security, and behavioral analysis, micro-expression recognition
remains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing subtle facial movements.
Optical flow has been widely employed as an input modality for this task due to
its effectiveness. However, most existing methods compute optical flow only
between the onset and apex frames, thereby overlooking essential motion
information in the apex-to-offset phase. To address this limitation, we first
introduce a comprehensive motion representation, termed Magnitude-Modulated
Combined Optical Flow (MM-COF), which integrates motion dynamics from both
micro-expression phases into a unified descriptor suitable for direct use in
recognition networks. Building upon this principle, we then propose FMANet, a
novel end-to-end neural network architecture that internalizes the dual-phase
analysis and magnitude modulation into learnable modules. This allows the
network to adaptively fuse motion cues and focus on salient facial regions for
classification. Experimental evaluations on the MMEW, SMIC, CASME-II, and SAMM
datasets, widely recognized as standard benchmarks, demonstrate that our
proposed MM-COF representation and FMANet outperforms existing methods,
underscoring the potential of a learnable, dual-phase framework in advancing
micro-expression recognition.

*Kanglin Ning,Ruzhao Chen,Penghong Wang,Xingtao Wang,Ruiqin Xiong,Xiaopeng Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A depth estimation framework for 360° indoor panoramas using room geometry constraints to improve depth prediction accuracy and avoid oversmoothing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on pixel-level accuracy but cause oversmoothed room corners and noise sensitivity in spherical pixel depth prediction from monocular 360° indoor panoramas.

Method: Proposes a framework with shared feature encoder and task-specific decoders for layout estimation, depth estimation, and background segmentation. Uses room geometry-based background depth resolving strategy and background-segmentation-guided fusion mechanism.

Result: Achieves significantly superior performance compared to current open-source methods on Stanford2D3D, Matterport3D and Structured3D datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed room geometry constraint-based framework effectively improves depth estimation for 360° indoor panoramas by leveraging layout prediction and background segmentation.

Abstract: Predicting spherical pixel depth from monocular $360^{\circ}$ indoor
panoramas is critical for many vision applications. However, existing methods
focus on pixel-level accuracy, causing oversmoothed room corners and noise
sensitivity. In this paper, we propose a depth estimation framework based on
room geometry constraints, which extracts room geometry information through
layout prediction and integrates those information into the depth estimation
process through background segmentation mechanism. At the model level, our
framework comprises a shared feature encoder followed by task-specific decoders
for layout estimation, depth estimation, and background segmentation. The
shared encoder extracts multi-scale features, which are subsequently processed
by individual decoders to generate initial predictions: a depth map, a room
layout map, and a background segmentation map. Furthermore, our framework
incorporates two strategies: a room geometry-based background depth resolving
strategy and a background-segmentation-guided fusion mechanism. The proposed
room-geometry-based background depth resolving strategy leverages the room
layout and the depth decoder's output to generate the corresponding background
depth map. Then, a background-segmentation-guided fusion strategy derives
fusion weights for the background and coarse depth maps from the segmentation
decoder's predictions. Extensive experimental results on the Stanford2D3D,
Matterport3D and Structured3D datasets show that our proposed methods can
achieve significantly superior performance than current open-source methods.

### [31] [Enhancing Visual Prompting through Expanded Transformation Space and Overfitting Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07823)
*Shohei Enomoto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ACAVP enhances visual prompting with affine and color transformations to address expressivity limitations and overfitting, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional visual prompting methods suffer from limited expressivity due to simple additive transformations and overfitting when increasing parameters, leading to lower accuracy compared to other adaptation approaches.

Method: Proposed ACAVP with affine transformation for creating task-specific prompt regions while preserving original information, color transformation for emphasizing relevant features, and TrivialAugment for data augmentation to combat overfitting.

Result: ACAVP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among VP methods, surpasses linear probing in average accuracy, and shows superior robustness to distribution shifts across twelve datasets with two model architectures.

Conclusion: ACAVP effectively addresses VP limitations through complementary transformations and data augmentation, demonstrating that appropriate augmentation is universally beneficial for VP training while maintaining minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Visual prompting (VP) has emerged as a promising parameter-efficient
fine-tuning approach for adapting pre-trained vision models to downstream tasks
without modifying model parameters. Despite offering advantages like negligible
computational overhead and compatibility with black-box models, conventional VP
methods typically achieve lower accuracy than other adaptation approaches. Our
analysis reveals two critical limitations: the restricted expressivity of
simple additive transformation and a tendency toward overfitting when the
parameter count increases. To address these challenges, we propose ACAVP
(Affine, Color, and Additive Visual Prompting), which enhances VP's expressive
power by introducing complementary transformation operations: affine
transformation for creating task-specific prompt regions while preserving
original image information, and color transformation for emphasizing
task-relevant visual features. Additionally, we identify that overfitting is a
critical issue in VP training and introduce TrivialAugment as an effective data
augmentation, which not only benefits our approach but also significantly
improves existing VP methods, with performance gains of up to 12 percentage
points on certain datasets. This demonstrates that appropriate data
augmentation is universally beneficial for VP training. Extensive experiments
across twelve diverse image classification datasets with two different model
architectures demonstrate that ACAVP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among
VP methods, surpasses linear probing in average accuracy, and exhibits superior
robustness to distribution shifts, all while maintaining minimal computational
overhead during inference.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMHOI is a large-scale dataset for multi-human multi-object interactions with complete 3D annotations, and MMHOI-Net is a transformer-based model that achieves state-of-the-art performance in modeling these complex interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D human-object interaction benchmarks only cover simple interactions, while real-world scenes involve multiple humans interacting with multiple objects in complex, goal-oriented ways.

Method: MMHOI-Net uses an end-to-end transformer-based neural network with structured dual-patch representation for objects and their interactions, combined with action recognition to enhance interaction prediction.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on MMHOI and CORE4D datasets, excelling in both accuracy and reconstruction quality for multi-human multi-object interaction modeling.

Conclusion: MMHOI dataset and MMHOI-Net framework successfully address the gap in complex multi-human multi-object interaction modeling, providing a comprehensive testbed for next-generation HOI research.

Abstract: Real-world scenes often feature multiple humans interacting with multiple
objects in ways that are causal, goal-oriented, or cooperative. Yet existing 3D
human-object interaction (HOI) benchmarks consider only a fraction of these
complex interactions. To close this gap, we present MMHOI -- a large-scale,
Multi-human Multi-object Interaction dataset consisting of images from 12
everyday scenarios. MMHOI offers complete 3D shape and pose annotations for
every person and object, along with labels for 78 action categories and 14
interaction-specific body parts, providing a comprehensive testbed for
next-generation HOI research. Building on MMHOI, we present MMHOI-Net, an
end-to-end transformer-based neural network for jointly estimating human-object
3D geometries, their interactions, and associated actions. A key innovation in
our framework is a structured dual-patch representation for modeling objects
and their interactions, combined with action recognition to enhance the
interaction prediction. Experiments on MMHOI and the recently proposed CORE4D
datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in
multi-HOI modeling, excelling in both accuracy and reconstruction quality.

*Houqiang Zhong,Zhenglong Wu,Sihua Fu,Zihan Zheng,Xin Jin,Xiaoyun Zhang,Li Song,Qiang Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PrismGS is a regularization framework that improves 3D Gaussian Splatting for large urban environments by adding pyramidal multi-scale supervision and explicit size regularization to reduce aliasing artifacts and optimization instability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting suffers from severe aliasing artifacts and optimization instability when scaling to large urban environments, especially under high-resolution rendering, due to mismatch between Gaussian primitives and multi-scale urban geometry.

Method: Integrates two regularizers: pyramidal multi-scale supervision that enforces consistency against pre-filtered image pyramids, and explicit size regularization that imposes physically-grounded lower bounds on 3D Gaussian dimensions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant PSNR gains around 1.5 dB against CityGaussian, maintaining superior quality and robustness under 4K rendering on MatrixCity, Mill-19, and UrbanScene3D datasets.

Conclusion: PrismGS provides a plug-and-play framework that improves intrinsic rendering behavior of 3D Gaussians, effectively mitigating flickering textures and jagged edges in large-scale urban environments while maintaining compatibility with existing pipelines.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently enabled real-time photorealistic
rendering in compact scenes, but scaling to large urban environments introduces
severe aliasing artifacts and optimization instability, especially under
high-resolution (e.g., 4K) rendering. These artifacts, manifesting as
flickering textures and jagged edges, arise from the mismatch between Gaussian
primitives and the multi-scale nature of urban geometry. While existing
``divide-and-conquer'' pipelines address scalability, they fail to resolve this
fidelity gap. In this paper, we propose PrismGS, a physically-grounded
regularization framework that improves the intrinsic rendering behavior of 3D
Gaussians. PrismGS integrates two synergistic regularizers. The first is
pyramidal multi-scale supervision, which enforces consistency by supervising
the rendering against a pre-filtered image pyramid. This compels the model to
learn an inherently anti-aliased representation that remains coherent across
different viewing scales, directly mitigating flickering textures. This is
complemented by an explicit size regularization that imposes a
physically-grounded lower bound on the dimensions of the 3D Gaussians. This
prevents the formation of degenerate, view-dependent primitives, leading to
more stable and plausible geometric surfaces and reducing jagged edges. Our
method is plug-and-play and compatible with existing pipelines. Extensive
experiments on MatrixCity, Mill-19, and UrbanScene3D demonstrate that PrismGS
achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding significant PSNR gains around
1.5 dB against CityGaussian, while maintaining its superior quality and
robustness under demanding 4K rendering.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IsoSignVid2Aud is an end-to-end framework that translates isolated sign language video sequences directly to speech without intermediate text representation, using I3D-based feature extraction and a novel NMS algorithm for temporal sign detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge communication between hearing/speech-challenged individuals and others by providing immediate translation of sign language videos to speech, avoiding latency and cascading errors of multi-stage systems.

Method: Combines I3D-based feature extraction with specialized feature transformation and audio generation pipeline, using a novel Non-Maximal Suppression algorithm for temporal detection of signs in non-grammatic continuous sequences.

Result: Achieved Top-1 accuracies of 72.01% on ASL-Citizen-1500 and 78.67% on WLASL-100 datasets, with audio quality metrics (PESQ: 2.67, STOI: 0.73) indicating intelligible speech output.

Conclusion: The proposed end-to-end framework successfully translates sign language videos to speech with competitive performance and immediate communication benefits, eliminating the need for intermediate text representation.

Abstract: Sign language to spoken language audio translation is important to connect
the hearing- and speech-challenged humans with others. We consider sign
language videos with isolated sign sequences rather than continuous grammatical
signing. Such videos are useful in educational applications and sign prompt
interfaces. Towards this, we propose IsoSignVid2Aud, a novel end-to-end
framework that translates sign language videos with a sequence of possibly
non-grammatic continuous signs to speech without requiring intermediate text
representation, providing immediate communication benefits while avoiding the
latency and cascading errors inherent in multi-stage translation systems. Our
approach combines an I3D-based feature extraction module with a specialized
feature transformation network and an audio generation pipeline, utilizing a
novel Non-Maximal Suppression (NMS) algorithm for the temporal detection of
signs in non-grammatic continuous sequences. Experimental results demonstrate
competitive performance on ASL-Citizen-1500 and WLASL-100 datasets with Top-1
accuracies of 72.01\% and 78.67\%, respectively, and audio quality metrics

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AlignGS introduces a framework that uses semantic understanding as an active guide for sparse-view 3D reconstruction, achieving state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis and geometric accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating semantically rich 3D models from sparse views is challenging due to geometric ambiguity. Existing methods treat semantics as passive features rather than active guides for geometry formation.

Method: AlignGS performs end-to-end optimization of geometry and semantics, distilling priors from 2D foundation models and using novel semantic-to-geometry guidance mechanisms including depth consistency and multi-faceted normal regularization.

Result: Extensive evaluations show state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis and superior geometric accuracy on standard benchmarks, producing more coherent and complete 3D models from limited views.

Conclusion: Using semantic priors as geometric regularizers leads to more robust sparse-view reconstruction, validating that semantic understanding should be an active guiding force rather than a passive feature.

Abstract: The demand for semantically rich 3D models of indoor scenes is rapidly
growing, driven by applications in augmented reality, virtual reality, and
robotics. However, creating them from sparse views remains a challenge due to
geometric ambiguity. Existing methods often treat semantics as a passive
feature painted on an already-formed, and potentially flawed, geometry. We
posit that for robust sparse-view reconstruction, semantic understanding
instead be an active, guiding force. This paper introduces AlignGS, a novel
framework that actualizes this vision by pioneering a synergistic, end-to-end
optimization of geometry and semantics. Our method distills rich priors from 2D
foundation models and uses them to directly regularize the 3D representation
through a set of novel semantic-to-geometry guidance mechanisms, including
depth consistency and multi-faceted normal regularization. Extensive
evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis and produces reconstructions
with superior geometric accuracy. The results validate that leveraging semantic
priors as a geometric regularizer leads to more coherent and complete 3D models
from limited input views. Our code is avaliable at

Motivation: High-throughput toxicity testing requires automated evaluation via machine learning models to efficiently test large amounts of compounds.

Method: Used self-supervised learning to learn representations from the EmbryoNet dataset containing zebrafish embryo phenotypes elicited by various chemical compounds.

Result: Learned representations effectively distinguish between modes-of-action of different compounds and identify toxicant-induced changes.

Conclusion: Self-supervised learning is suitable for toxicity testing applications, with potential integration into physical testing devices like the TOXBOX project.

Abstract: High-throughput toxicity testing offers a fast and cost-effective way to test
large amounts of compounds. A key component for such systems is the automated
evaluation via machine learning models. In this paper, we address critical
challenges in this domain and demonstrate how representations learned via
self-supervised learning can effectively identify toxicant-induced changes. We
provide a proof-of-concept that utilizes the publicly available EmbryoNet
dataset, which contains ten zebrafish embryo phenotypes elicited by various
chemical compounds targeting different processes in early embryonic
development. Our analysis shows that the learned representations using
self-supervised learning are suitable for effectively distinguishing between
the modes-of-action of different compounds. Finally, we discuss the integration
of machine learning models in a physical toxicity testing device in the context
of the TOXBOX project.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XYZCylinder is a feedforward model for 3D scene reconstruction in driving scenarios that uses a unified cylinder lifting method to handle varying camera configurations and improve reconstruction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feedforward reconstruction methods struggle with generalization across different camera configurations and have limited accuracy due to sparse views and complex driving scenes.

Method: Proposes Unified Cylinder Camera Modeling (UCCM) to handle different camera configurations with adjustable parameters, and uses Cylinder Plane Feature Group (CPFG) with hybrid representation to lift 2D image features to 3D space.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance under different evaluation settings and demonstrates zero-shot generalization to other driving scenes.

Conclusion: XYZCylinder effectively addresses generalization and accuracy limitations in driving scene reconstruction through unified camera modeling and hybrid feature representation.

Abstract: Recently, more attention has been paid to feedforward reconstruction
paradigms, which mainly learn a fixed view transformation implicitly and
reconstruct the scene with a single representation. However, their
generalization capability and reconstruction accuracy are still limited while
reconstructing driving scenes, which results from two aspects: (1) The fixed
view transformation fails when the camera configuration changes, limiting the
generalization capability across different driving scenes equipped with
different camera configurations. (2) The small overlapping regions between
sparse views of the $360^\circ$ panorama and the complexity of driving scenes
increase the learning difficulty, reducing the reconstruction accuracy. To
handle these difficulties, we propose \textbf{XYZCylinder}, a feedforward model
based on a unified cylinder lifting method which involves camera modeling and
feature lifting. Specifically, to improve the generalization capability, we
design a Unified Cylinder Camera Modeling (UCCM) strategy, which avoids the
learning of viewpoint-dependent spatial correspondence and unifies different
camera configurations with adjustable parameters. To improve the reconstruction
accuracy, we propose a hybrid representation with several dedicated modules
based on newly designed Cylinder Plane Feature Group (CPFG) to lift 2D image
features to 3D space. Experimental results show that XYZCylinder achieves
state-of-the-art performance under different evaluation settings, and can be
generalized to other driving scenes in a zero-shot manner. Project page:

Motivation: Visual language models face heavy computational costs when processing videos due to high frame rates and long durations, while existing token compression methods cause information loss and performance degradation.

Method: Proposes a retrieve-then-compress strategy using Visual Memory Retriever (VMR) to select key clips and Compression Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO) to distill reasoning ability from teacher to student model.

Conclusion: MARC demonstrates potential for efficient, real-time video understanding in resource-constrained settings like video QA, surveillance, and autonomous driving.

Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has laid the foundation
for multimodal models. However, visual language models (VLMs) still face heavy
computational costs when extended from images to videos due to high frame rates
and long durations. Token compression is a promising solution, yet most
existing training-free methods cause information loss and performance
degradation. To overcome this, we propose \textbf{Memory-Augmented
Reinforcement Learning-based Token Compression (MARC)}, which integrates
structured retrieval and RL-based distillation. MARC adopts a
\textit{retrieve-then-compress} strategy using a \textbf{Visual Memory
Retriever (VMR)} to select key clips and a \textbf{Compression Group Relative
Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)} framework to distil reasoning ability from a
teacher to a student model. Experiments on six video benchmarks show that MARC
achieves near-baseline accuracy using only one frame's tokens -- reducing
visual tokens by \textbf{95\%}, GPU memory by \textbf{72\%}, and latency by
\textbf{23.9\%}. This demonstrates its potential for efficient, real-time video
understanding in resource-constrained settings such as video QA, surveillance,

Conclusion: ASBench addresses critical gaps in anomaly synthesis evaluation and offers a comprehensive framework to advance research in this field, enabling better understanding of synthesis methods' effectiveness across different scenarios.

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in manufacturing quality control, yet
its application is constrained by limited abnormal samples and high manual
annotation costs. While anomaly synthesis offers a promising solution, existing
studies predominantly treat anomaly synthesis as an auxiliary component within
anomaly detection frameworks, lacking systematic evaluation of anomaly

to anomaly synthesis, such as decoupling its impact from detection,
quantitative analysis of synthetic data and adaptability across different
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose ASBench, the first
comprehensive benchmarking framework dedicated to evaluating anomaly synthesis
methods. Our framework introduces four critical evaluation dimensions: (i) the
generalization performance across different datasets and pipelines (ii) the
ratio of synthetic to real data (iii) the correlation between intrinsic metrics
of synthesis images and anomaly detection performance metrics , and (iv)
strategies for hybrid anomaly synthesis methods. Through extensive experiments,
ASBench not only reveals limitations in current anomaly synthesis methods but
also provides actionable insights for future research directions in anomaly

*Leigang Qu,Ziyang Wang,Na Zheng,Wenjie Wang,Liqiang Nie,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TTOM is a training-free framework that improves compositional video generation by aligning video foundation models with spatiotemporal layouts during inference using optimization and memory mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video Foundation Models struggle with compositional scenarios like motion, numeracy, and spatial relations, requiring better text-image alignment.

Method: Integrates and optimizes new parameters guided by layout-attention objective, uses parametric memory mechanism for historical optimization contexts with streaming operations (insert, read, update, delete).

Result: TTOM disentangles compositional world knowledge, shows powerful transferability and generalization, and achieves effective cross-modal alignment for compositional video generation.

Conclusion: TTOM is an effective, practical, scalable, and efficient framework for compositional video generation that works on the fly without training.

Abstract: Video Foundation Models (VFMs) exhibit remarkable visual generation
performance, but struggle in compositional scenarios (e.g., motion, numeracy,
and spatial relation). In this work, we introduce Test-Time Optimization and
Memorization (TTOM), a training-free framework that aligns VFM outputs with
spatiotemporal layouts during inference for better text-image alignment. Rather
than direct intervention to latents or attention per-sample in existing work,
we integrate and optimize new parameters guided by a general layout-attention
objective. Furthermore, we formulate video generation within a streaming
setting, and maintain historical optimization contexts with a parametric memory
mechanism that supports flexible operations, such as insert, read, update, and
delete. Notably, we found that TTOM disentangles compositional world knowledge,
showing powerful transferability and generalization. Experimental results on
the T2V-CompBench and Vbench benchmarks establish TTOM as an effective,
practical, scalable, and efficient framework to achieve cross-modal alignment

Conclusion: The proposed CVD-STORM model successfully generates high-quality multi-view videos with 4D reconstruction capabilities, advancing scene understanding for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Generative models have been widely applied to world modeling for environment
simulation and future state prediction. With advancements in autonomous
driving, there is a growing demand not only for high-fidelity video generation
under various controls, but also for producing diverse and meaningful

Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that generates long-term, multi-view videos with
4D reconstruction capabilities under various control inputs. Our approach first
fine-tunes the VAE with an auxiliary 4D reconstruction task, enhancing its
ability to encode 3D structures and temporal dynamics. Subsequently, we
integrate this VAE into the video diffusion process to significantly improve
generation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves
substantial improvements in both FID and FVD metrics. Additionally, the
jointly-trained Gaussian Splatting Decoder effectively reconstructs dynamic
scenes, providing valuable geometric information for comprehensive scene
understanding.

Motivation: Current text detection datasets target natural/document scenes with regular text, but anime scenes have diverse, irregular text styles that are easily confused with visual elements, creating a significant gap in available datasets.

Method: Created AnimeText dataset with hierarchical annotations and hard negative samples specifically designed for anime scenarios, then conducted cross-dataset benchmarking using state-of-the-art text detection methods.

Result: Models trained on AnimeText outperform those trained on existing datasets in anime scene text detection tasks, demonstrating superior performance in complex anime scenes.

Conclusion: AnimeText effectively addresses the gap in anime text detection and provides a robust dataset that improves performance on anime-specific text detection tasks.

Abstract: Current text detection datasets primarily target natural or document scenes,
where text typically appear in regular font and shapes, monotonous colors, and
orderly layouts. The text usually arranged along straight or curved lines.
However, these characteristics differ significantly from anime scenes, where
text is often diverse in style, irregularly arranged, and easily confused with
complex visual elements such as symbols and decorative patterns. Text in anime
scene also includes a large number of handwritten and stylized fonts. Motivated
by this gap, we introduce AnimeText, a large-scale dataset containing 735K
images and 4.2M annotated text blocks. It features hierarchical annotations and
hard negative samples tailored for anime scenarios. %Cross-dataset evaluations
using state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that models trained on AnimeText
achieve superior performance in anime text detection tasks compared to existing
datasets. To evaluate the robustness of AnimeText in complex anime scenes, we
conducted cross-dataset benchmarking using state-of-the-art text detection

TL;DR: SimCast is a novel precipitation nowcasting pipeline using short-to-long term knowledge distillation and weighted MSE loss, integrated with CasCast diffusion framework to overcome deterministic model limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precipitation nowcasting is crucial for disaster management, agriculture, transportation, and energy optimization, but existing non-autoregressive approaches have limitations in handling complex Earth system dynamics.

Method: Proposed SimCast with short-to-long term knowledge distillation and weighted MSE loss for heavy rainfall regions, then integrated with CasCast diffusion framework for probabilistic modeling to address blurriness and distribution shift.

Result: Achieved mean CSI scores of 0.452 on SEVIR, 0.474 on HKO-7, and 0.361 on MeteoNet, significantly outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively improves precipitation nowcasting accuracy without additional inference overhead, combining deterministic and probabilistic modeling strengths.

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting predicts future radar sequences based on current
observations, which is a highly challenging task driven by the inherent
complexity of the Earth system. Accurate nowcasting is of utmost importance for
addressing various societal needs, including disaster management, agriculture,
transportation, and energy optimization. As a complementary to existing
non-autoregressive nowcasting approaches, we investigate the impact of
prediction horizons on nowcasting models and propose SimCast, a novel training
pipeline featuring a short-to-long term knowledge distillation technique
coupled with a weighted MSE loss to prioritize heavy rainfall regions. Improved
nowcasting predictions can be obtained without introducing additional overhead
during inference. As SimCast generates deterministic predictions, we further
integrate it into a diffusion-based framework named CasCast, leveraging the
strengths from probabilistic models to overcome limitations such as blurriness
and distribution shift in deterministic outputs. Extensive experimental results
on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework, achieving mean CSI scores of 0.452 on SEVIR, 0.474 on HKO-7, and
0.361 on MeteoNet, which outperforms existing approaches by a significant

TL;DR: Latent Harmony is a two-stage VAE framework for UHD image restoration that balances computational efficiency and high-frequency detail retention through joint latent space regularization and high-frequency-aware reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between computational efficiency and high-frequency detail retention in UHD image restoration, overcoming limitations of standard VAEs that discard degradation-specific high-frequency information due to Gaussian constraints.

Method: Two-stage framework: Stage One introduces LH-VAE with visual semantic constraints, progressive degradation perturbations, and latent equivariance. Stage Two jointly trains the refined VAE with restoration model using HF-LoRA - encoder LoRA with fidelity-oriented high-frequency alignment loss and decoder LoRA with perception-oriented loss, trained via alternating optimization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across UHD and standard-resolution tasks, effectively balancing efficiency, perceptual quality, and reconstruction accuracy with tunable fidelity-perception trade-offs.

Conclusion: Latent Harmony successfully redefines VAEs for UHD restoration by addressing the efficiency-detail trade-off through joint latent space regularization and high-frequency-aware reconstruction, enabling flexible fidelity-perception balance.

Abstract: Ultra-High Definition (UHD) image restoration faces a trade-off between
computational efficiency and high-frequency detail retention. While Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) improve efficiency via latent-space processing, their
Gaussian constraint often discards degradation-specific high-frequency
information, hurting reconstruction fidelity. To overcome this, we propose
Latent Harmony, a two-stage framework that redefines VAEs for UHD restoration
by jointly regularizing the latent space and enforcing high-frequency-aware
reconstruction.In Stage One, we introduce LH-VAE, which enhances semantic
robustness through visual semantic constraints and progressive degradation
perturbations, while latent equivariance strengthens high-frequency
reconstruction.Stage Two jointly trains this refined VAE with a restoration
model using High-Frequency Low-Rank Adaptation (HF-LoRA): an encoder LoRA
guided by a fidelity-oriented high-frequency alignment loss to recover
authentic details, and a decoder LoRA driven by a perception-oriented loss to
synthesize realistic textures. Both LoRA modules are trained via alternating
optimization with selective gradient propagation to preserve the pretrained
latent structure.At inference, a tunable parameter {\alpha} enables flexible
fidelity-perception trade-offs.Experiments show Latent Harmony achieves
state-of-the-art performance across UHD and standard-resolution tasks,
effectively balancing efficiency, perceptual quality, and reconstruction
accuracy.

*Darya Baranouskaya,Andrea Cavallaro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Abstract tags are more effective than object tags for image privacy classification when tag budget is limited, but object tags become equally useful when more tags are available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine which type of tags (object vs abstract) is more suitable for the context-dependent and subjective task of image privacy classification.

Method: Explored the effectiveness of object tags (denoting concrete entities) versus abstract tags (capturing higher-level contextual information) for image privacy classification under different tag budget constraints.

Result: Abstract tags are more effective for privacy classification when tag budget is limited. When more tags per image are available, object-related information becomes equally useful.

Conclusion: The findings provide guidance for developing more accurate image privacy classifiers by considering the role of tag types and quantity.

Abstract: Object tags denote concrete entities and are central to many computer vision
tasks, whereas abstract tags capture higher-level information, which is
relevant for tasks that require a contextual, potentially subjective scene
understanding. Object and abstract tags extracted from images also facilitate
interpretability. In this paper, we explore which type of tags is more suitable
for the context-dependent and inherently subjective task of image privacy.
While object tags are generally used for privacy classification, we show that
abstract tags are more effective when the tag budget is limited. Conversely,
when a larger number of tags per image is available, object-related information
is as useful. We believe that these findings will guide future research in
developing more accurate image privacy classifiers, informed by the role of tag
types and quantity.

*Chandresh Sutariya,Nitin Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lightweight CNN achieves competitive performance (37.4 dB PSNR) vs. state-of-the-art SwinIR Transformer (39.03 dB) for low-light image restoration, with 55x smaller size and 13x faster training convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the performance-efficiency trade-off in low-light image restoration, where Transformer models achieve high performance but have impractical computational costs for real-world applications.

Method: Comparative analysis between state-of-the-art SwinIR Transformer model and a standard lightweight CNN on the task of simultaneous high-frequency detail restoration and severe noise suppression in low-light images.

Result: CNN achieved 37.4 dB PSNR vs. SwinIR's 39.03 dB, but converged in only 10 epochs (vs. 132 for SwinIR) and was 55 times smaller in model size.

Conclusion: Standard CNNs can provide near state-of-the-art performance with significantly lower computational overhead, making them compelling for resource-constrained real-world applications.

Abstract: The simultaneous restoration of high-frequency details and suppression of
severe noise in low-light imagery presents a significant and persistent
challenge in computer vision. While large-scale Transformer models like SwinIR
have set the state of the art in performance, their high computational cost can
be a barrier for practical applications. This paper investigates the critical
trade-off between performance and efficiency by comparing the state-of-the-art
SwinIR model against a standard, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
on this challenging task. Our experimental results reveal a nuanced but
important finding. While the Transformer-based SwinIR model achieves a higher
peak performance, with a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 39.03 dB, the
lightweight CNN delivers a surprisingly competitive PSNR of 37.4 dB. Crucially,
the CNN reached this performance after converging in only 10 epochs of
training, whereas the more complex SwinIR model required 132 epochs. This
efficiency is further underscored by the model's size; the CNN is over 55 times
smaller than SwinIR. This work demonstrates that a standard CNN can provide a
near state-of-the-art result with significantly lower computational overhead,
presenting a compelling case for its use in real-world scenarios where resource
constraints are a primary concern.

Motivation: Event cameras offer low latency and low energy advantages ideal for constrained applications, but existing human pose estimation methods primarily use RGB cameras. This work aims to leverage event camera data for pose estimation.

Method: Proposes GraphEnet - a Graph Neural Network that uses the sparse nature of event camera output with intermediate line-based event representation. Incorporates novel offset vector learning paradigm with confidence-based pooling.

Result: First work that applies Graph Neural Networks to event data for Human Pose Estimation. Successfully estimates 2D human pose of a single person at high frequency.

Conclusion: GraphEnet demonstrates the feasibility of using Graph Neural Networks with event camera data for human pose estimation, providing a novel approach that leverages the advantages of event-based vision systems.

Abstract: Human Pose Estimation is a crucial module in human-machine interaction
applications and, especially since the rise in deep learning technology, robust
methods are available to consumers using RGB cameras and commercial GPUs. On
the other hand, event-based cameras have gained popularity in the vision
research community for their low latency and low energy advantages that make
them ideal for applications where those resources are constrained like portable

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CIR-CoT is a novel multimodal LLM that integrates explicit Chain-of-Thought reasoning for composed image retrieval, providing both improved accuracy and interpretable decision processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CIR approaches using VLMs and MLLMs function as black boxes, preventing users from understanding retrieval rationale and limiting ability to follow complex instructions.

Method: Developed end-to-end retrieval-oriented MLLM with explicit CoT reasoning, created structured CoT annotations via three-stage process (caption, reasoning, conclusion), and fine-tuned model to produce structured output before encoding final retrieval intent.

Result: Achieves highly competitive performance on in-domain datasets (FashionIQ, CIRR) and demonstrates remarkable generalization on out-of-domain CIRCO dataset.

Conclusion: Establishes new path toward more effective and trustworthy retrieval systems by making decision process transparent while improving accuracy through explicit reasoning.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR), which aims to find a target image from a
reference image and a modification text, presents the core challenge of
performing unified reasoning across visual and semantic modalities. While
current approaches based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs, e.g., CLIP) and more
recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs, e.g., Qwen-VL) have shown
progress, they predominantly function as ``black boxes." This inherent opacity
not only prevents users from understanding the retrieval rationale but also
restricts the models' ability to follow complex, fine-grained instructions. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce CIR-CoT, the first end-to-end
retrieval-oriented MLLM designed to integrate explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. By compelling the model to first generate an interpretable reasoning
chain, CIR-CoT enhances its ability to capture crucial cross-modal
interactions, leading to more accurate retrieval while making its decision
process transparent. Since existing datasets like FashionIQ and CIRR lack the
necessary reasoning data, a key contribution of our work is the creation of
structured CoT annotations using a three-stage process involving a caption,
reasoning, and conclusion. Our model is then fine-tuned to produce this
structured output before encoding its final retrieval intent into a dedicated
embedding. Comprehensive experiments show that CIR-CoT achieves highly
competitive performance on in-domain datasets (FashionIQ, CIRR) and
demonstrates remarkable generalization on the out-of-domain CIRCO dataset,
establishing a new path toward more effective and trustworthy retrieval
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Camera-based perception systems lack explicit depth information, making it difficult to generate accurate 3D object detection predictions. The ambiguity in depth estimation needs to be addressed.

Method: Proposes RayFusion, a ray-based fusion method that uses ray occupancy information from collaborators to reduce redundancy and false positive predictions along camera rays.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show the method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models and substantially advances collaborative visual perception performance.

Conclusion: RayFusion effectively enhances detection performance of purely camera-based collaborative perception systems by addressing depth estimation ambiguity through ray-based fusion.

Abstract: Collaborative visual perception methods have gained widespread attention in
the autonomous driving community in recent years due to their ability to
address sensor limitation problems. However, the absence of explicit depth
information often makes it difficult for camera-based perception systems, e.g.,
3D object detection, to generate accurate predictions. To alleviate the
ambiguity in depth estimation, we propose RayFusion, a ray-based fusion method
for collaborative visual perception. Using ray occupancy information from
collaborators, RayFusion reduces redundancy and false positive predictions
along camera rays, enhancing the detection performance of purely camera-based
collaborative perception systems. Comprehensive experiments show that our
method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, substantially
advancing the performance of collaborative visual perception. The code is

Extensive evaluations on BraTS20, BraTS21, BraTS23, and MSD datasets show substantial performance improvement with reduced computational complexity.

Conclusion: RASALoRE provides an effective and efficient solution for weakly supervised brain anomaly detection, demonstrating superior performance with minimal computational requirements compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Anomaly detection (WSAD) in brain MRI scans is an important
challenge useful to obtain quick and accurate detection of brain anomalies when
precise pixel-level anomaly annotations are unavailable and only weak labels
(e.g., slice-level) are available. In this work, we propose RASALoRE: Region
Aware Spatial Attention with Location-based Random Embeddings, a novel
two-stage WSAD framework. In the first stage, we introduce a Discriminative
Dual Prompt Tuning (DDPT) mechanism that generates high-quality pseudo weak
masks based on slice-level labels, serving as coarse localization cues. In the
second stage, we propose a segmentation network with a region-aware spatial
attention mechanism that relies on fixed location-based random embeddings. This
design enables the model to effectively focus on anomalous regions. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art anomaly detection performance, significantly

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based retouching methods require large-scale paired data, operate as black boxes, and lack adaptability for user-specific adjustments, limiting transparency and customization.

Method: The framework uses two modules: a visual critic to identify differences between input and reference images, and a code generator that produces executable codes for progressive, multi-step retouching similar to human workflow.

Result: The approach generalizes well across diverse retouching styles and enables interpretable, controllable adjustments through natural language interaction that align with user intent.

Conclusion: RetouchLLM provides a training-free, white-box solution for image retouching that offers transparency, interpretability, and user control while handling diverse adjustment needs without requiring paired training data.

Abstract: Image retouching not only enhances visual quality but also serves as a means
of expressing personal preferences and emotions. However, existing
learning-based approaches require large-scale paired data and operate as black
boxes, making the retouching process opaque and limiting their adaptability to
handle diverse, user- or image-specific adjustments. In this work, we propose
RetouchLLM, a training-free white-box image retouching system, which requires
no training data and performs interpretable, code-based retouching directly on
high-resolution images. Our framework progressively enhances the image in a
manner similar to how humans perform multi-step retouching, allowing
exploration of diverse adjustment paths. It comprises of two main modules: a
visual critic that identifies differences between the input and reference
images, and a code generator that produces executable codes. Experiments
demonstrate that our approach generalizes well across diverse retouching
styles, while natural language-based user interaction enables interpretable and
controllable adjustments tailored to user intent.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hierarchical ResNet architecture for multitemporal time series classification that uses class hierarchy information to improve discrimination at different semantic levels and handle limited training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve classification of time series multispectral images by leveraging class hierarchy information to better discriminate classes at different semantic levels and handle limited training samples through modular architecture.

Method: Modified ResNet with additional branches for hierarchical classification, using hierarchy-penalty maps to discourage incoherent transitions. Layers are trained progressively from general to specific classes using class-hierarchy labels.

Result: Experimental results on Amazonian Forest Sentinel 2 images show effective generalization across hierarchical levels and accurate micro-class classification in new target areas, with better representation of minority classes.

Conclusion: The hierarchical approach successfully improves classification accuracy at detailed levels while maintaining generalization across hierarchy levels, demonstrating effective feature learning and adaptation capability through fine-tuning.

Abstract: This work presents a multitemporal class-driven hierarchical Residual Neural
Network (ResNet) designed for modelling the classification of Time Series (TS)
of multispectral images at different semantical class levels. The architecture
consists of a modification of the ResNet where we introduce additional branches
to perform the classification at the different hierarchy levels and leverage on
hierarchy-penalty maps to discourage incoherent hierarchical transitions within
the classification. In this way, we improve the discrimination capabilities of
classes at different levels of semantic details and train a modular
architecture that can be used as a backbone network for introducing new
specific classes and additional tasks considering limited training samples
available. We exploit the class-hierarchy labels to train efficiently the
different layers of the architecture, allowing the first layers to train faster
on the first levels of the hierarchy modeling general classes (i.e., the
macro-classes) and the intermediate classes, while using the last ones to
discriminate more specific classes (i.e., the micro-classes). In this way, the
targets are constrained in following the hierarchy defined, improving the
classification of classes at the most detailed level. The proposed modular
network has intrinsic adaptation capability that can be obtained through fine
tuning. The experimental results, obtained on two tiles of the Amazonian Forest
on 12 monthly composites of Sentinel 2 images acquired during 2019, demonstrate
the effectiveness of the hierarchical approach in both generalizing over
different hierarchical levels and learning discriminant features for an
accurate classification at the micro-class level on a new target area, with a
better representation of the minoritarian classes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detection benchmarks lack specificity, diversity, and real-world relevance, failing to address the growing threat of hyper-realistic synthetic content on social media.

Method: Created RedFace dataset using 9 commercial online platforms to simulate real-world black-box scenarios, employing bespoke algorithms to capture diverse and evolving deepfake techniques used by real creators.

Result: Experimental results show limited practicality of existing deepfake detection schemes against real-world applications, with cross-domain, intra-domain, and social network dissemination simulations revealing performance gaps.

Conclusion: RedFace effectively bridges the academic-real-world gap in deepfake detection, demonstrating the need for more realistic benchmarks and highlighting limitations of current detection methods against commercial deepfake technologies.

Abstract: Deepfakes, leveraging advanced AIGC (Artificial Intelligence-Generated
Content) techniques, create hyper-realistic synthetic images and videos of
human faces, posing a significant threat to the authenticity of social media.
While this real-world threat is increasingly prevalent, existing academic
evaluations and benchmarks for detecting deepfake forgery often fall short to
achieve effective application for their lack of specificity, limited deepfake
diversity, restricted manipulation techniques.To address these limitations, we
introduce RedFace (Real-world-oriented Deepfake Face), a specialized facial
deepfake dataset, comprising over 60,000 forged images and 1,000 manipulated
videos derived from authentic facial features, to bridge the gap between
academic evaluations and real-world necessity. Unlike prior benchmarks, which
typically rely on academic methods to generate deepfakes, RedFace utilizes 9
commercial online platforms to integrate the latest deepfake technologies found
"in the wild", effectively simulating real-world black-box scenarios.Moreover,
RedFace's deepfakes are synthesized using bespoke algorithms, allowing it to
capture diverse and evolving methods used by real-world deepfake creators.
Extensive experimental results on RedFace (including cross-domain,
intra-domain, and real-world social network dissemination simulations) verify
the limited practicality of existing deepfake detection schemes against
real-world applications. We further perform a detailed analysis of the RedFace

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-generated videos have achieved near-perfect visual realism, creating an urgent need for reliable detection mechanisms to identify subtle anomalies that violate physical laws.

Method: Proposes NSG statistic based on probability flow conservation principles, uses pre-trained diffusion models for NSG estimation with spatial gradient approximation and motion-aware temporal modeling, and implements NSG-VD detection using Maximum Mean Discrepancy between NSG features.

Result: NSG-VD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 16.00% in Recall and 10.75% in F1-Score, with theoretical proof that generated videos exhibit amplified NSG discrepancies due to distributional shifts.

Conclusion: The physics-driven NSG-VD approach provides superior detection performance for AI-generated videos by capturing subtle physical anomalies through probability flow conservation principles.

Abstract: AI-generated videos have achieved near-perfect visual realism (e.g., Sora),
urgently necessitating reliable detection mechanisms. However, detecting such
videos faces significant challenges in modeling high-dimensional spatiotemporal
dynamics and identifying subtle anomalies that violate physical laws. In this
paper, we propose a physics-driven AI-generated video detection paradigm based
on probability flow conservation principles. Specifically, we propose a
statistic called Normalized Spatiotemporal Gradient (NSG), which quantifies the
ratio of spatial probability gradients to temporal density changes, explicitly
capturing deviations from natural video dynamics. Leveraging pre-trained
diffusion models, we develop an NSG estimator through spatial gradients
approximation and motion-aware temporal modeling without complex motion
decomposition while preserving physical constraints. Building on this, we

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DarkHash is the first data-free backdoor attack against deep hashing models that doesn't require access to the training dataset, maintaining original retrieval accuracy while embedding backdoor functionality through fine-tuning specific layers using surrogate data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor attacks on deep hashing models require access to training data, which is often prohibited due to privacy and intellectual property concerns. There's a need for data-free backdoor attacks that can work without the original training dataset.

Method: Proposes DarkHash with a shadow backdoor attack framework using dual-semantic guidance. Fine-tunes only specific layers of victim models using surrogate datasets, leverages sample-neighbor relationships, and uses topological alignment loss to optimize both individual and neighboring poisoned samples toward target samples.

Result: Experimental results on four image datasets, five model architectures, and two hashing methods show DarkHash outperforms existing state-of-the-art backdoor attack methods with high effectiveness. Defense experiments confirm it can withstand existing mainstream backdoor defense methods.

Conclusion: DarkHash successfully demonstrates the feasibility of data-free backdoor attacks against deep hashing models, achieving high attack effectiveness while maintaining original retrieval performance and resisting current defense mechanisms.

Abstract: Benefiting from its superior feature learning capabilities and efficiency,
deep hashing has achieved remarkable success in large-scale image retrieval.
Recent studies have demonstrated the vulnerability of deep hashing models to
backdoor attacks. Although these studies have shown promising attack results,
they rely on access to the training dataset to implant the backdoor. In the
real world, obtaining such data (e.g., identity information) is often
prohibited due to privacy protection and intellectual property concerns.
Embedding backdoors into deep hashing models without access to the training
data, while maintaining retrieval accuracy for the original task, presents a
novel and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose DarkHash, the first
data-free backdoor attack against deep hashing. Specifically, we design a novel
shadow backdoor attack framework with dual-semantic guidance. It embeds
backdoor functionality and maintains original retrieval accuracy by fine-tuning
only specific layers of the victim model using a surrogate dataset. We consider
leveraging the relationship between individual samples and their neighbors to
enhance backdoor attacks during training. By designing a topological alignment
loss, we optimize both individual and neighboring poisoned samples toward the
target sample, further enhancing the attack capability. Experimental results on
four image datasets, five model architectures, and two hashing methods
demonstrate the high effectiveness of DarkHash, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art backdoor attack methods. Defense experiments show that
DarkHash can withstand existing mainstream backdoor defense methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face parsing under extreme viewing angles is challenging due to limited labeled data, and manual annotation is costly and impractical at scale.

Result: Fine-tuning on the refined dataset significantly improves accuracy on challenging head poses while maintaining strong performance on standard views, achieving superior results compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The method offers a scalable and effective solution for improving face parsing robustness in real-world settings without requiring ground-truth 3D annotations and using only a small set of initial images.

Abstract: Accurate face parsing under extreme viewing angles remains a significant
challenge due to limited labeled data in such poses. Manual annotation is
costly and often impractical at scale. We propose a novel label refinement
pipeline that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to generate accurate
segmentation masks from noisy multiview predictions. By jointly fitting two

method enforces multiview consistency through shared geometry, enabling the
synthesis of pose-diverse training data with only minimal post-processing.
Fine-tuning a face parsing model on this refined dataset significantly improves
accuracy on challenging head poses, while maintaining strong performance on
standard views. Extensive experiments, including human evaluations, demonstrate
that our approach achieves superior results compared to state-of-the-art

*Eirik A. Østmo,Kristoffer K. Wickstrøm,Keyur Radiya,Michael C. Kampffmeyer,Karl Øyvind Mikalsen,Robert Jenssen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Random windowing, a CT-specific augmentation method that outperforms standard intensity augmentations for liver tumor segmentation by leveraging Hounsfield Unit distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard image augmentations developed for natural images are unsuitable for CT scans as they disregard the physical meaning of Hounsfield Units, leading to artifacts and poor generalization in medical image analysis.

Method: Random windowing augmentation technique that exploits the HU distribution in CT images, encouraging robustness to contrast-enhancement variations and improving performance on challenging images.

Result: The proposed method significantly increases model performance on images with poor contrast or timing, outperforming state-of-the-art alternatives in liver tumor segmentation across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: CT-specific augmentation methods like Random windowing are essential for achieving generalization in medical imaging, as they respect the physical properties of CT data unlike naive intensity augmentations.

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) is important for diagnosis and
treatment planning for various medical conditions. Deep learning (DL) based
segmentation models may enable automated medical image analysis for detecting
and delineating tumors in CT images, thereby reducing clinicians' workload.
Achieving generalization capabilities in limited data domains, such as
radiology, requires modern DL models to be trained with image augmentation.
However, naively applying augmentation methods developed for natural images to
CT scans often disregards the nature of the CT modality, where the intensities
measure Hounsfield Units (HU) and have important physical meaning. This paper
challenges the use of such intensity augmentations for CT imaging and shows
that they may lead to artifacts and poor generalization. To mitigate this, we
propose a CT-specific augmentation technique, called Random windowing, that
exploits the available HU distribution of intensities in CT images. Random
windowing encourages robustness to contrast-enhancement and significantly
increases model performance on challenging images with poor contrast or timing.
We perform ablations and analysis of our method on multiple datasets, and
compare to, and outperform, state-of-the-art alternatives, while focusing on
the challenge of liver tumor segmentation.

TL;DR: AR-Drag is a reinforcement learning-enhanced autoregressive video diffusion model that enables real-time image-to-video generation with precise motion control, achieving high visual quality while reducing latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in real-time motion-controllable video generation, including latency issues with bidirectional diffusion models and limitations of existing autoregressive approaches that suffer from quality degradation and motion artifacts.

Method: Fine-tunes a base image-to-video model for basic motion control, then enhances it via reinforcement learning with a trajectory-based reward model. Uses Self-Rollout mechanism to preserve Markov property and selective stochasticity in denoising steps to accelerate training.

Result: Achieves high visual fidelity and precise motion alignment with only 1.3B parameters, significantly reducing latency compared to state-of-the-art motion-controllable video diffusion models.

Conclusion: AR-Drag successfully enables real-time motion-controllable video generation with improved quality and reduced latency, demonstrating the effectiveness of RL-enhanced autoregressive approaches for this challenging task.

Abstract: Real-time motion-controllable video generation remains challenging due to the
inherent latency of bidirectional diffusion models and the lack of effective
autoregressive (AR) approaches. Existing AR video diffusion models are limited
to simple control signals or text-to-video generation, and often suffer from
quality degradation and motion artifacts in few-step generation. To address
these challenges, we propose AR-Drag, the first RL-enhanced few-step AR video
diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation with diverse motion
control. We first fine-tune a base I2V model to support basic motion control,
then further improve it via reinforcement learning with a trajectory-based
reward model. Our design preserves the Markov property through a Self-Rollout
mechanism and accelerates training by selectively introducing stochasticity in
denoising steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AR-Drag achieves high
visual fidelity and precise motion alignment, significantly reducing latency
compared with state-of-the-art motion-controllable VDMs, while using only 1.3B
parameters. Additional visualizations can be found on our project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes self-contradiction in Video-LLMs and proposes TCAS method to improve temporal logic consistency by enhancing cross-modal attention heads' temporal discrimination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often generate self-contradictory outputs, which severely impacts reliability and hinders practical adoption. Video-LLMs fail to provide logically consistent responses to rephrased questions based on their grounding outputs, but the underlying causes remain underexplored.

Method: Adopts interpretability-driven approach to analyze factors, identifies cross-modal attention heads' inability to distinguish video tokens across timestamps as primary cause, and proposes Temporally Conditioned Attention Sharpening (TCAS) method that constructs enhancement objective based on attention distinctions to improve temporal resolution.

Result: Experimental results show TCAS significantly enhances temporal logic consistency of Video-LLMs, improves temporal discriminability of attention heads, and achieves performance improvements in general video temporal grounding tasks.

Conclusion: Temporal logic consistency is a bottleneck in temporal understanding, and by enhancing consistency through TCAS, the method drives significant progress in video temporal understanding.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate self-contradictory outputs, which
severely impacts their reliability and hinders their adoption in practical
applications. In video-language models (Video-LLMs), this phenomenon recently
draws the attention of researchers. Specifically, these models fail to provide
logically consistent responses to rephrased questions based on their grounding
outputs. However, the underlying causes of this phenomenon remain
underexplored. In this work, we adopt an interpretability-driven approach to
analyze, statistically summarize, and intervention the potential factors of the
phenomenon. We find that one of the primary reasons for the inconsistency in
responses lies in the inability of cross-modal attention heads to effectively
distinguish video tokens across different timestamps. To address this, we
propose an attention enhancement method called Temporally Conditioned Attention
Sharpening (TCAS), which constructs an enhancement objective based on attention
distinctions to enhance the model's temporal resolution capability, thereby
improving its temporal understanding logic consistency. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the temporal logic
consistency of Video-LLMs. Further interpretability analyses reveal that our
method indeed improves the temporal discriminability of attention heads,
validating our conclusions. Additionally, our method achieves performance
improvements in general video temporal grounding tasks, highlighting that
temporal logic consistency is a bottleneck in temporal understanding. By
enhancing consistency, our method drives significant progress in video temporal
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniMMVSR is the first unified generative video super-resolution framework that incorporates hybrid-modal conditions (text, images, videos) to enhance video generation fidelity, outperforming existing methods and enabling 4K video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cascaded video super-resolution methods are limited to text-to-video tasks and fail to leverage additional generative conditions beyond text, which are crucial for ensuring fidelity in multi-modal video generation.

Method: The framework explores condition injection strategies, training schemes, and data mixture techniques within a latent video diffusion model, with distinct data construction and condition utilization methods to precisely use all condition types.

Result: UniMMVSR significantly outperforms existing methods, producing videos with superior detail and higher conformity to multi-modal conditions, and enables multi-modal guided generation of 4K video when combined with a base model.

Conclusion: The proposed UniMMVSR framework successfully addresses the limitation of existing methods by incorporating hybrid-modal conditions, demonstrating superior performance and enabling previously unattainable 4K video generation capabilities.

Abstract: Cascaded video super-resolution has emerged as a promising technique for
decoupling the computational burden associated with generating high-resolution
videos using large foundation models. Existing studies, however, are largely
confined to text-to-video tasks and fail to leverage additional generative
conditions beyond text, which are crucial for ensuring fidelity in multi-modal
video generation. We address this limitation by presenting UniMMVSR, the first
unified generative video super-resolution framework to incorporate hybrid-modal
conditions, including text, images, and videos. We conduct a comprehensive
exploration of condition injection strategies, training schemes, and data
mixture techniques within a latent video diffusion model. A key challenge was
designing distinct data construction and condition utilization methods to
enable the model to precisely utilize all condition types, given their varied
correlations with the target video. Our experiments demonstrate that UniMMVSR
significantly outperforms existing methods, producing videos with superior
detail and a higher degree of conformity to multi-modal conditions. We also
validate the feasibility of combining UniMMVSR with a base model to achieve
multi-modal guided generation of 4K video, a feat previously unattainable with
existing techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MURE is a novel multimodal framework that uses interleaved text-image Chain-of-Thought reasoning for precise image editing, addressing limitations of purely textual reasoning by incorporating visual cues and introducing Multimodal Deep Confidence to ensure high-quality editing trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image editing methods struggle with complex object intersections and fine-grained spatial relationships due to lack of explicit reasoning processes. Purely textual Chain-of-Thought approaches are fundamentally limited in representing intricate visual layouts and lack visual cues for pixel-level detail generation.

Method: Proposes MURE framework with interleaved text-image CoT reasoning, where textual descriptions are followed by visual cues like positional masks or content representations. Introduces Multimodal Deep Confidence reasoning that explores multiple visual reasoning paths and prunes low-quality branches using reward model confidence scores.

Result: The method decomposes complex editing tasks into interdependent sub-tasks, achieving greater precision at each stage. Extensive experiments show significant improvements across three image editing benchmarks. Created CoT-Edit-14K dataset with 14K high-quality editing examples.

Conclusion: MURE successfully shifts visual editing from purely text-based reasoning to multimodal interleaved reasoning, enabling more precise handling of complex spatial relationships and yielding high-fidelity edited results through systematic decomposition of editing tasks.

Abstract: Image editing with natural language has gained significant popularity, yet
existing methods struggle with intricate object intersections and fine-grained
spatial relationships due to the lack of an explicit reasoning process. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has been explored to enhance reasoning, purely textual
CoT or CoT augmented with coordinate information is fundamentally limited in
its ability to represent intricate visual layouts and lacks the necessary
visual cues to guide the generation of fine-grained, pixel-level details. To
address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Reasoning Edit (MURE), a novel
framework that shifts the visual editing process from purely text-based
reasoning to a series of interleaved textual and visual rationales. Our
framework performs image editing using a natively multimodal, interleaved
text-image CoT. This approach generates a step-by-step chain of reasoning where
a textual description is followed by a corresponding visual cue, such as a
positional mask that defined intended edited regions or a representation of new
content. Furthermore, to mitigate the hallucination phenomenon of large
language models, we introduce Multimodal Deep Confidence (MMDC) reasoning
paradigm. This paradigm explores a tree of visual reasoning paths at each step.
By pruning low-quality branches using a deep confidence score from a reward
model, it ensures the model consistently follows a high-quality trajectory
towards the final edited result. The proposed method decomposes complex editing
tasks into interdependent sub-tasks, achieving greater precision at each stage
and yielding high-fidelity edited results. We define the formulation for
interleaved text-image chains and release the first CoT-Edit-14K dataset,
comprising 14K high-quality editing examples. Extensive experiments show that
our method yields significant improvements across three image editing
benchmarks.

*Johann Schmidt,Sebastian Stober*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A bootstrapping method for fine-grained visual classification that iteratively re-aligns training samples to handle geometric biases without requiring aligned training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained visual classification requires sensitivity to subtle cues while being robust to spatial transformations. Existing methods rely on heavy data augmentation or equivariant architectures, which have limitations in expressivity and cost.

Method: Proposed a bootstrapping algorithm that iteratively re-aligns training samples by progressively reducing variance and recovering the alignment assumption, with convergence guarantees for arbitrary compact groups.

Result: The method consistently outperforms equivariant and canonicalization baselines on four FGVC benchmarks while performing on par with augmentation-based approaches.

Conclusion: The bootstrapping approach provides an effective alternative to existing methods for handling geometric biases in fine-grained visual classification tasks.

Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) tasks, such as insect and bird
identification, demand sensitivity to subtle visual cues while remaining robust
to spatial transformations. A key challenge is handling geometric biases and
noise, such as different orientations and scales of objects. Existing remedies
rely on heavy data augmentation, which demands powerful models, or on
equivariant architectures, which constrain expressivity and add cost.
Canonicalization offers an alternative by shielding such biases from the
downstream model. In practice, such functions are often obtained using
canonicalization priors, which assume aligned training data. Unfortunately,
real-world datasets never fulfill this assumption, causing the obtained
canonicalizer to be brittle. We propose a bootstrapping algorithm that
iteratively re-aligns training samples by progressively reducing variance and
recovering the alignment assumption. We establish convergence guarantees under
mild conditions for arbitrary compact groups, and show on four FGVC benchmarks
that our method consistently outperforms equivariant, and canonicalization
baselines while performing on par with augmentation.

*Haoran Yu,Yi Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstructUDrag is a diffusion-based framework that combines text instructions with object dragging for simultaneous object relocation and text-based image editing, addressing limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-based image editing methods struggle with precise object positioning, while object dragging methods are limited to static relocation. The authors aim to overcome these limitations by integrating both approaches.

Method: The framework treats object dragging as image reconstruction with two branches: moving-reconstruction branch uses energy-based gradient guidance and refined cross-attention maps for accurate object relocation, and text-driven editing branch shares gradient signals for consistent transformations. It employs DDPM inversion and prior information injection to preserve object structure.

Result: Extensive experiments show that InstructUDrag enables flexible, high-fidelity image editing with precision in object relocation and semantic control over image content.

Conclusion: The proposed InstructUDrag framework successfully combines text instructions with object dragging, providing both precise object positioning and semantic editing capabilities in a unified approach.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have shown great potential for image editing,
with techniques such as text-based and object-dragging methods emerging as key
approaches. However, each of these methods has inherent limitations: text-based
methods struggle with precise object positioning, while object dragging methods
are confined to static relocation. To address these issues, we propose
InstructUDrag, a diffusion-based framework that combines text instructions with
object dragging, enabling simultaneous object dragging and text-based image
editing. Our framework treats object dragging as an image reconstruction
process, divided into two synergistic branches. The moving-reconstruction
branch utilizes energy-based gradient guidance to move objects accurately,
refining cross-attention maps to enhance relocation precision. The text-driven
editing branch shares gradient signals with the reconstruction branch, ensuring
consistent transformations and allowing fine-grained control over object
attributes. We also employ DDPM inversion and inject prior information into
noise maps to preserve the structure of moved objects. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that InstructUDrag facilitates flexible, high-fidelity image
editing, offering both precision in object relocation and semantic control over
image content.

*Mu Li,Yin Wang,Zhiying Leng,Jiapeng Liu,Frederick W. B. Li,Xiaohui Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FineDual is a tri-stage method for dual-human motion generation that models dynamic hierarchical interaction from individual to inter-individual levels, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods model human interaction temporally invariantly, ignoring the dynamic nature of motion changes with distance and the hierarchical structure from individual to inter-individual to overall motion.

Method: Three-stage approach: 1) Self-Learning Stage uses LLM to divide dual-human text into individual texts and align features; 2) Adaptive Adjustment Stage predicts interaction distance and models interactions dynamically via graph network; 3) Teacher-Guided Refinement Stage uses overall text features to refine motion features.

Result: Extensive evaluations on dual-human motion datasets demonstrate that FineDual outperforms existing approaches in generating fine-grained and high-quality dual-human motion.

Conclusion: FineDual effectively models dynamic hierarchical human interaction by exploiting the inherent dynamic and hierarchical properties of human interaction.

Abstract: Human interaction is inherently dynamic and hierarchical, where the dynamic
refers to the motion changes with distance, and the hierarchy is from
individual to inter-individual and ultimately to overall motion. Exploiting
these properties is vital for dual-human motion generation, while existing
methods almost model human interaction temporally invariantly, ignoring
distance and hierarchy. To address it, we propose a fine-grained dual-human
motion generation method, namely FineDual, a tri-stage method to model the
dynamic hierarchical interaction from individual to inter-individual. The first
stage, Self-Learning Stage, divides the dual-human overall text into individual
texts through a Large Language Model, aligning text features and motion
features at the individual level. The second stage, Adaptive Adjustment Stage,
predicts interaction distance by an interaction distance predictor, modeling
human interactions dynamically at the inter-individual level by an
interaction-aware graph network. The last stage, Teacher-Guided Refinement
Stage, utilizes overall text features as guidance to refine motion features at
the overall level, generating fine-grained and high-quality dual-human motion.
Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on dual-human motion
datasets demonstrate that our proposed FineDual outperforms existing
approaches, effectively modeling dynamic hierarchical human interaction.

TL;DR: AdaGC is a novel framework for single-positive multi-label learning in remote sensing that uses adaptive gradient calibration to handle supervision ambiguity and achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-label classification provides better semantic understanding of remote sensing imagery but complete annotations are expensive. Single-positive multi-label learning offers a scalable alternative but introduces supervision ambiguity that requires specialized solutions.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Gradient Calibration (AdaGC) framework with gradient calibration mechanism, Mixup, dual exponential moving average module for pseudo-label generation, and adaptive triggering based on training dynamics.

Result: Extensive experiments on two benchmark RS datasets show AdaGC achieves state-of-the-art performance and maintains strong robustness across diverse settings and label noise types.

Conclusion: AdaGC effectively bridges the gap in SPML research for remote sensing, providing a generalizable framework that mitigates overfitting to label noise and achieves superior performance.

Abstract: Multi-label classification (MLC) offers a more comprehensive semantic
understanding of Remote Sensing (RS) imagery compared to traditional
single-label classification (SLC). However, obtaining complete annotations for
MLC is particularly challenging due to the complexity and high cost of the
labeling process. As a practical alternative, single-positive multi-label
learning (SPML) has emerged, where each image is annotated with only one
relevant label, and the model is expected to recover the full set of labels.
While scalable, SPML introduces significant supervision ambiguity, demanding
specialized solutions for model training. Although various SPML methods have
been proposed in the computer vision domain, research in the RS context remains
limited. To bridge this gap, we propose Adaptive Gradient Calibration (AdaGC),
a novel and generalizable SPML framework tailored to RS imagery. AdaGC adopts a
gradient calibration (GC) mechanism combined with Mixup and a dual exponential
moving average (EMA) module for robust pseudo-label generation. To maximize
AdaGC's effectiveness, we introduce a simple yet theoretically grounded
indicator to adaptively trigger GC after an initial warm-up stage based on
training dynamics, thereby guaranteeing the effectiveness of GC in mitigating
overfitting to label noise. Extensive experiments on two benchmark RS datasets
under two distinct label noise types demonstrate that AdaGC achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while maintaining strong robustness across
diverse settings.

*Haipeng Liu,Yang Wang,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NTN-Diff is a frequency-aware diffusion model for text-guided image inpainting that decomposes semantics consistency across frequency bands and uses null-text guidance to preserve unmasked regions while achieving semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods failed to simultaneously preserve unmasked regions and achieve semantic consistency between masked and unmasked areas due to entanglement of hybrid frequency bands during denoising.

Method: Proposes null-text-null frequency-aware diffusion model that divides denoising into early and late stages, disentangling mid-and-low frequency bands. Uses stable mid-frequency as guidance for null-text denoising of low-frequency in masked regions.

Result: Extensive experiments show NTN-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion models for text-guided image inpainting, achieving better preservation of unmasked regions and semantic consistency.

Conclusion: NTN-Diff successfully addresses both challenges in text-guided inpainting by frequency band decomposition and staged denoising with null-text guidance, enabling superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting aims at reconstructing the masked regions as per
text prompts, where the longstanding challenges lie in the preservation for
unmasked regions, while achieving the semantics consistency between unmasked
and inpainted masked regions. Previous arts failed to address both of them,
always with either of them to be remedied. Such facts, as we observed, stem
from the entanglement of the hybrid (e.g., mid-and-low) frequency bands that
encode varied image properties, which exhibit different robustness to text
prompts during the denoising process. In this paper, we propose a
null-text-null frequency-aware diffusion models, dubbed \textbf{NTN-Diff}, for
text-guided image inpainting, by decomposing the semantics consistency across
masked and unmasked regions into the consistencies as per each frequency band,
while preserving the unmasked regions, to circumvent two challenges in a row.
Based on the diffusion process, we further divide the denoising process into
early (high-level noise) and late (low-level noise) stages, where the
mid-and-low frequency bands are disentangled during the denoising process. As
observed, the stable mid-frequency band is progressively denoised to be
semantically aligned during text-guided denoising process, which, meanwhile,
serves as the guidance to the null-text denoising process to denoise
low-frequency band for the masked regions, followed by a subsequent text-guided
denoising process at late stage, to achieve the semantics consistency for
mid-and-low frequency bands across masked and unmasked regions, while preserve
the unmasked regions. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of
NTN-Diff over the state-of-the-art diffusion models to text-guided diffusion
models. Our code can be accessed from https://github.com/htyjers/NTN-Diff.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior open-vocabulary object detection methods fail in ambiguous scenarios with multiple candidate objects, requiring better integration of linguistic and embodied cues for reliable referent detection.

Method: Proposed ERU framework with three key components: LLM-based data augmentation for training data generation, depth-map modality for spatial understanding, and depth-aware decision module for robust cue integration.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing baselines on two datasets, achieving more accurate and reliable referent detection in complex or cluttered environments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses ambiguity in embodied reference understanding by jointly leveraging multiple modalities and demonstrates superior performance over current methods.

Abstract: Embodied Reference Understanding requires identifying a target object in a
visual scene based on both language instructions and pointing cues. While prior
works have shown progress in open-vocabulary object detection, they often fail
in ambiguous scenarios where multiple candidate objects exist in the scene. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel ERU framework that jointly
leverages LLM-based data augmentation, depth-map modality, and a depth-aware
decision module. This design enables robust integration of linguistic and
embodied cues, improving disambiguation in complex or cluttered environments.
Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving more accurate and

Method: Proposes learning a neural field that predicts optimal exposure value per 3D point, with joint optimization of scene representation and exposure field via a novel neural conditioning mechanism.

Result: Trains faster than prior works and achieves state-of-the-art results, improving by over 55% over best-performing baselines on several benchmarks.

Conclusion: NExF enables accurate view synthesis in high dynamic range scenarios without post-processing or multi-exposure captures, producing high-quality 3D-consistent appearance from challenging real-world data.

Abstract: Recent advances in neural scene representations have led to unprecedented
quality in 3D reconstruction and view synthesis. Despite achieving high-quality
results for common benchmarks with curated data, outputs often degrade for data
that contain per image variations such as strong exposure changes, present,
e.g., in most scenes with indoor and outdoor areas or rooms with windows. In
this paper, we introduce Neural Exposure Fields (NExF), a novel technique for
robustly reconstructing 3D scenes with high quality and 3D-consistent
appearance from challenging real-world captures. In the core, we propose to
learn a neural field predicting an optimal exposure value per 3D point,
enabling us to optimize exposure along with the neural scene representation.
While capture devices such as cameras select optimal exposure per image/pixel,
we generalize this concept and perform optimization in 3D instead. This enables
accurate view synthesis in high dynamic range scenarios, bypassing the need of
post-processing steps or multi-exposure captures. Our contributions include a
novel neural representation for exposure prediction, a system for joint
optimization of the scene representation and the exposure field via a novel
neural conditioning mechanism, and demonstrated superior performance on
challenging real-world data. We find that our approach trains faster than prior
works and produces state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks improving by
over 55% over best-performing baselines.

### [69] [LTCA: Long-range Temporal Context Attention for Referring Video Object Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08305)
*Cilin Yan,Jingyun Wang,Guoliang Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes LTCA mechanism for referring video segmentation that balances local and global temporal context through stacked sparse local attentions and global query interactions, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods fail to balance locality and globality in temporal context extraction, with computation complexity increasing significantly with video length.

Method: Uses stacked sparse local attentions with dilated window attention across frames, plus random global key selection and global query interactions to aggregate global context.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art on four benchmarks with 11.3% and 8.3% improvements on MeViS valu and val datasets respectively.

Conclusion: LTCA effectively balances local and global temporal context extraction while maintaining computational efficiency, significantly advancing referring video segmentation performance.

Abstract: Referring Video Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment objects in videos given
linguistic expressions. The key to solving RVOS is to extract long-range
temporal context information from the interactions of expressions and videos to
depict the dynamic attributes of each object. Previous works either adopt
attention across all the frames or stack dense local attention to achieve a
global view of temporal context. However, they fail to strike a good balance
between locality and globality, and the computation complexity significantly
increases with the increase of video length. In this paper, we propose an
effective long-range temporal context attention (LTCA) mechanism to aggregate
global context information into object features. Specifically, we aggregate the
global context information from two aspects. Firstly, we stack sparse local
attentions to balance the locality and globality. We design a dilated window
attention across frames to aggregate local context information and perform such
attention in a stack of layers to enable a global view. Further, we enable each
query to attend to a small group of keys randomly selected from a global pool
to enhance the globality. Secondly, we design a global query to interact with
all the other queries to directly encode the global context information.
Experiments show our method achieves new state-of-the-art on four referring
video segmentation benchmarks. Notably, our method shows an improvement of
11.3% and 8.3% on the MeViS valu and val datasets respectively.

*Yu Huang,Zelin Peng,Changsong Wen,Xiaokang Yang,Wei Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new framework for 3D affordance segmentation that transfers semantic knowledge from 2D Vision Foundation Models to address challenges in 3D data processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on generic point cloud encoders that overlook 3D data challenges like sparsity, noise, and geometric ambiguity, leading to poor functional boundary definition in affordance segmentation.

Method: Proposes Cross-Modal Affinity Transfer (CMAT) pre-training to align 3D encoder with 2D semantics, and Cross-modal Affordance Segmentation Transformer (CAST) that integrates multi-modal prompts with CMAT-pretrained features.

Result: Extensive experiments show the framework establishes new state-of-the-art results for 3D affordance segmentation on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: The semantic-grounded learning paradigm effectively bridges 2D semantic knowledge with 3D processing to achieve superior affordance segmentation performance.

Abstract: Affordance segmentation aims to parse 3D objects into functionally distinct
parts, bridging recognition and interaction for applications in robotic
manipulation, embodied AI, and AR. While recent studies leverage visual or
textual prompts to guide this process, they often rely on point cloud encoders
as generic feature extractors, overlooking the intrinsic challenges of 3D data
such as sparsity, noise, and geometric ambiguity. As a result, 3D features
learned in isolation frequently lack clear and semantically consistent
functional boundaries. To address this bottleneck, we propose a
semantic-grounded learning paradigm that transfers rich semantic knowledge from
large-scale 2D Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) into the 3D domain.
Specifically, We introduce Cross-Modal Affinity Transfer (CMAT), a pre-training
strategy that aligns a 3D encoder with lifted 2D semantics and jointly
optimizes reconstruction, affinity, and diversity to yield semantically
organized representations. Building on this backbone, we further design the
Cross-modal Affordance Segmentation Transformer (CAST), which integrates
multi-modal prompts with CMAT-pretrained features to generate precise,
prompt-aware segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework establishes new state-of-the-art results for 3D
affordance segmentation.

*Yushi Huang,Xingtong Ge,Ruihao Gong,Chengtao Lv,Jun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LinVideo is an efficient post-training framework that replaces self-attention with linear attention in video diffusion models, achieving 1.25-2.00x speedup while preserving quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video diffusion models have quadratic computation costs due to self-attention, making them computationally expensive for long sequences. Linear attention offers lower cost but requires expensive pretraining and has limited expressiveness.

Method: Proposes selective transfer to automatically identify which layers to convert to linear attention, and introduces anytime distribution matching (ADM) objective to align sample distributions across timesteps during transfer.

Result: Achieves 1.25-2.00x speedup while preserving generation quality. The 4-step distilled model further achieves 15.92x latency reduction with minimal visual quality drop.

Conclusion: LinVideo provides an effective data-free post-training approach to reduce computational costs in video diffusion models without sacrificing performance, enabling more efficient video generation.

Abstract: Video diffusion models (DMs) have enabled high-quality video synthesis.
However, their computation costs scale quadratically with sequence length
because self-attention has quadratic complexity. While linear attention lowers
the cost, fully replacing quadratic attention requires expensive pretraining
due to the limited expressiveness of linear attention and the complexity of
spatiotemporal modeling in video generation. In this paper, we present
LinVideo, an efficient data-free post-training framework that replaces a target
number of self-attention modules with linear attention while preserving the
original model's performance. First, we observe a significant disparity in the
replaceability of different layers. Instead of manual or heuristic choices, we
frame layer selection as a binary classification problem and propose selective
transfer, which automatically and progressively converts layers to linear
attention with minimal performance impact. Additionally, to overcome the
ineffectiveness and inefficiency of existing objectives for this transfer
process, we introduce an anytime distribution matching (ADM) objective that
aligns the distributions of samples across any timestep along the sampling
trajectory. This objective is efficient and recovers model performance.
Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a 1.25-2.00x speedup while
preserving generation quality, and our 4-step distilled model further delivers
a 15.92x latency reduction with minimal visual quality drop.

*Nikos Theodoridis,Tim Brophy,Reenu Mohandas,Ganesh Sistu,Fiachra Collins,Anthony Scanlan,Ciaran Eising*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DTPQA, a perception-focused VQA benchmark for traffic scenes with distance annotations, and shows that small VLMs significantly underperform humans on this task despite the simple perception-only questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop reliable perception systems for automated driving that can handle both close and long-range objects, and to evaluate small VLMs suitable for resource-constrained hardware.

Method: Created DTPQA benchmark with distance-annotated perception questions (excluding reasoning), then evaluated several state-of-the-art small VLMs on this benchmark and compared with human performance.

Result: Small VLMs achieved only ~60% average accuracy compared to ~85% human performance, with specific challenges in tasks like distinguishing left from right. Human sample size was small, limiting statistical power.

Conclusion: Current small VLMs have significant limitations in traffic scene perception, particularly for distance-related tasks and basic spatial distinctions, highlighting the need for improved perception capabilities in safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly powerful,
demonstrating strong performance on a variety of tasks that require both visual
and textual understanding. Their strong generalisation abilities make them a
promising component for automated driving systems, which must handle unexpected
corner cases. However, to be trusted in such safety-critical applications, a
model must first possess a reliable perception system. Moreover, since critical
objects and agents in traffic scenes are often at a distance, we require
systems that are not "shortsighted", i.e., systems with strong perception
capabilities at both close (up to 20 meters) and long (30+ meters) range. With
this in mind, we introduce Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question
Answering (DTPQA), the first Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark focused
solely on perception-based questions in traffic scenes, enriched with distance
annotations. By excluding questions that require reasoning, we ensure that
model performance reflects perception capabilities alone. Since automated
driving hardware has limited processing power and cannot support large VLMs,
our study centers on smaller VLMs. More specifically, we evaluate several
state-of-the-art (SOTA) small VLMs on DTPQA and show that, despite the
simplicity of the questions, these models significantly underperform compared
to humans (~60% average accuracy for the best-performing small VLM versus ~85%
human performance). However, it is important to note that the human sample size
was relatively small, which imposes statistical limitations. We also identify
specific perception tasks, such as distinguishing left from right, that remain
particularly challenging for these models.

Abstract: We introduce a simple and efficient method to enhance and clarify images.
More specifically, we deal with low light image enhancement and clarification
of hazy imagery (hazy/foggy images, images containing sand dust, and underwater

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A data augmentation method using guided diffusion models with lightweight transformers and modified loss functions for hyperspectral forest classification with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning for hyperspectral land-cover classification faces overfitting risks with small labeled datasets, requiring effective data augmentation techniques.

Method: Proposed guided diffusion model for data augmentation, implemented with lightweight transformer network, modified weighted loss function, and optimized cosine variance scheduler.

Result: Outperformed other data augmentation techniques in forest classification with 10 forest types using PRISMA satellite hyperspectral images, achieving better average and weighted average accuracy with stable training.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses overfitting in small datasets and provides stable training for deep generative models in hyperspectral data augmentation applications.

Abstract: The introduction of new generation hyperspectral satellite sensors, combined
with advancements in deep learning methodologies, has significantly enhanced
the ability to discriminate detailed land-cover classes at medium-large scales.
However, a significant challenge in deep learning methods is the risk of
overfitting when training networks with small labeled datasets. In this work,
we propose a data augmentation technique that leverages a guided diffusion
model. To effectively train the model with a limited number of labeled samples
and to capture complex patterns in the data, we implement a lightweight
transformer network. Additionally, we introduce a modified weighted loss
function and an optimized cosine variance scheduler, which facilitate fast and
effective training on small datasets. We evaluate the effectiveness of the
proposed method on a forest classification task with 10 different forest types
using hyperspectral images acquired by the PRISMA satellite. The results
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other data augmentation
techniques in both average and weighted average accuracy. The effectiveness of
the method is further highlighted by the stable training behavior of the model,
which addresses a common limitation in the practical application of deep
generative models for data augmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniVideo is a unified multimodal framework that extends unified modeling to video generation and editing, supporting diverse tasks under a single instruction paradigm with dual-stream architecture combining MLLM for instruction understanding and MMDiT for video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unified multimodal models are largely limited to the image domain, lacking comprehensive video generation and editing capabilities under a unified framework.

Method: Dual-stream design combining Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for instruction understanding and Multimodal DiT (MMDiT) for video generation, with joint training across multiple video tasks.

Result: Matches or surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific baselines in text/image-to-video generation, in-context video generation and editing. Enables task composition and generalization to unseen editing instructions without explicit training.

Conclusion: UniVideo successfully extends unified multimodal modeling to video domain, demonstrating strong performance across diverse tasks and enabling novel capabilities like task composition and transfer learning from image editing data.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have shown promising results in multimodal content
generation and editing but remain largely limited to the image domain. In this
work, we present UniVideo, a versatile framework that extends unified modeling
to the video domain. UniVideo adopts a dual-stream design, combining a
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for instruction understanding with a
Multimodal DiT (MMDiT) for video generation. This design enables accurate
interpretation of complex multimodal instructions while preserving visual
consistency. Built on this architecture, UniVideo unifies diverse video
generation and editing tasks under a single multimodal instruction paradigm and
is jointly trained across them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniVideo
matches or surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific baselines in
text/image-to-video generation, in-context video generation and in-context
video editing. Notably, the unified design of UniVideo enables two forms of
generalization. First, UniVideo supports task composition, such as combining
editing with style transfer, by integrating multiple capabilities within a
single instruction. Second, even without explicit training on free-form video
editing, UniVideo transfers its editing capability from large-scale image
editing data to this setting, handling unseen instructions such as
green-screening characters or changing materials within a video. Beyond these
core capabilities, UniVideo also supports visual-prompt-based video generation,
where the MLLM interprets visual prompts and guides the MMDiT during synthesis.
To foster future research, we will release our model and code.

TL;DR: A method combining LayoutLMv3 for layout detection and GPT-4o with in-context learning to automatically extract and link legend symbols with their descriptions from historical maps using bounding box predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical map legends are crucial for interpreting cartographic symbols but their inconsistent layouts and unstructured formats make automatic extraction challenging. Existing methods focus mainly on segmentation or OCR without effectively matching symbols to descriptions.

Method: Combines LayoutLMv3 for layout detection with GPT-4o using in-context learning to detect and link legend items and descriptions via bounding box predictions. Uses structured JSON prompts for better performance.

Result: GPT-4 with structured JSON prompts achieves 88% F-1 score and 85% IoU, outperforming baseline methods. Performance is influenced by prompt design, example counts, and layout alignment.

Conclusion: This approach enables scalable, layout-aware legend parsing and improves indexing and searchability of historical maps across various visual styles.

Abstract: Historical map legends are critical for interpreting cartographic symbols.
However, their inconsistent layouts and unstructured formats make automatic
extraction challenging. Prior work focuses primarily on segmentation or general
optical character recognition (OCR), with few methods effectively matching
legend symbols to their corresponding descriptions in a structured manner. We
present a method that combines LayoutLMv3 for layout detection with GPT-4o
using in-context learning to detect and link legend items and their
descriptions via bounding box predictions. Our experiments show that GPT-4 with
structured JSON prompts outperforms the baseline, achieving 88% F-1 and 85%

performance. This approach supports scalable, layout-aware legend parsing and
improves the indexing and searchability of historical maps across various

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A curriculum-based source-free domain adaptation framework called LFC that uses easy-to-hard and source-to-target curricula to progressively adapt models without accessing source data, achieving state-of-the-art performance on medical image segmentation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data privacy and security concerns in medical imaging by enabling domain adaptation without using source data, while improving adaptation quality through progressive learning.

Method: Proposes LFC framework with two curricula: easy-to-hard curriculum starts with easy samples and gradually increases difficulty, and source-to-target curriculum ensures smooth transfer from source to target domain.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on cross-domain datasets for fundus segmentation and polyp segmentation, surpassing existing source-free domain adaptation approaches.

Conclusion: The curriculum-based approach effectively enables source-free domain adaptation for medical images, providing both privacy protection and improved adaptation performance through progressive learning strategies.

Abstract: Recent studies have uncovered a new research line, namely source-free domain
adaptation, which adapts a model to target domains without using the source
data. Such a setting can address the concerns on data privacy and security
issues of medical images. However, current source-free domain adaptation
frameworks mainly focus on the pseudo label refinement for target data without
the consideration of learning procedure. Indeed, a progressive learning process
from source to target domain will benefit the knowledge transfer during model
adaptation. To this end, we propose a curriculum-based framework, namely
learning from curriculum (LFC), for source-free domain adaptation, which
consists of easy-to-hard and source-to-target curricula. Concretely, the former
curriculum enables the framework to start learning with `easy' samples and
gradually tune the optimization direction of model adaption by increasing the
sample difficulty. While, the latter can stablize the adaptation process, which
ensures smooth transfer of the model from the source domain to the target. We
evaluate the proposed source-free domain adaptation approach on the public
cross-domain datasets for fundus segmentation and polyp segmentation. The
extensive experimental results show that our framework surpasses the existing
approaches and achieves a new state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: VideoVerse is a new benchmark for evaluating Text-to-Video models, focusing on temporal causality and world knowledge understanding rather than traditional metrics like aesthetic quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2V benchmarks are insufficient for state-of-the-art models as they don't evaluate temporal causality and world knowledge, which are crucial for building world models.

Method: Collect diverse videos across multiple domains, extract event-level descriptions with temporal causality, rewrite them into T2V prompts, and design binary evaluation questions across 10 dimensions. Use vision-language models for human-preference-aligned evaluation.

Result: Created VideoVerse with 300 curated prompts, 815 events, and 793 binary evaluation questions. Systematically evaluated both open-source and closed-source T2V models.

Conclusion: VideoVerse provides comprehensive assessment of T2V models' capabilities in understanding temporal causality and world knowledge, revealing how far current models are from true world models.

Abstract: The recent rapid advancement of Text-to-Video (T2V) generation technologies,
which are critical to build ``world models'', makes the existing benchmarks
increasingly insufficient to evaluate state-of-the-art T2V models. First,
current evaluation dimensions, such as per-frame aesthetic quality and temporal
consistency, are no longer able to differentiate state-of-the-art T2V models.
Second, event-level temporal causality, which not only distinguishes video from
other modalities but also constitutes a crucial component of world models, is
severely underexplored in existing benchmarks. Third, existing benchmarks lack
a systematic assessment of world knowledge, which are essential capabilities
for building world models. To address these issues, we introduce VideoVerse, a
comprehensive benchmark that focuses on evaluating whether a T2V model could
understand complex temporal causality and world knowledge in the real world. We
collect representative videos across diverse domains (e.g., natural landscapes,
sports, indoor scenes, science fiction, chemical and physical experiments) and
extract their event-level descriptions with inherent temporal causality, which
are then rewritten into text-to-video prompts by independent annotators. For
each prompt, we design a suite of binary evaluation questions from the
perspective of dynamic and static properties, with a total of ten carefully
defined evaluation dimensions. In total, our VideoVerse comprises 300 carefully
curated prompts, involving 815 events and 793 binary evaluation questions.
Consequently, a human preference aligned QA-based evaluation pipeline is
developed by using modern vision-language models. Finally, we perform a
systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source T2V
models on VideoVerse, providing in-depth analysis on how far the current T2V
generators are from world models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First scalable continuous-time consistency distillation for large-scale image/video diffusion models, addressing quality limitations with score-regularized approach that achieves high-fidelity generation in 1-4 steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scale continuous-time consistency models to large-scale text-to-image and video tasks, overcoming infrastructure challenges in JVP computation and addressing fundamental quality limitations in fine-detail generation.

Method: Developed parallelism-compatible FlashAttention-2 JVP kernel for training on 10B+ parameter models, and proposed score-regularized continuous-time consistency model (rCM) that incorporates score distillation as a long-skip regularizer to complement the mode-covering forward-divergence objective.

Result: rCM matches or surpasses state-of-the-art DMD2 on quality metrics while offering better diversity, generating high-fidelity samples in 1-4 steps (15-50x speedup) on models up to 14B parameters and 5-second videos, without GAN tuning or extensive hyperparameter searches.

Conclusion: rCM provides a practical and theoretically grounded framework for advancing large-scale diffusion distillation, achieving both high quality and diversity with significant acceleration.

Abstract: This work represents the first effort to scale up continuous-time consistency
distillation to general application-level image and video diffusion models.
Although continuous-time consistency model (sCM) is theoretically principled
and empirically powerful for accelerating academic-scale diffusion, its
applicability to large-scale text-to-image and video tasks remains unclear due
to infrastructure challenges in Jacobian-vector product (JVP) computation and
the limitations of standard evaluation benchmarks. We first develop a
parallelism-compatible FlashAttention-2 JVP kernel, enabling sCM training on
models with over 10 billion parameters and high-dimensional video tasks. Our
investigation reveals fundamental quality limitations of sCM in fine-detail
generation, which we attribute to error accumulation and the "mode-covering"
nature of its forward-divergence objective. To remedy this, we propose the
score-regularized continuous-time consistency model (rCM), which incorporates
score distillation as a long-skip regularizer. This integration complements sCM
with the "mode-seeking" reverse divergence, effectively improving visual
quality while maintaining high generation diversity. Validated on large-scale
models (Cosmos-Predict2, Wan2.1) up to 14B parameters and 5-second videos, rCM
matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art distillation method DMD2 on quality
metrics while offering notable advantages in diversity, all without GAN tuning
or extensive hyperparameter searches. The distilled models generate
high-fidelity samples in only $1\sim4$ steps, accelerating diffusion sampling
by $15\times\sim50\times$. These results position rCM as a practical and
theoretically grounded framework for advancing large-scale diffusion
distillation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gaze on the Prize introduces a learnable foveal attention mechanism for visual RL that uses return differences to guide attention toward task-relevant features, achieving 2.4x sample efficiency improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual RL agents waste resources on irrelevant pixels in high-dimensional image data, leading to inefficient and unstable learning. Human visual foveation inspired the need to focus attention on task-relevant features.

Method: Uses return-guided contrastive learning with a learnable foveal attention mechanism. Groups similar visual representations into positives/negatives based on return differences, constructs contrastive triplets to train attention to distinguish success/failure states.

Result: Achieves up to 2.4x improvement in sample efficiency, solves tasks that baseline fails to learn across ManiSkill3 manipulation tasks, without modifying underlying algorithm or hyperparameters.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses visual RL inefficiency by focusing attention on task-relevant features through return-guided contrastive learning, demonstrating significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Visual Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents must learn to act based on
high-dimensional image data where only a small fraction of the pixels is
task-relevant. This forces agents to waste exploration and computational
resources on irrelevant features, leading to sample-inefficient and unstable
learning. To address this, inspired by human visual foveation, we introduce
Gaze on the Prize. This framework augments visual RL with a learnable foveal
attention mechanism (Gaze), guided by a self-supervised signal derived from the
agent's experience pursuing higher returns (the Prize). Our key insight is that
return differences reveal what matters most: If two similar representations
produce different outcomes, their distinguishing features are likely
task-relevant, and the gaze should focus on them accordingly. This is realized
through return-guided contrastive learning that trains the attention to
distinguish between the features relevant to success and failure. We group
similar visual representations into positives and negatives based on their
return differences and use the resulting labels to construct contrastive
triplets. These triplets provide the training signal that teaches the attention
mechanism to produce distinguishable representations for states associated with
different outcomes. Our method achieves up to 2.4x improvement in sample
efficiency and can solve tasks that the baseline fails to learn, demonstrated
across a suite of manipulation tasks from the ManiSkill3 benchmark, all without
modifying the underlying algorithm or hyperparameters.

TL;DR: A modular framework for spatial image processing with grayscale quantization, color enhancement, sharpening, bidirectional transformation, and geometric feature extraction, achieving high accuracy in various image processing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a comprehensive and modular framework for spatial image processing that integrates multiple techniques for robust and deterministic performance in real-time image analysis and computer vision applications.

Method: Stepwise intensity transformation for grayscale quantization, histogram equalization in RGB and YCrCb color spaces, HSV value-channel manipulation for brightness adjustment, 3x3 convolution kernel for sharpening, bidirectional transformation pipeline with unsharp masking and gamma correction, and geometric feature extraction using Canny edge detection, Hough-based line estimation, Harris corner detection, and morphological window localization.

Result: Bidirectional transformation achieved 76.10% forward and 74.80% reverse accuracy, Hough-based line estimation achieved 51.50° for billiard cue alignment, and cue isolation yielded 81.87% similarity against ground truth images.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates robust and deterministic performance across diverse datasets, highlighting its potential for real-time image analysis and computer vision applications.

Abstract: This study introduces a modular framework for spatial image processing,
integrating grayscale quantization, color and brightness enhancement, image
sharpening, bidirectional transformation pipelines, and geometric feature
extraction. A stepwise intensity transformation quantizes grayscale images into
eight discrete levels, producing a posterization effect that simplifies
representation while preserving structural detail. Color enhancement is
achieved via histogram equalization in both RGB and YCrCb color spaces, with
the latter improving contrast while maintaining chrominance fidelity.
Brightness adjustment is implemented through HSV value-channel manipulation,
and image sharpening is performed using a 3 * 3 convolution kernel to enhance
high-frequency details. A bidirectional transformation pipeline that integrates
unsharp masking, gamma correction, and noise amplification achieved accuracy
levels of 76.10% and 74.80% for the forward and reverse processes,
respectively. Geometric feature extraction employed Canny edge detection,
Hough-based line estimation (e.g., 51.50{\deg} for billiard cue alignment),
Harris corner detection, and morphological window localization. Cue isolation
further yielded 81.87\% similarity against ground truth images. Experimental
evaluation across diverse datasets demonstrates robust and deterministic
performance, highlighting its potential for real-time image analysis and
computer vision.

*Zhenlong Yuan,Xiangyan Qu,Chengxuan Qian,Rui Chen,Jing Tang,Lei Sun,Xiangxiang Chu,Dapeng Zhang,Yiwei Wang,Yujun Cai,Shuo Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-STAR is a framework for open-vocabulary action recognition that decomposes actions into discriminative sub-motions and uses tool-augmented reinforcement learning to reduce cross-modal hallucination and improve fine-grained action recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal large language models rely too heavily on text-centric priors, limiting their ability to distinguish semantically similar actions in open-vocabulary scenarios.

Method: The approach decomposes actions into discriminative sub-motions for fine-grained matching and dynamically invokes domain-specific tools for cross-modal interleaving. It uses a hierarchical reward system that balances tool-usage efficiency, sub-motion relevance, and structural coherence.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on HMDB-51, UCF-101, SSv2, Kinetics-400, and Kinetics-600 datasets, with superior ability to distinguish fine-grained actions and handle cross-modal hallucination.

Conclusion: Video-STAR successfully enables category-specific reasoning capacity and reduces cross-modal hallucination by transitioning from text-centric reasoning to visually grounded inference through autonomous tool usage and sub-motion pattern prioritization.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
potential in bridging visual and textual reasoning, yet their reliance on
text-centric priors often limits their ability to disentangle semantically
similar actions in open-vocabulary scenarios. To address this, we propose
Video-STAR, a framework that harmonizes contextual sub-motion decomposition
with tool-augmented reinforcement learning for open-vocabulary action
recognition (OVAR). Unlike prior methods that treat actions as monolithic
entities, our approach innovatively decomposes actions into discriminative
sub-motions for fine-grained matching while dynamically invoking
domain-specific tools for cross-modal interleaving, thereby enabling
category-specific reasoning capacity and reducing cross-modal hallucination.
Moreover, by designing a hierarchical reward that balances tool-usage
efficiency, sub-motion relevance, and structural coherence in reasoning, our
method autonomously leverages external tools to prioritize sub-motion patterns
without explicit supervision, transmitting from text-centric reasoning to
visually grounded inference. Extensive evaluations on HMDB-51, UCF-101, SSv2,
Kinetics-400, and Kinetics-600 datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods in distinguishing fine-grained
actions and handling cross-modal hallucination, validating our excellent
robustness and generalization.

*Onur Keleş,Aslı Özyürek,Gerardo Ortega,Kadir Gökgö,Esam Ghaleb*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Visual Iconicity Challenge benchmark to evaluate vision-language models on sign language iconicity tasks, finding that current VLMs perform below human baselines but show promising correlations between phonological form prediction and human iconicity judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test visual grounding in VLMs using sign language iconicity as a natural testbed, since iconicity involves visual form-meaning mappings that are essential for understanding human communication.

Method: Created a video-based benchmark with three tasks: phonological sign-form prediction, transparency (meaning inference), and graded iconicity ratings. Evaluated 13 state-of-the-art VLMs on Sign Language of the Netherlands in zero- and few-shot settings, comparing to human baselines.

Result: VLMs recover some handshape and location details but remain below human performance on phonological form prediction; perform far from human baselines on transparency; only top models correlate moderately with human iconicity ratings. Models with better phonological form prediction correlate better with human iconicity judgment.

Conclusion: The benchmark validates diagnostic tasks for visual grounding and suggests that human-centric signals and embodied learning methods are needed to improve iconicity modeling and visual grounding in multimodal models.

Abstract: Iconicity, the resemblance between linguistic form and meaning, is pervasive
in signed languages, offering a natural testbed for visual grounding. For
vision-language models (VLMs), the challenge is to recover such essential
mappings from dynamic human motion rather than static context. We introduce the
\textit{Visual Iconicity Challenge}, a novel video-based benchmark that adapts
psycholinguistic measures to evaluate VLMs on three tasks: (i) phonological
sign-form prediction (e.g., handshape, location), (ii) transparency (inferring
meaning from visual form), and (iii) graded iconicity ratings. We assess $13$
state-of-the-art VLMs in zero- and few-shot settings on Sign Language of the
Netherlands and compare them to human baselines. On \textit{phonological form
prediction}, VLMs recover some handshape and location detail but remain below
human performance; on \textit{transparency}, they are far from human baselines;
and only top models correlate moderately with human \textit{iconicity ratings}.
Interestingly, \textit{models with stronger phonological form prediction
correlate better with human iconicity judgment}, indicating shared sensitivity
to visually grounded structure. Our findings validate these diagnostic tasks
and motivate human-centric signals and embodied learning methods for modelling
iconicity and improving visual grounding in multimodal models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of in-depth analysis of MLLM design choices and the challenge of integrating MLLMs with diffusion models for difficult tasks like video editing.

Method: Comprehensive study on integrating MLLMs and diffusion models, analyzing cooperation between images and videos in unified modeling, using modality-specific MLLM features to unify image and video editing tasks.

Result: Training on image data leads to emergent video editing capabilities without explicit supervision, and the method handles broad range of image/video editing tasks with state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The framework effectively unifies image and video editing within a single model, overcoming video data scarcity through emergent capabilities from image training.

Abstract: With recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) showing
strong visual understanding and reasoning, interest is growing in using them to
improve the editing performance of diffusion models. Despite rapid progress,
most studies lack an in-depth analysis of MLLM design choices. Moreover, the
integration of MLLMs and diffusion models remains an open challenge in some
difficult tasks, such as video editing. In this paper, we present InstructX, a
unified framework for image and video editing. Specifically, we conduct a
comprehensive study on integrating MLLMs and diffusion models for
instruction-driven editing across diverse tasks. Building on this study, we
analyze the cooperation and distinction between images and videos in unified
modeling. (1) We show that training on image data can lead to emergent video
editing capabilities without explicit supervision, thereby alleviating the
constraints imposed by scarce video training data. (2) By incorporating
modality-specific MLLM features, our approach effectively unifies image and
video editing tasks within a single model. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method can handle a broad range of image and video editing tasks and
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address diagnostic challenges in emergency medicine where timely interpretation of medical images is crucial for patient outcomes in traumatic brain injuries.

Method: Integrates AC-BiFPN with Transformer architecture to extract multi-scale features from CT/MRI scans and generate coherent diagnostic reports by modeling long-range dependencies.

Result: Outperforms traditional CNN-based models on RSNA Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection dataset in both diagnostic accuracy and report generation quality.

Conclusion: Combining advanced feature extraction with transformer-based text generation improves clinical decision-making for traumatic brain injury diagnosis and serves as educational tool for trainees.

Abstract: Traumatic brain injuries present significant diagnostic challenges in
emergency medicine, where the timely interpretation of medical images is
crucial for patient outcomes. In this paper, we propose a novel AI-based
approach for automatic radiology report generation tailored to cranial trauma
cases. Our model integrates an AC-BiFPN with a Transformer architecture to
capture and process complex medical imaging data such as CT and MRI scans. The
AC-BiFPN extracts multi-scale features, enabling the detection of intricate
anomalies like intracranial hemorrhages, while the Transformer generates
coherent, contextually relevant diagnostic reports by modeling long-range
dependencies. We evaluate the performance of our model on the RSNA Intracranial
Hemorrhage Detection dataset, where it outperforms traditional CNN-based models
in both diagnostic accuracy and report generation. This solution not only
supports radiologists in high-pressure environments but also provides a
powerful educational tool for trainee physicians, offering real-time feedback
and enhancing their learning experience. Our findings demonstrate the potential
of combining advanced feature extraction with transformer-based text generation
to improve clinical decision-making in the diagnosis of traumatic brain
injuries.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoA-VR is a Mixture-of-Agents Video Restoration system that uses three coordinated agents (Degradation Identification, Routing/Restoration, and Quality Assessment) to handle complex video degradations, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world videos suffer from complex degradations (noise, compression artifacts, low-light) that existing restoration methods struggle with, requiring manual model selection or using monolithic architectures that don't generalize well.

Method: Three-agent system: 1) VLM-based degradation identifier using a new benchmark, 2) LLM-powered self-adaptive router that learns restoration strategies, 3) VLM-based video quality assessment model using a new Res-VQ dataset.

Result: Extensive experiments show MoA-VR effectively handles diverse and compound degradations, consistently outperforming existing baselines in both objective metrics and perceptual quality.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates the potential of integrating multimodal intelligence and modular reasoning for general-purpose video restoration.

Abstract: Real-world videos often suffer from complex degradations, such as noise,
compression artifacts, and low-light distortions, due to diverse acquisition
and transmission conditions. Existing restoration methods typically require
professional manual selection of specialized models or rely on monolithic
architectures that fail to generalize across varying degradations. Inspired by
expert experience, we propose MoA-VR, the first
\underline{M}ixture-\underline{o}f-\underline{A}gents \underline{V}ideo
\underline{R}estoration system that mimics the reasoning and processing
procedures of human professionals through three coordinated agents: Degradation
Identification, Routing and Restoration, and Restoration Quality Assessment.
Specifically, we construct a large-scale and high-resolution video degradation
recognition benchmark and build a vision-language model (VLM) driven
degradation identifier. We further introduce a self-adaptive router powered by
large language models (LLMs), which autonomously learns effective restoration
strategies by observing tool usage patterns. To assess intermediate and final
processed video quality, we construct the \underline{Res}tored
\underline{V}ideo \underline{Q}uality (Res-VQ) dataset and design a dedicated
VLM-based video quality assessment (VQA) model tailored for restoration tasks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoA-VR effectively handles diverse and
compound degradations, consistently outperforming existing baselines in terms
of both objective metrics and perceptual quality. These results highlight the
potential of integrating multimodal intelligence and modular reasoning in
general-purpose video restoration systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies ViT attention sinks - high-norm visual tokens from Vision Transformers that contain important semantic information but are often overlooked in Large Vision Language Models. By explicitly utilizing these tokens, the authors demonstrate improved visual reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs focus on attention sinks within LLMs, but neglect important high-norm visual tokens from ViT that contain crucial semantic information for visual understanding and reasoning.

Method: The authors identify ViT attention sinks (high-norm visual tokens), analyze their information content through qualitative and quantitative methods, and propose both training-free and training-based approaches to better leverage these tokens in LVLMs.

Result: Explicit utilization of ViT attention sinks leads to substantial improvements across various LVLMs and visual reasoning tasks, demonstrating their untapped potential for enhancing visual reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: ViT attention sinks contain valuable high-level semantic information that significantly contributes to visual understanding and reasoning in LVLMs, and properly leveraging them can substantially improve model performance.

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have recently emerged as powerful
architectures capable of understanding and reasoning over both visual and
textual information. These models typically rely on two key components: a
Vision Transformer (ViT) and a Large Language Model (LLM). ViT encodes visual
content into a sequence of image tokens and serves as the perceptual front-end
-- the eyes of the model. In contrast, the LLM interprets these tokens to
perform high-level reasoning, generates responses, and functions as the
cognitive core -- the brain of the model. However, it remains unclear which
visual tokens contribute most significantly to understanding and reasoning, and
how effectively these signals are propagated from ViT to the LLM. While most
existing works have focused on identifying attention sinks, low-semantic tokens
receiving disproportionately high attention, within the LLM, we shift the focus
to the vision encoder by identifying a class of high-norm visual tokens from
ViT, referred to as ViT attention sinks -- a problem that has been rarely
studied but is indeed very important for LVLMs. Our findings show that these
ViT sinks encapsulate high-level semantic concepts from images, allowing the
LLM to perform more effective understanding and reasoning. Despite their
importance, these sink tokens are often overlooked in existing LVLM
architectures. To explore their contribution, we present both qualitative and
quantitative analyses of the information embedded in these sink tokens. We also
propose both training-free and training-based approaches to better leverage how
this information is interpreted by the LLM, and to what extent. By explicitly
utilizing these tokens, we demonstrate substantial improvements across a range
of LVLMs and visual reasoning tasks, highlighting the untapped potential of ViT
attention sinks in enhancing visual reasoning.

TL;DR: A deep compression framework using semantic scene graphs achieves 98% data reduction for 3D point clouds while maintaining structural and semantic fidelity, supporting downstream robotics applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient transmission of large 3D point cloud data is critical for multi-agent robotic systems under bandwidth constraints and intermittent connectivity, which often degrade system performance.

Method: Decomposes point clouds into semantically coherent patches, encodes them into compact latent representations using semantic-aware encoders with FiLM conditioning, and reconstructs using a folding-based decoder guided by latent features and graph node attributes.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art compression rates, reducing data size by up to 98% while preserving structural and semantic fidelity on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets. Supports downstream applications with comparable performance to raw LiDAR scans.

Conclusion: The proposed semantic scene graph-based compression framework enables efficient point cloud transmission for multi-agent robotic systems while maintaining high reconstruction quality and supporting critical downstream applications.

Abstract: Efficient transmission of 3D point cloud data is critical for advanced
perception in centralized and decentralized multi-agent robotic systems,
especially nowadays with the growing reliance on edge and cloud-based
processing. However, the large and complex nature of point clouds creates
challenges under bandwidth constraints and intermittent connectivity, often
degrading system performance. We propose a deep compression framework based on
semantic scene graphs. The method decomposes point clouds into semantically
coherent patches and encodes them into compact latent representations with
semantic-aware encoders conditioned by Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). A
folding-based decoder, guided by latent features and graph node attributes,
enables structurally accurate reconstruction. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI
and nuScenes datasets show that the framework achieves state-of-the-art
compression rates, reducing data size by up to 98% while preserving both
structural and semantic fidelity. In addition, it supports downstream
applications such as multi-robot pose graph optimization and map merging,
achieving trajectory accuracy and map alignment comparable to those obtained
with raw LiDAR scans.

TL;DR: Fine-tuning small random subnetworks (slices) in pre-trained models works well due to spectral balance and high task energy, leading to the Universal Winning Slice Hypothesis. SliceFine method updates only selected slices without adding parameters, matching SOTA PEFT performance with better efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a theoretical foundation for why parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) works by explaining why fine-tuning small subnetworks within pre-trained models is sufficient for downstream adaptation.

Method: Proposed SliceFine - a PEFT method that updates only selected slices of original weights without introducing new parameters, exploiting inherent redundancy in pre-trained models based on spectral balance and task energy properties.

Result: SliceFine matches state-of-the-art PEFT methods across language and vision tasks while significantly improving training speed, memory efficiency, and model compactness.

Conclusion: The work bridges theory and practice by providing a theoretically grounded alternative to existing PEFT techniques through the Universal Winning Slice Hypothesis and SliceFine method.

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical framework explaining why fine tuning small,
randomly selected subnetworks (slices) within pre trained models can be
sufficient for downstream adaptation. We prove that pretrained networks exhibit
a universal winning slice property arising from two phenomena: (1) spectral
balance the eigenspectra of different weight matrix slices are remarkably
similar; and (2) high task energy their backbone representations retain rich,
task relevant features. This leads to the Universal Winning Slice Hypothesis,
which provides a theoretical foundation for parameter efficient fine tuning
(PEFT) in large scale models. Inspired by this, we propose SliceFine, a PEFT
method that exploits this inherent redundancy by updating only selected slices
of the original weights introducing zero new parameters, unlike adapter-based
approaches. Empirically, SliceFine matches the performance of state of the art
PEFT methods across language and vision tasks, while significantly improving
training speed, memory efficiency, and model compactness. Our work bridges
theory and practice, offering a theoretically grounded alternative to existing
PEFT techniques.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable flexible and robust trajectory control in video generation that supports both dense and sparse trajectory manipulation while maintaining efficiency and controllability.

Method: Uses unified point-based motion representation with segmentation ID, trajectory ID, and optional color channel. Employs efficient sequence-concatenation scheme instead of token concatenation or ControlNet. Adopts annealing training strategy to reduce reliance on complete supervision.

Result: Achieves faster convergence, stronger controllability, and more efficient inference while maintaining robustness under unaligned conditions. Supports multi-granularity trajectory control for various applications.

Conclusion: FlexTraj enables alignment-agnostic trajectory control for diverse video generation tasks including motion cloning, drag-based editing, motion interpolation, camera redirection, and mesh animations.

Abstract: We present FlexTraj, a framework for image-to-video generation with flexible
point trajectory control. FlexTraj introduces a unified point-based motion
representation that encodes each point with a segmentation ID, a temporally
consistent trajectory ID, and an optional color channel for appearance cues,
enabling both dense and sparse trajectory control. Instead of injecting
trajectory conditions into the video generator through token concatenation or
ControlNet, FlexTraj employs an efficient sequence-concatenation scheme that
achieves faster convergence, stronger controllability, and more efficient
inference, while maintaining robustness under unaligned conditions. To train
such a unified point trajectory-controlled video generator, FlexTraj adopts an
annealing training strategy that gradually reduces reliance on complete
supervision and aligned condition. Experimental results demonstrate that
FlexTraj enables multi-granularity, alignment-agnostic trajectory control for
video generation, supporting various applications such as motion cloning,
drag-based image-to-video, motion interpolation, camera redirection, flexible

TL;DR: SpatialLadder is a progressive training framework that builds spatial intelligence in VLMs through three stages: spatial perception, understanding, and complex reasoning, achieving SOTA performance on spatial reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with spatial reasoning due to learning it directly without establishing hierarchical foundations of perception and understanding first.

Method: Three-stage progressive training: (1) spatial perception via object localization, (2) spatial understanding through multi-dimensional tasks, (3) complex reasoning with RL and verifiable rewards, using SpatialLadder-26k dataset.

Result: SpatialLadder (3B parameters) achieves 23.4% average improvement over base model, surpasses GPT-4o by 20.8% and Gemini-2.0-Flash by 10.1%, with 7.2% improvement on out-of-domain benchmarks.

Conclusion: Progressive training from perception to reasoning is essential for robust spatial intelligence in VLMs, enabling strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning remains a fundamental challenge for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), with current approaches struggling to achieve robust performance
despite recent advances. We identify that this limitation stems from a critical
gap: existing methods attempt to learn spatial reasoning directly without
establishing the hierarchical foundations of perception and understanding. To
address this challenge, we present a comprehensive methodology for building
spatial intelligence progressively. We introduce SpatialLadder-26k, a
multimodal dataset containing 26,610 samples spanning object localization,
single image, multi-view, and video spatial reasoning tasks, constructed
through a standardized pipeline that ensures systematic coverage across
modalities. Building on this dataset, we design a three-stage progressive
training framework that (1) establishes spatial perception through object
localization, (2) develops spatial understanding through multi-dimensional
spatial tasks, and (3) strengthens complex reasoning via reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards. This approach yields SpatialLadder, a 3B-parameter
model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning
benchmarks, with 23.4% average improvement over the base model, surpassing
GPT-4o by 20.8% and Gemini-2.0-Flash by 10.1%. Notably, SpatialLadder maintains
strong generalization with 7.2% improvement on out-of-domain benchmarks,
demonstrating that progressive training from perception to reasoning is
essential for robust spatial intelligence.

TL;DR: Kontinuous Kontext is an instruction-driven image editing model that adds fine-grained control over edit strength through a scalar input, enabling smooth transitions from no change to full edit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing instruction-based image editing methods lack fine-grained control over edit extent, limiting users' ability to make subtle or gradual adjustments.

Method: Extends state-of-the-art image editing model with a lightweight projector network that maps scalar edit strength and instruction to modulation coefficients, trained on synthesized quadruplet dataset.

Result: Enables continuous control over edit strength for diverse operations (stylization, attributes, materials, background, shape changes) without attribute-specific training.

Conclusion: Provides unified fine-grained control over edit strength in instruction-driven image editing, allowing smooth transitions from subtle to strong edits.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing offers a powerful and intuitive way to
manipulate images through natural language. Yet, relying solely on text
instructions limits fine-grained control over the extent of edits. We introduce
Kontinuous Kontext, an instruction-driven editing model that provides a new
dimension of control over edit strength, enabling users to adjust edits
gradually from no change to a fully realized result in a smooth and continuous
manner. Kontinuous Kontext extends a state-of-the-art image editing model to
accept an additional input, a scalar edit strength which is then paired with
the edit instruction, enabling explicit control over the extent of the edit. To
inject this scalar information, we train a lightweight projector network that
maps the input scalar and the edit instruction to coefficients in the model's
modulation space. For training our model, we synthesize a diverse dataset of
image-edit-instruction-strength quadruplets using existing generative models,
followed by a filtering stage to ensure quality and consistency. Kontinuous
Kontext provides a unified approach for fine-grained control over edit strength
for instruction driven editing from subtle to strong across diverse operations
such as stylization, attribute, material, background, and shape changes,
without requiring attribute-specific training.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the limitation of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in long-chain reflective reasoning by creating a benchmark (MM-HELIX), generating training data (MM-HELIX-100K), and proposing a novel training strategy (AHPO) that significantly improves reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs show proficiency in basic reasoning tasks but lack capability for long-chain reflective reasoning required for complex real-world problems, which remains underexplored.

Method: Created MM-HELIX benchmark with 1,260 samples of 42 challenging tasks requiring iterative thinking. Developed Step-Elicited Response Generation pipeline to create MM-HELIX-100K dataset. Proposed Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization (AHPO) that dynamically combines offline supervision and online optimization in a single stage.

Result: Applied to Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline, achieved +18.6% accuracy improvement on MM-HELIX benchmark and +5.7% average performance gain on general mathematical and logic tasks, demonstrating strong generalization.

Conclusion: Reflective reasoning in MLLMs can be effectively learned and generalized, paving the way for developing more capable multimodal models.

Abstract: While current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
proficiency in reasoning tasks such as mathematics and logic, their capacity
for long-chain reflective reasoning, a prerequisite for solving complex
real-world problems, remains largely underexplored. In this work, we first
conduct an extensive empirical investigation to evaluate this capability.
Leveraging a carefully designed data synthesis engine, we construct MM-HELIX, a
multimodal benchmark consisting 1,260 samples of 42 challenging synthetic tasks
that require iterative thinking and backtracking. Empirical results on this
benchmark reveal that existing MLLMs exhibit significant performance deficits
in long-chain reflective reasoning. To address this limitation, we generate
post-training data and further explore learning paradigms for exploiting such
data. We first develop the Step-Elicited Response Generation pipeline to create
MM-HELIX-100K, a large-scale dataset of 100k high-quality, reflective reasoning
traces for instruction-tuning stage. Given that standard Reinforcement Learning
fails on complex tasks due to sparse reward signals and catastrophic forgetting
after Supervised Fine-Tuning, we propose Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization
(AHPO), a novel training strategy that dynamically unifies offline supervision
and online optimization into a single stage. This strategy enables the model to
learn from expert data when rewards are sparse and conduct independent
exploration once proficient. When applied to the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline, our
method achieves a +18.6\% accuracy improvement on MM-HELIX benchmark and
demonstrates strong generalization with a +5.7\% average performance gain on
general mathematic and logic tasks. Our work demonstrate that reflective
reasoning in MLLMs can be effectively learned and generalized, paving the way
for developing more capable MLLMs.

TL;DR: VideoNorms is a benchmark for assessing cultural awareness in VideoLLMs, containing 1000+ video-norm pairs from US and Chinese cultures with annotations based on speech act theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As VideoLLMs are deployed globally, they need cultural understanding and grounding. Current benchmarks are inadequate for assessing cultural awareness.

Method: Human-AI collaboration framework where a teacher model provides candidate annotations and human experts validate/correct them. Dataset includes norm adherence/violation labels and verbal/non-verbal evidence.

Result: Models perform worse on norm violations than adherence, worse on Chinese culture vs US, struggle with non-verbal evidence, and perform worse in formal contexts unlike humans.

Conclusion: There is a critical need for culturally-grounded video language model training, which this benchmark and framework begin to address.

Abstract: As Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) are deployed globally, they
require understanding of and grounding in the relevant cultural background. To
properly assess these models' cultural awareness, adequate benchmarks are
needed. We introduce VideoNorms, a benchmark of over 1000 (video clip, norm)
pairs from US and Chinese cultures annotated with socio-cultural norms grounded
in speech act theory, norm adherence and violations labels, and verbal and
non-verbal evidence. To build VideoNorms, we use a human-AI collaboration
framework, where a teacher model using theoretically-grounded prompting
provides candidate annotations and a set of trained human experts validate and
correct the annotations. We benchmark a variety of open-weight VideoLLMs on the
new dataset which highlight several common trends: 1) models performs worse on
norm violation than adherence; 2) models perform worse w.r.t Chinese culture
compared to the US culture; 3) models have more difficulty in providing
non-verbal evidence compared to verbal for the norm adhere/violation label and
struggle to identify the exact norm corresponding to a speech-act; and 4)
unlike humans, models perform worse in formal, non-humorous contexts. Our
findings emphasize the need for culturally-grounded video language model

TL;DR: ARTDECO is a unified framework for real-time 3D reconstruction that combines feed-forward efficiency with SLAM reliability using 3D foundation models and hierarchical Gaussian representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods face a tradeoff between per-scene optimization (high fidelity but slow) and feed-forward models (fast but inaccurate). ARTDECO aims to bridge this gap for real-time applications like AR/VR and robotics.

Method: Uses 3D foundation models for pose estimation and point prediction, coupled with a Gaussian decoder that transforms multi-scale features into structured 3D Gaussians. Features hierarchical Gaussian representation with LoD-aware rendering.

Result: Experiments on eight benchmarks show interactive performance comparable to SLAM, robustness similar to feed-forward systems, and reconstruction quality close to per-scene optimization.

Conclusion: ARTDECO provides a practical path toward on-the-fly digitization of real-world environments with both accurate geometry and high visual fidelity.

Abstract: On-the-fly 3D reconstruction from monocular image sequences is a
long-standing challenge in computer vision, critical for applications such as
real-to-sim, AR/VR, and robotics. Existing methods face a major tradeoff:
per-scene optimization yields high fidelity but is computationally expensive,
whereas feed-forward foundation models enable real-time inference but struggle
with accuracy and robustness. In this work, we propose ARTDECO, a unified
framework that combines the efficiency of feed-forward models with the
reliability of SLAM-based pipelines. ARTDECO uses 3D foundation models for pose
estimation and point prediction, coupled with a Gaussian decoder that
transforms multi-scale features into structured 3D Gaussians. To sustain both
fidelity and efficiency at scale, we design a hierarchical Gaussian
representation with a LoD-aware rendering strategy, which improves rendering
fidelity while reducing redundancy. Experiments on eight diverse indoor and
outdoor benchmarks show that ARTDECO delivers interactive performance
comparable to SLAM, robustness similar to feed-forward systems, and
reconstruction quality close to per-scene optimization, providing a practical
path toward on-the-fly digitization of real-world environments with both
accurate geometry and high visual fidelity. Explore more demos on our project

*Yunzhe Xu,Yiyuan Pan,Zhe Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Memoir introduces an imagination-guided memory retrieval system for vision-and-language navigation that uses a world model to generate future state queries for selective retrieval of both environmental observations and behavioral patterns, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory-persistent VLN approaches lack effective memory access mechanisms and predominantly store only environmental observations while neglecting valuable navigation behavioral patterns that encode decision-making strategies.

Method: 1) Language-conditioned world model that imagines future states for encoding experiences and generating retrieval queries; 2) Hybrid Viewpoint-Level Memory storing both observations and behavioral patterns; 3) Experience-augmented navigation model with specialized encoders for retrieved knowledge integration.

Result: Significant improvements across all 10 testing scenarios, with 5.4% SPL gains on IR2R over best baseline, 8.3x training speedup, and 74% inference memory reduction. Substantial headroom indicated (73.3% vs 93.4% upper bound).

Conclusion: Predictive retrieval of both environmental and behavioral memories enables more effective navigation, validating the imagination-guided paradigm for memory-persistent VLN.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to follow natural
language instructions through environments, with memory-persistent variants
demanding progressive improvement through accumulated experience. Existing
approaches for memory-persistent VLN face critical limitations: they lack
effective memory access mechanisms, instead relying on entire memory
incorporation or fixed-horizon lookup, and predominantly store only
environmental observations while neglecting navigation behavioral patterns that
encode valuable decision-making strategies. We present Memoir, which employs
imagination as a retrieval mechanism grounded by explicit memory: a world model
imagines future navigation states as queries to selectively retrieve relevant
environmental observations and behavioral histories. The approach comprises: 1)
a language-conditioned world model that imagines future states serving dual
purposes: encoding experiences for storage and generating retrieval queries; 2)
Hybrid Viewpoint-Level Memory that anchors both observations and behavioral
patterns to viewpoints, enabling hybrid retrieval; and 3) an
experience-augmented navigation model that integrates retrieved knowledge
through specialized encoders. Extensive evaluation across diverse
memory-persistent VLN benchmarks with 10 distinctive testing scenarios
demonstrates Memoir's effectiveness: significant improvements across all
scenarios, with 5.4% SPL gains on IR2R over the best memory-persistent
baseline, accompanied by 8.3x training speedup and 74% inference memory
reduction. The results validate that predictive retrieval of both environmental
and behavioral memories enables more effective navigation, with analysis
indicating substantial headroom (73.3% vs 93.4% upper bound) for this
imagination-guided paradigm. Code at https://github.com/xyz9911/Memoir.

### [97] [VideoCanvas: Unified Video Completion from Arbitrary Spatiotemporal Patches via In-Context Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08555)
*Minghong Cai,Qiulin Wang,Zongli Ye,Wenze Liu,Quande Liu,Weicai Ye,Xintao Wang,Pengfei Wan,Kun Gai,Xiangyu Yue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoCanvas enables arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion by allowing users to place patches anywhere in space and time, unifying various video generation tasks into a single framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a flexible video generation system that can handle arbitrary user-specified patches at any spatial location and timestamp, unifying existing controllable video generation tasks under one paradigm.

Method: Uses a hybrid conditioning strategy with zero-padding for spatial control and Temporal RoPE Interpolation for temporal alignment, adapting In-Context Conditioning without adding new parameters to resolve temporal ambiguity in latent video diffusion models.

Result: VideoCanvas significantly outperforms existing conditioning paradigms and establishes state-of-the-art performance in flexible video generation, as demonstrated on the new VideoCanvasBench benchmark.

Conclusion: VideoCanvas successfully enables pixel-frame-aware control on frozen backbones, resolving fundamental temporal ambiguity issues and providing a unified solution for arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion tasks.

Abstract: We introduce the task of arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, where a
video is generated from arbitrary, user-specified patches placed at any spatial
location and timestamp, akin to painting on a video canvas. This flexible
formulation naturally unifies many existing controllable video generation
tasks--including first-frame image-to-video, inpainting, extension, and
interpolation--under a single, cohesive paradigm. Realizing this vision,
however, faces a fundamental obstacle in modern latent video diffusion models:
the temporal ambiguity introduced by causal VAEs, where multiple pixel frames
are compressed into a single latent representation, making precise frame-level
conditioning structurally difficult. We address this challenge with
VideoCanvas, a novel framework that adapts the In-Context Conditioning (ICC)
paradigm to this fine-grained control task with zero new parameters. We propose
a hybrid conditioning strategy that decouples spatial and temporal control:
spatial placement is handled via zero-padding, while temporal alignment is
achieved through Temporal RoPE Interpolation, which assigns each condition a
continuous fractional position within the latent sequence. This resolves the
VAE's temporal ambiguity and enables pixel-frame-aware control on a frozen
backbone. To evaluate this new capability, we develop VideoCanvasBench, the
first benchmark for arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, covering both
intra-scene fidelity and inter-scene creativity. Experiments demonstrate that
VideoCanvas significantly outperforms existing conditioning paradigms,
establishing a new state of the art in flexible and unified video generation.

Conclusion: SciVideoBench provides valuable insights for future LMM development and aims to drive the evolution of truly capable multimodal AI co-scientists for scientific applications.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress across
various capabilities; however, complex video reasoning in the scientific domain
remains a significant and challenging frontier. Current video benchmarks
predominantly target general scenarios where perception/recognition is heavily
relied on, while with relatively simple reasoning tasks, leading to saturation
and thus failing to effectively evaluate advanced multimodal cognitive skills.
To address this critical gap, we introduce SciVideoBench, a rigorous benchmark
specifically designed to assess advanced video reasoning in scientific
contexts. SciVideoBench consists of 1,000 carefully crafted multiple-choice
questions derived from cutting-edge scientific experimental videos spanning
over 25 specialized academic subjects and verified by a semi-automatic system.
Each question demands sophisticated domain-specific knowledge, precise
spatiotemporal perception, and intricate logical reasoning, effectively
challenging models' higher-order cognitive abilities. Our evaluation highlights
significant performance deficits in state-of-the-art proprietary and
open-source LMMs, including Gemini 2.5 Pro and Qwen2.5-VL, indicating
substantial room for advancement in video reasoning capabilities. Detailed
analyses of critical factors such as reasoning complexity and visual grounding
provide valuable insights and clear direction for future developments in LMMs,
driving the evolution of truly capable multimodal AI co-scientists. We hope

*Maham Tanveer,Yang Zhou,Simon Niklaus,Ali Mahdavi Amiri,Hao Zhang,Krishna Kumar Singh,Nanxuan Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: \modelname{} is a video inbetweening framework that enables multi-modal controls (depth transition, motion trajectories, text prompts, etc.) for flexible and precise video interpolation using Diffusion Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video inbetweening methods cannot generate large/complex motions, accommodate user intents, or provide fine control over intermediate frames, limiting creative alignment.

Method: Uses Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture with motion controls mapped to sparse point-based representation. Separates content and motion controls into two branches with stage-wise training for multi-modal control learning.

Result: Enables dynamic, customizable, and contextually accurate visual narratives through multi-modal controls, as demonstrated by extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments.

Conclusion: The framework successfully balances flexibility, ease of use, and precision for fine-grained video interpolation through its multi-modal control approach.

Abstract: Video inbetweening creates smooth and natural transitions between two image
frames, making it an indispensable tool for video editing and long-form video
synthesis. Existing works in this domain are unable to generate large, complex,
or intricate motions. In particular, they cannot accommodate the versatility of
user intents and generally lack fine control over the details of intermediate
frames, leading to misalignment with the creative mind. To fill these gaps, we
introduce \modelname{}, a video inbetweening framework that allows multi-modal
controls, including depth transition and layering, motion trajectories, text
prompts, and target regions for movement localization, while achieving a
balance between flexibility, ease of use, and precision for fine-grained video
interpolation. To achieve this, we adopt the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)
architecture as our video generative model, due to its proven capability to
generate high-quality long videos. To ensure compatibility between DiT and our
multi-modal controls, we map all motion controls into a common sparse and
user-friendly point-based representation as the video/noise input. Further, to
respect the variety of controls which operate at varying levels of granularity
and influence, we separate content controls and motion controls into two
branches to encode the required features before guiding the denoising process,
resulting in two generators, one for motion and the other for content. Finally,
we propose a stage-wise training strategy to ensure that our model learns the
multi-modal controls smoothly. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate that multi-modal controls enable a more dynamic,
customizable, and contextually accurate visual narrative.

*Zhiyu Zheng,Shaoyu Chen,Haoran Yin,Xinbang Zhang,Jialv Zou,Xinggang Wang,Qian Zhang,Lefei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ResAD addresses spatio-temporal imbalance in end-to-end autonomous driving by predicting residual deviations from inertial references instead of direct trajectories, using point-wise normalization to balance optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current E2EAD systems suffer from spatio-temporal data imbalance that causes models to learn spurious correlations and prioritize uncertain distant predictions over immediate safety.

Method: Proposes ResAD framework with normalized residual trajectory modeling - predicts residual deviations from deterministic inertial references and uses point-wise normalization to re-weight optimization objectives.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art PDMS of 88.6 on NAVSIM benchmark using vanilla diffusion policy with only two denoising steps, demonstrating significant performance improvement.

Conclusion: ResAD effectively addresses trajectory data imbalance, simplifies learning task, and improves autonomous driving performance by focusing on causal factors necessitating deviations from default paths.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD) systems, which learn to predict future
trajectories directly from sensor data, are fundamentally challenged by the
inherent spatio-temporal imbalance of trajectory data. This imbalance creates a
significant optimization burden, causing models to learn spurious correlations
instead of causal inference, while also prioritizing uncertain, distant
predictions, thereby compromising immediate safety. To address these issues, we
propose ResAD, a novel Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling framework.
Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, our approach reframes the
learning task to predict the residual deviation from a deterministic inertial
reference. The inertial reference serves as a counterfactual, forcing the model
to move beyond simple pattern recognition and instead identify the underlying
causal factors (e.g., traffic rules, obstacles) that necessitate deviations
from a default, inertially-guided path. To deal with the optimization imbalance
caused by uncertain, long-term horizons, ResAD further incorporates Point-wise
Normalization of the predicted residual. It re-weights the optimization
objective, preventing large-magnitude errors associated with distant, uncertain
waypoints from dominating the learning signal. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of our framework. On the NAVSIM benchmark, ResAD achieves a
state-of-the-art PDMS of 88.6 using a vanilla diffusion policy with only two
denoising steps, demonstrating that our approach significantly simplifies the
learning task and improves model performance. The code will be released to
facilitate further research.

TL;DR: The paper proposes NaViL, a native MLLM trained end-to-end, exploring optimal architecture and scaling properties under data constraints, achieving competitive performance on 14 benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs use compositional training with separate pre-training of vision encoders and LLMs, making it difficult to explore multimodal scaling properties. The authors aim to study native end-to-end training of MLLMs.

Method: Systematic study of MLLM design space under data constraints to find optimal meta-architecture, then exploration of scaling properties between visual encoders and LLMs, leading to the proposed NaViL model with a cost-effective training recipe.

Result: NaViL achieves competitive performance against existing MLLMs on 14 multimodal benchmarks, and the study reveals positively correlated scaling relationship between visual encoders and LLMs.

Conclusion: The findings provide in-depth insights for future native MLLM research, showing that native end-to-end training with proper architecture scaling can achieve strong multimodal performance.

Abstract: Compositional training has been the de-facto paradigm in existing Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), where pre-trained vision encoders are connected
with pre-trained LLMs through continuous multimodal pre-training. However, the
multimodal scaling property of this paradigm remains difficult to explore due
to the separated training. In this paper, we focus on the native training of
MLLMs in an end-to-end manner and systematically study its design space and
scaling property under a practical setting, i.e., data constraint. Through
careful study of various choices in MLLM, we obtain the optimal
meta-architecture that best balances performance and training cost. After that,
we further explore the scaling properties of the native MLLM and indicate the
positively correlated scaling relationship between visual encoders and LLMs.
Based on these findings, we propose a native MLLM called NaViL, combined with a
simple and cost-effective recipe. Experimental results on 14 multimodal
benchmarks confirm the competitive performance of NaViL against existing MLLMs.
Besides that, our findings and results provide in-depth insights for the future
study of native MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting suffers from performance degradation and instability under sparse-view conditions, with specific failure modes in overfitting near cameras and underfitting in distant areas.

Method: Proposes D²GS framework with Depth-and-Density Guided Dropout to mask redundant Gaussians, and Distance-Aware Fidelity Enhancement for improving reconstruction in far-field areas, plus a new stability evaluation metric.

Result: Extensive experiments show significant improvements in both visual quality and robustness under sparse view conditions across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: D²GS effectively addresses sparse-view challenges in 3DGS through unified framework that handles both overfitting and underfitting issues, demonstrating enhanced performance and stability.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enable real-time,
high-fidelity novel view synthesis (NVS) with explicit 3D representations.
However, performance degradation and instability remain significant under
sparse-view conditions. In this work, we identify two key failure modes under
sparse-view conditions: overfitting in regions with excessive Gaussian density
near the camera, and underfitting in distant areas with insufficient Gaussian
coverage. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework D$^2$GS,
comprising two key components: a Depth-and-Density Guided Dropout strategy that
suppresses overfitting by adaptively masking redundant Gaussians based on
density and depth, and a Distance-Aware Fidelity Enhancement module that
improves reconstruction quality in under-fitted far-field areas through
targeted supervision. Moreover, we introduce a new evaluation metric to
quantify the stability of learned Gaussian distributions, providing insights
into the robustness of the sparse-view 3DGS. Extensive experiments on multiple
datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves both visual quality
and robustness under sparse view conditions. The project page can be found at:

Motivation: Address the limitations of VLMs in complex reasoning and decision-making due to scarcity of high-quality multimodal trajectories and costly manual annotation.

Method: Construct M-TRACE dataset (28.5K multimodal tasks with 177K trajectories) for imitation-based tuning, develop MATRIX Agent controller, and introduce Pref-X (11K preference pairs) for step-wise preference learning.

Result: MATRIX consistently surpasses both open- and closed-source VLMs across three benchmarks (Agent-X, GTA, and GAIA), demonstrating scalable and effective multimodal tool use.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables scalable and effective multimodal tool use through automatic trajectory synthesis and preference learning, with publicly available data and code.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed as controllers with
access to external tools for complex reasoning and decision-making, yet their
effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal
trajectories and the cost of manual annotation. We address this challenge with
a vision-centric agent tuning framework that automatically synthesizes
multimodal trajectories, generates step-wise preference pairs, and trains a VLM
controller for robust tool-use reasoning. Our pipeline first constructs
M-TRACE, a large-scale dataset of 28.5K multimodal tasks with 177K verified
trajectories, enabling imitation-based trajectory tuning. Building on this, we
develop MATRIX Agent, a controller finetuned on M-TRACE for step-wise tool
reasoning. To achieve finer alignment, we further introduce Pref-X, a set of
11K automatically generated preference pairs, and optimize MATRIX on it via
step-wise preference learning. Across three benchmarks, Agent-X, GTA, and GAIA,
MATRIX consistently surpasses both open- and closed-source VLMs, demonstrating
scalable and effective multimodal tool use. Our data and code is avaliable at

TL;DR: ReSplat is a recurrent Gaussian splatting model that iteratively refines 3D Gaussians using rendering error as feedback, achieving state-of-the-art performance with fewer Gaussians and faster rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feed-forward Gaussian splatting models are limited by single-pass inference. The authors aim to improve performance through iterative refinement without explicit gradient computation.

Method: Uses rendering error as feedback signal for recurrent network to update Gaussians. Initializes with compact reconstruction model in 16x subsampled space, producing 16x fewer Gaussians than per-pixel models.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across varying input views (2-16), resolutions (256×256 to 540×960), and datasets (DL3DV, RealEstate10K), while reducing Gaussians count and improving rendering speed.

Conclusion: ReSplat demonstrates that rendering error can effectively guide Gaussian refinement, enabling robust generalization and computational efficiency in 3D scene reconstruction.

Abstract: While feed-forward Gaussian splatting models provide computational efficiency
and effectively handle sparse input settings, their performance is
fundamentally limited by the reliance on a single forward pass during
inference. We propose ReSplat, a feed-forward recurrent Gaussian splatting
model that iteratively refines 3D Gaussians without explicitly computing
gradients. Our key insight is that the Gaussian splatting rendering error
serves as a rich feedback signal, guiding the recurrent network to learn
effective Gaussian updates. This feedback signal naturally adapts to unseen
data distributions at test time, enabling robust generalization. To initialize
the recurrent process, we introduce a compact reconstruction model that
operates in a $16 \times$ subsampled space, producing $16 \times$ fewer
Gaussians than previous per-pixel Gaussian models. This substantially reduces
computational overhead and allows for efficient Gaussian updates. Extensive
experiments across varying of input views (2, 8, 16), resolutions ($256 \times
256$ to $540 \times 960$), and datasets (DL3DV and RealEstate10K) demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly
reducing the number of Gaussians and improving the rendering speed. Our project

TL;DR: Flexible intelligent metasurfaces (FIM) outperform traditional rigid RIS by enabling both phase control and surface shape morphing to optimize wireless channel conditions in SISO and MISO systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rigid reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have limitations in adapting to complex channel environments. FIM technology offers the potential to significantly improve spectral and energy efficiency in wireless networks by enabling dynamic surface shape adjustments.

Method: For SISO systems: joint optimization of FIM phase shift matrix and surface shape using particle swarm optimization (PSO) and multi-interval gradient descent (MIGD). For MISO systems: alternating optimization algorithm for transmit beamforming, FIM surface shape, and phase shift matrix.

Result: Simulation results show FIM significantly improves channel gain compared to traditional RIS and demonstrates good adaptability to multipath channels.

Conclusion: FIM technology provides superior performance over traditional RIS by enabling both phase control and surface morphing, making it highly effective for optimizing wireless communications in complex channel environments.

Abstract: Flexible intelligent metasurface (FIM) technology holds immense potential for
increasing the spectral efficiency and energy efficiency of wireless networks.
In contrast to traditional rigid reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), an
FIM consists of an array of elements, each capable of independently tuning
electromagnetic signals, while flexibly adjusting its position along the
direction perpendicular to the surface. In contrast to traditional rigid
metasurfaces, FIM is capable of morphing its surface shape to attain better
channel conditions. In this paper, we investigate the single-input
single-output (SISO) and multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication
systems aided by a transmissive FIM. In the SISO scenario, we jointly optimize
the FIM phase shift matrix and surface shape to maximize the end-to-end channel
gain. First, we derive the optimal phase-shift matrix for each tentative FIM
surface shape to decompose the high-dimensional non-convex optimization problem
into multiple one-dimensional subproblems. Then, we utilize the particle swarm
optimization (PSO) algorithm and the multi-interval gradient descent (MIGD)
method for updating the FIM's surface shape to maximize the channel gain. In
the MISO scenario, we jointly optimize the transmit beamforming, the FIM
surface shape, and the phase shift matrix to maximize the channel gain. To
tackle this complex problem with multiple highly coupled variables, an
efficient alternating optimization algorithm is proposed. Simulation results
demonstrate that FIM significantly improves channel gain compared to
traditional RIS and exhibits good adaptability to multipath channels.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop new approaches for identifying different signal components from time-frequency representations by leveraging well-established graph clustering methods.

Method: Formulate signal component identification as a graph clustering problem where signal components correspond to strongly connected subgraphs with minimal connections between clusters.

Result: Numerical experiments demonstrate that graph clustering techniques can effectively identify signal components in time-frequency representations.

Conclusion: Graph clustering provides a powerful framework for signal component identification, offering numerous new approaches by connecting time-frequency analysis with established graph theory methods.

Abstract: We show that the problem of identifying different signal components from a
time-frequency representation can be equivalently phrased as a graph clustering
problem: given a graph $G=(V,E)$ one aims to identify `clusters', subgraphs
that are strongly connected and have relatively few connections between them.

Abstract: This letter investigates the joint sensing problem between unmanned aerial

Motivation: Current SMPC protocols suffer from computational and communicational inefficiencies, limiting their practical application in information security and privacy domains.

Method: Designed a model-free reinforcement learning model that dynamically learns and adapts optimal strategies for secure computations.

Result: Experimental results show substantial reduction in execution time and communication costs of the protocols.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning has high potential for improving SMPC protocol efficiency and provides an effective solution to existing challenges in this field.

Abstract: In this manuscript, we explore the application of model-free reinforcement
learning in optimizing secure multiparty computation (SMPC) protocols. SMPC is
a crucial tool for performing computations on private data without the need to
disclose it, holding significant importance in various domains, including
information security and privacy. However, the efficiency of current protocols
is often suboptimal due to computational and communicational complexities. Our
proposed approach leverages model-free reinforcement learning algorithms to
enhance the performance of these protocols. We have designed a reinforcement
learning model capable of dynamically learning and adapting optimal strategies
for secure computations. Our experimental results demonstrate that employing
this method leads to a substantial reduction in execution time and
communication costs of the protocols. These achievements highlight the high
potential of reinforcement learning in improving the efficiency of secure
multiparty computation protocols, providing an effective solution to the
existing challenges in this field.

*Joseph M. Carlson,Nitish V. Deshpande,Miguel Rodrigo Castellanos,Robert W. Heath Jr*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) offer low-power beamforming for wideband MIMO systems. The paper develops gain approximations accounting for practical DMA limitations and proposes a successive beamforming algorithm that improves spectral efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DMAs provide low-power beamforming compared to traditional phase shifters, making them attractive for power-efficient MIMO arrays. However, their wideband performance with practical design constraints needs investigation.

Method: Developed approximations for DMA beamforming gain considering waveguide attenuation, element frequency-selectivity, and limited tunability. Proposed a successive beamforming algorithm that sequentially configures each DMA element to optimize wideband performance.

Result: Simulations in LOS wideband systems showed accurate gain approximations compared to simulated DMA models. The proposed successive beamforming algorithm increased overall spectral efficiency compared to baseline DMA beamforming methods.

Conclusion: DMAs are viable for wideband communications when accounting for practical constraints. The developed approximations provide key insights into wideband performance, and the successive beamforming algorithm effectively improves spectral efficiency in DMA-based systems.

Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMA) provide low-power beamforming through
reconfigurable radiative slots. Each slot has a tunable component that consumes
low power compared to typical analog components like phase shifters. This makes
DMAs a potential candidate to minimize the power consumption of multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) antenna arrays. In this paper, we investigate the use of
DMAs in a wideband communication setting with practical DMA design
characteristics. We develop approximations for the DMA beamforming gain that
account for the effects of waveguide attenuation, element
frequency-selectivity, and limited reconfigurability of the tunable components
as a function of the signal bandwidth. The approximations allow for key
insights into the wideband performance of DMAs in terms of different design
variables. We develop a simple successive beamforming algorithm to improve the
wideband performance of DMAs by sequentially configuring each DMA element.
Simulation results for a line-of-sight (LOS) wideband system show the accuracy
of the approximations with the simulated DMA model in terms of spectral
efficiency. We also find that the proposed successive beamforming algorithm
increases the overall spectral efficiency of the DMA-based wideband system
compared with a baseline DMA beamforming method.

Abstract: The evolution of radio access networks (RANs) toward virtualization and
openness creates new opportunities for flexible, cost-effective, and
high-performance deployments. Achieving real-time and energy-efficient baseband
processing on commercial off-the-shelf platforms, however, remains a critical

multiple-output (MIMO) detection, and forward error correction, are well
aligned with SIMD's data-level parallelism. We then present practical design
guidelines and prototype results, showing significant improvements in

TL;DR: Analysis of target parameter estimation errors in passive radar systems when the transmitted illuminator waveform is imperfectly known.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify the impact of imperfect knowledge of the transmitted Illuminator of Opportunity (IO) waveform on target parameter estimation accuracy in passive radar systems.

Method: Analyzed the error contribution from imperfect waveform knowledge and derived a sufficient condition for this error to be negligible compared to clutter and noise errors.

Result: Identified the additional error due to imperfect waveform knowledge and established when this error becomes negligible relative to surveillance channel errors.

Conclusion: The paper provides analytical conditions under which imperfect knowledge of the transmitted IO waveform does not significantly impact target parameter estimation in passive radar systems.

Abstract: A passive radar system uses one or more so-called Illuminators of Opportunity
(IO) to detect and localize targets. In such systems, a reference channel is
often used at each receiving node to capture the transmitted IO signal, while
targets are detected using the main surveillance channel. The purpose of the
present contribution is to analyze a method for estimating the target
parameters in such a system. Specifically, we quantify the additional error
contribution due to not knowing the transmitted IO waveform perfectly. A
sufficient condition for this error to be negligible as compared to errors due
to clutter and noise in the surveillance channel is then given.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address unpredictable phase deviations in spaceborne phased arrays for LEO satellite communications, which can degrade system performance.

Method: Joint estimation of phase deviations and unknown channel using multiple pilot transmissions, derivation of Cramer Rao Bound, and optimization of beam patterns.

Result: The proposed OTA phase calibration algorithm achieves RMSEs that closely approach the CRB, and beam pattern optimization provides over 4dB SNR gain compared to random patterns.

Conclusion: The OTA phase calibration method is effective for spaceborne phased arrays in LEO satellite communications, with beam pattern optimization significantly improving performance.

Abstract: To avoid the unpredictable phase deviations of the spaceborne phased array
(SPA), this paper considers the over-the-air (OTA) phase calibration of the SPA
for the low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications, where the phase
deviations of the SPA and the unknown channel are jointly estimated with
multiple transmissions of the pilots. Moreover, the Cramer Rao Bound (CRB) is
derived, and the optimization of beam patterns is also presented to lower the
root mean squared error (RMSE) of the OTA calibration. The simulation results
verify the effectiveness of the proposed OTA phase calibration algorithm as the
RMSEs of the phase estimates closely approach the corresponding CRB, and the
beam pattern optimization scheme is also validated for more than 4dB gain of
SNR over the randomly generated beam patterns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide reliable communication services in B5G/6G mmWave systems by addressing the challenge of consistent and accurate beam tracking with reduced complexity.

Method: Transforms beam tracking into acquiring beam clusters in channel chart using contrastive learning to project high-dimensional channel state information into low-dimensional feature space preserving spatial proximities, with dynamic candidate beam acquisition strategy.

Result: Achieves 98.27% accuracy in simulations, reduces beam scanning times by up to 55.9% compared to existing methods, and demonstrates excellent communication quality in field tests during mobility.

Conclusion: The proposed channel charting-based beam tracking algorithm effectively reduces scanning complexity while maintaining high prediction accuracy, making it suitable for reliable mmWave communication in B5G/6G systems.

Abstract: In the beyond fifth-generation (B5G) and upcoming sixth-generation (6G)
wireless communication systems, millimeter (mmWave) wave technology is a
promising solution for offering additional bandwidth resources and mitigating
spectrum congestion. Beam tracking is an essential procedure for providing
reliable communication services in the mmWave communication system, with the
challenge of providing consistent and accurate tracking performance. In this
study, we introduce a low-overhead beam tracking algorithm based on channel
charting, which significantly reduces beam scanning times during the tracking
process. By projecting the beam information to the channel chart, the beam
tracking problem is transformed into the acquisition of the beam cluster in the
channel chart. Leveraging contrastive learning, the proposed channel chart
projects high-dimensional channel state information into a low-dimensional
feature space that preserves spatial proximities. Using a dynamic candidate
beam acquisition strategy, the complexity of our beam tracking algorithm is
significantly reduced. The proposed algorithm significantly reduces scanning
complexity while maintaining high prediction accuracy, achieving an accuracy of
98.27\% in simulation environments. Compared to existing methods, the proposed
method can reduce beam scanning times by up to 55.9\%. In addition, we also
performed field tests, and the measured results demonstrated excellent
communication quality during mobility.

TL;DR: A novel symmetrical MIMU formulation for gyro-free AHRS that decouples linear and rotational acceleration components, achieving 30% reduction in attitude errors and 95% rotation detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inherent instability and divergence issues in gyro-free MIMU configurations, which are beneficial for outlier detection but problematic for practical navigation applications.

Method: Developed symmetrical MIMU arrangement with diagonal IMU pairs, derived theoretical foundations for GF equations, implemented nonlinear least squares estimation, and integrated statistical hypothesis testing into AHRS error-state extended Kalman filter.

Result: 30% average reduction in attitude estimation errors, rotation detection accuracy exceeding 95% improvement, and significantly improved stability compared to standard GF implementation.

Conclusion: The symmetrical MIMU formulation enables reliable gyro-free navigation for applications where gyroscopes are unavailable, unreliable, or energy-constrained, such as miniature platforms and long-endurance marine platforms.

Abstract: Attitude and heading reference systems (AHRS) play a central role in
autonomous navigation systems on land, air and maritime platforms. AHRS utilize
inertial sensor measurements to estimate platform orientation. In recent years,
there has been increasing interest in multiple inertial measurement units
(MIMU) arrays to improve navigation accuracy and robustness. A particularly
challenging MIMU implementation is the gyro-free (GF) configuration, in which
angular velocity is derived solely from accelerometer measurements. While the
GF configurations have multiple benefits, including outlier detection and in
angular acceleration measurements, their main drawbacks are inherent
instability and an increased divergence rate. To address these shortcomings, we
introduce a novel symmetrical MIMU formulation, in which the IMUs are arranged
in symmetric diagonal pairs to decouple linear and rotational acceleration
components. To this end, we derive the theoretical foundations for the
symmetrical MIMU formulation of the GF equations, develop a nonlinear least
squares estimation process, and integrate statistical hypothesis testing into
an AHRS error-state extended Kalman filter. We validate our approach using
real-world datasets containing 85 minutes of navigation data recorded on both
airborne and land platforms. Our results demonstrated a 30\% average reduction
in attitude estimation errors, rotation detection accuracy exceeding 95\%
improvement, and significantly improved stability compared to a standard GF
implementation. These results enable reliable GF navigation in applications
where gyroscopes are unavailable, unreliable, or energy-constrained. Common
examples include miniature platforms, computational-constraint platforms, and
long-endurance marine platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the performance bottlenecks in neural radiance fields (NeRF) caused by frequent external memory accesses and cache misses, which limit throughput and energy efficiency in 3D reconstruction and rendering applications.

Method: Proposes a four-stage scheduler with Z-order ray clustering, lagging ray prioritization, spatial proximity-based RP reordering, and out-of-order sample issuing. Integrates four-tier hierarchical RP marching with AABB for spatial skipping and uses balanced feature storage allocation to mitigate SRAM bank conflicts.

Result: The EDR-NR chip fabricated in 40nm process shows 2.41x improvement in normalized energy efficiency, 1.21x in normalized area efficiency, 1.20x in normalized throughput, and 53.42% reduction in on-chip SRAM consumption compared to state-of-the-art accelerators.

Conclusion: The EDR-NR architecture successfully optimizes NeRF processing by exploiting spatial locality and implementing efficient data reuse strategies, achieving significant performance improvements in energy efficiency, area efficiency, throughput, and memory consumption.

Abstract: Neural radiance fields (NeRF) have transformed 3D reconstruction and
rendering, facilitating photorealistic image synthesis from sparse viewpoints.
This work introduces an explicit data reuse neural rendering (EDR-NR)
architecture, which reduces frequent external memory accesses (EMAs) and cache
misses by exploiting the spatial locality from three phases, including rays,
ray packets (RPs), and samples. The EDR-NR architecture features a four-stage
scheduler that clusters rays on the basis of Z-order, prioritize lagging rays
when ray divergence happens, reorders RPs based on spatial proximity, and
issues samples out-of-orderly (OoO) according to the availability of on-chip
feature data. In addition, a four-tier hierarchical RP marching (HRM) technique
is integrated with an axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) to facilitate spatial
skipping (SS), reducing redundant computations and improving throughput.
Moreover, a balanced allocation strategy for feature storage is proposed to
mitigate SRAM bank conflicts. Fabricated using a 40 nm process with a die area
of 10.5 mmX, the EDR-NR chip demonstrates a 2.41X enhancement in normalized
energy efficiency, a 1.21X improvement in normalized area efficiency, a 1.20X
increase in normalized throughput, and a 53.42% reduction in on-chip SRAM
consumption compared to state-of-the-art accelerators.

TL;DR: Curriculum learning with diffusion-based synthetic augmentation improves detection of difficult pulmonary nodules in chest X-rays, achieving better performance than baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in detecting difficult pulmonary nodules (low size, brightness, contrast) due to data imbalance and limited annotation in conventional AI models.

Method: Used Faster R-CNN with FPN backbone trained on hybrid dataset including NODE21, VinDr-CXR, CheXpert, and 11,206 DDPM-generated synthetic images. Difficulty scores guided curriculum learning.

Result: Curriculum model achieved mean AUC of 0.95 vs 0.89 baseline (p<0.001), with sensitivity 70% vs 48% and accuracy 82% vs 70%. Consistent improvements across all difficulty levels.

Conclusion: Curriculum-guided synthetic augmentation enhances model robustness and generalization for pulmonary nodule detection.

Abstract: This study evaluates whether integrating curriculum learning with
diffusion-based synthetic augmentation can enhance the detection of difficult
pulmonary nodules in chest radiographs, particularly those with low size,
brightness, and contrast, which often challenge conventional AI models due to
data imbalance and limited annotation. A Faster R-CNN with a Feature Pyramid
Network (FPN) backbone was trained on a hybrid dataset comprising
expert-labeled NODE21 (1,213 patients; 52.4 percent male; mean age 63.2 +/-
11.5 years), VinDr-CXR, CheXpert, and 11,206 DDPM-generated synthetic images.
Difficulty scores based on size, brightness, and contrast guided curriculum
learning. Performance was compared to a non-curriculum baseline using mean
average precision (mAP), Dice score, and area under the curve (AUC).
Statistical tests included bootstrapped confidence intervals, DeLong tests, and
paired t-tests. The curriculum model achieved a mean AUC of 0.95 versus 0.89
for the baseline (p < 0.001), with improvements in sensitivity (70 percent vs.
48 percent) and accuracy (82 percent vs. 70 percent). Stratified analysis
demonstrated consistent gains across all difficulty bins (Easy to Very Hard).
Grad-CAM visualizations confirmed more anatomically focused attention under
curriculum learning. These results suggest that curriculum-guided synthetic
augmentation enhances model robustness and generalization for pulmonary nodule
detection.

Result: The review systematically organizes and analyzes existing approaches to address the fundamental trade-off between spatial and angular resolution in light field imaging.

Conclusion: Light field imaging provides rich visual information for computer vision applications, but significant challenges remain in achieving high spatial-angular resolution and high frame rate capture, requiring continued research in acquisition techniques and super-resolution algorithms.

Abstract: Advances in portability and low cost of plenoptic cameras have revived
interest in light field imaging. Light-field imaging has evolved into a
technology that enables us to capture richer visual information. This
high-dimensional representation of visual data provides a powerful way to
understand the scene, with remarkable improvement in traditional computer
vision problems such as depth sensing , post-capture refocusing , material
classification, segmentation, and video stabilization. Capturing light fields

sensors, with limited processing speed. In this paper, we presented an
extensive literature review of light field acquisition techniques, challenges
associated with different capturing methodology and algorithms proposed for

TL;DR: SatFusion is a unified framework that enhances satellite IoT images by fusing multi-temporal and multi-source data through temporal alignment, texture injection, and adaptive composition modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to fully exploit complementary information in temporal and source dimensions. MISR has limited texture details, while pansharpening is sensitive to noise and misregistration.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) MTIF module for deep feature alignment with panchromatic images, 2) MSIF module for injecting fine-grained texture information, 3) Fusion Composition module for adaptive integration with spectral consistency refinement.

Result: Extensive experiments on WorldStrat, WV3, QB, and GF2 datasets show significant improvements in fusion quality, robustness under challenging conditions, and generalizability to real-world Sat-IoT scenarios.

Conclusion: SatFusion effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by unifying multi-temporal and multi-source fusion, demonstrating superior performance and practical applicability in satellite IoT applications.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of the digital society, the proliferation of
satellites in the Satellite Internet of Things (Sat-IoT) has led to the
continuous accumulation of large-scale multi-temporal and multi-source images
across diverse application scenarios. However, existing methods fail to fully
exploit the complementary information embedded in both temporal and source
dimensions. For example, Multi-Image Super-Resolution (MISR) enhances
reconstruction quality by leveraging temporal complementarity across multiple
observations, yet the limited fine-grained texture details in input images
constrain its performance. Conversely, pansharpening integrates multi-source
images by injecting high-frequency spatial information from panchromatic data,
but typically relies on pre-interpolated low-resolution inputs and assumes
noise-free alignment, making it highly sensitive to noise and misregistration.
To address these issues, we propose SatFusion: A Unified Framework for
Enhancing Satellite IoT Images via Multi-Temporal and Multi-Source Data Fusion.
Specifically, SatFusion first employs a Multi-Temporal Image Fusion (MTIF)
module to achieve deep feature alignment with the panchromatic image. Then, a
Multi-Source Image Fusion (MSIF) module injects fine-grained texture
information from the panchromatic data. Finally, a Fusion Composition module
adaptively integrates the complementary advantages of both modalities while
dynamically refining spectral consistency, supervised by a weighted combination
of multiple loss functions. Extensive experiments on the WorldStrat, WV3, QB,
and GF2 datasets demonstrate that SatFusion significantly improves fusion
quality, robustness under challenging conditions, and generalizability to
real-world Sat-IoT scenarios. The code is available at:

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Survey of recent results on list recovery codes, covering possibility results, impossibility results, and open questions, while highlighting their applications beyond coding theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: List recovery generalizes unique and list decoding by handling soft information in the form of input lists, and has become important in both coding theory and broader theoretical computer science.

Method: Survey approach analyzing recent research on list recovery codes, examining both constructive results (existence of codes with certain properties) and impossibility results.

Result: The article demonstrates that list recovery codes have evolved from being components in list decoding to having numerous applications across theoretical computer science.

Conclusion: List recovery codes are fundamental objects with rich theoretical properties and wide-ranging applications beyond their original coding theory context.

Abstract: List recovery is a fundamental task for error-correcting codes, vastly
generalizing unique decoding from worst-case errors and list decoding. Briefly,
one is given ''soft information'' in the form of input lists S_1,...,S_n of
bounded size, and one argues that there are not too many codewords that agree a
lot with this soft information. This general problem appears in many guises,
both within coding theory and in theoretical computer science more broadly.
  In this article we survey recent results on list recovery codes, introducing
both the ''good'' (i.e., possibility results, showing that codes with certain
list recoverability exist), the ''bad'' (impossibility results), and the
''unknown''. We additionally demonstrate that, while list recoverable codes
were initially introduced as a component in list decoding concatenated codes,
they have since found myriad applications to and connections with other topics
in theoretical computer science.

### [122] [Is star complexity a proxy for information based complexity of graphs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07722)
*Russell K. Standish*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper investigates the relationship between different information-based complexity (IBC) measures for graphs, comparing Standish's link-based measure with star complexity and finding empirical correlations between them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the hypothesis that practical IBC measures are asymptotically equivalent, and to explore the relationship between different graph complexity measures.

Method: Constructed 10 and 22 vertex graphs up to star complexity of 8, empirically compared C* (IBC related to star complexity) with C (Standish's measure), and found an easily computable upper bound for star complexity.

Result: Found strong correlation between C* and C, and discovered that an easily computable upper bound of star complexity is strongly related to C.

Conclusion: The results support the hypothesis that practical IBC measures are asymptotically equivalent, and provide empirical evidence for the relationship between different graph complexity measures.

Abstract: Information-based complexity (IBC) is a well-defined complexity measure of
any object given a description in a language and a classifier that identifies
those descriptions with the object. Of course, the exact numerical value will
vary according to the descriptive language and classifier, but under certain
universality conditions (eg the classifier identifies programs of a universal
Turning machine that halt and output the same value), asymptotically, the
complexity measure is independent of the classifier up to a constant of O(1).
The hypothesis being investigated in this work that any practical IBC measure
will similarly be asymptotically equivalent to any other practical IBC measure.
Standish presented an IBC measure for graphs ${\cal C}$ that encoded graphs by
their links, and identifies graphs as those that are automorphic to each other.
An interesting alternate graph measure is {\em star complexity}, which is
defined as the number of union and intersection operations of basic stars that
can generate the original graph. Whilst not an IBC itself, it can be related to
an IBC (called ${\cal C}^*$) that is strongly correlated with star complexity.
In this paper, 10 and 22 vertex graphs are constructed up to a star complexity
of 8, and the ${\cal C}^*$ compared emprically with ${\cal C}$. Finally, an
easily computable upper bound of star complexity is found to be strongly
related to ${\cal C}$.

diffuse emission or LiDAR-assisted schemes requiring bulky sensing modules, the
proposed VCSEL-based approach exploits narrow Gaussian beams and multimode
diversity to enable compact, low-power, and analytically tractable integration.
We derive closed-form expressions to jointly recover user position and
orientation from received signal strength using only five VCSELs, and reduce
this requirement to three under specific geometric conditions by leveraging
dual-mode operation. In parallel, we introduce a VCSEL-based mapping method
that uses reflected signal time-of-arrival measurements to detect obstructions
and guide blockage-resilient RIS beam routing. Simulation results demonstrate
millimeter-level localization accuracy, robust obstacle detection, high
spectral efficiency, and substantial gains in minimum user rate. These findings
establish VCSEL-based LeRIS as a scalable and practically integrable enabler
for resilient 6G wireless systems with multi-functional PWEs.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Optimal rank-adaptive matrix estimation from linear measurements with adaptive rank selection balancing estimation precision and approximation cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To design optimal rank-adaptive algorithms for high-dimensional matrix estimation that can automatically determine the effective rank based on data, addressing fundamental trade-offs in rank selection.

Method: Combines Least-Squares estimator with universal singular value thresholding procedure, with enhanced analysis of matrix denoising methods based on singular value thresholding.

Result: Established instance-specific lower bounds for sample complexity, identified optimal effective rank dependencies, and proposed algorithm with finite-sample error bounds that nearly match fundamental limits.

Conclusion: The proposed rank-adaptive algorithm achieves near-optimal performance by adaptively determining effective rank, with applications validated in multivariate regression and linear dynamical system identification.

Abstract: We address the problem of estimating a high-dimensional matrix from linear
measurements, with a focus on designing optimal rank-adaptive algorithms. These
algorithms infer the matrix by estimating its singular values and the
corresponding singular vectors up to an effective rank, adaptively determined
based on the data. We establish instance-specific lower bounds for the sample
complexity of such algorithms, uncovering fundamental trade-offs in selecting
the effective rank: balancing the precision of estimating a subset of singular
values against the approximation cost incurred for the remaining ones. Our
analysis identifies how the optimal effective rank depends on the matrix being
estimated, the sample size, and the noise level. We propose an algorithm that
combines a Least-Squares estimator with a universal singular value thresholding
procedure. We provide finite-sample error bounds for this algorithm and
demonstrate that its performance nearly matches the derived fundamental limits.
Our results rely on an enhanced analysis of matrix denoising methods based on
singular value thresholding. We validate our findings with applications to
multivariate regression and linear dynamical system identification.

### [125] [Exponential Error Bounds for Information Bottleneck Source Coding Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08364)
*Han Wu,Hamdi Joudeh*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the information bottleneck (IB) source coding problem under logarithmic loss, establishing exact error exponents and strong converse exponents through matching upper and lower bounds. It also reveals a code-level connection between IB source coding and the Wyner-Ahlswede-Körner (WAK) problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how fast the excess distortion probability converges to 0 or 1 in IB source coding depending on whether the rate is above or below the rate-distortion function, and to establish connections between different source coding problems.

Method: Derived matching upper and lower exponential bounds through optimizations over auxiliary random variables, extending existing sphere packing and single-letterization techniques. Also established code-level connections between IB source coding and source coding with a helper (WAK problem).

Result: Obtained exact error exponent and exact strong converse exponent for IB source coding. Showed that every code for the WAK problem is a code for IB source coding, and re-derived the best known sphere packing exponent of the WAK problem with operational interpretation.

Conclusion: The paper provides complete characterization of error exponents for IB source coding and reveals fundamental connections between different source coding frameworks, offering new insights into their relationships and performance limits.

Abstract: We study the information bottleneck (IB) source coding problem, also known as
remote lossy source coding under logarithmic loss. Based on a rate-limited
description of noisy observations, the receiver produces a soft estimate for
the remote source, i.e., a probability distribution, evaluated under the
logarithmic loss. We focus on the excess distortion probability of IB source
coding and investigate how fast it converges to 0 or 1, depending on whether
the rate is above or below the rate-distortion function. The latter case is
also known as the exponential strong converse. We establish both the exact
error exponent and the exact strong converse exponent for IB source coding by
deriving matching upper and lower exponential bounds. The obtained exponents
involve optimizations over auxiliary random variables. The matching converse
bounds are derived through non-trivial extensions of existing sphere packing
and single-letterization techniques, which we adapt to incorporate auxiliary
random variables.
  In the second part of this paper, we establish a code-level connection
between IB source coding and source coding with a helper, also known as the
Wyner-Ahlswede-K\"orner (WAK) problem. We show that every code for the WAK
problem is a code for IB source coding. This requires noticing that IB source
coding, under the excess distortion criterion, is equivalent to source coding
with a helper available at both the transmitter and the receiver; the latter in
turn relates to the WAK problem. Through this connection, we re-derive the best
known sphere packing exponent of the WAK problem, and provide it with an
operational interpretation.

*Mohammadreza Bakhshizadeh Mohajer,Alex Dytso,Daniela Tuninetti,Luca Barletta*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: A novel rate-distortion bound (RDB) is introduced for ISAC systems, overcoming limitations of classical bounds like BCRB and applicable to arbitrary parameter distributions and distortion measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fundamental performance limits in ISAC systems by overcoming restrictive regularity conditions of classical estimation theory bounds like BCRB.

Method: Proposes a rate-distortion theory-based converse bound that works for arbitrary parameter distributions and distortion measures (including MSE and probability of error).

Result: The RDB is tight in high sensing noise regime and can be strictly tighter than BCRB in low noise regime. Demonstrated effectiveness on Nakagami fading channel estimation and binary occupancy detection.

Conclusion: The rate-distortion bound provides a powerful and general tool for characterizing ultimate performance tradeoffs in ISAC systems with broad applicability.

Abstract: This paper addresses the fundamental performance limits of Integrated Sensing
and Communication (ISAC) systems by introducing a novel converse bound based on
rate-distortion theory. This rate-distortion bound (RDB) overcomes the
restrictive regularity conditions of classical estimation theory, such as the
Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao Bound (BCRB). The proposed framework is broadly
applicable, holding for arbitrary parameter distributions and distortion
measures, including mean-squared error and probability of error. The bound is
proved to be tight in the high sensing noise regime and can be strictly tighter
than the BCRB in the low sensing noise regime. The RDB's utility is
demonstrated on two challenging scenarios: Nakagami fading channel estimation,
where it provides a valid bound even when the BCRB is inapplicable, and a
binary occupancy detection task, showcasing its versatility for discrete
sensing problems. This work provides a powerful and general tool for
characterizing the ultimate performance tradeoffs in ISAC systems.

*Faruk Alpay,Hamdi Alakkad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Truth-Aware Decoding (TAD) is a verification-oriented decoding scheme that aligns neural language generation with knowledge bases using semantic guards at decode time, reducing hallucinations without sacrificing throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between large-scale empirical language models and formal verification by ensuring generated text aligns with knowledge bases and reduces factual errors.

Method: Uses constraint-based semantics with semantic guards operating at decode time, greedy selection with local likelihood dominance, entropy-style invariant for factual risk quantification, and multi-agent operational calculus with verified Lean artefacts.

Result: Numerical and algorithmic case studies confirm that TAD reduces hallucinations without sacrificing throughput, providing a practical bridge between empirical models and formal verification.

Conclusion: TAD offers a pragmatic approach to align neural language generation with knowledge bases through verification-oriented decoding, successfully reducing factual errors while maintaining model performance.

Abstract: This paper introduces Truth-Aware Decoding (TAD), a verification-oriented
decoding scheme that aligns neural language generation with knowledge bases.
Situated in the tradition of probabilistic program semantics for sequence
models, TAD augments modern instruction-tuned systems with a lattice of
semantic guards that operate at decode time. Our contributions are fourfold:
(i) a constraint-based semantics that renders oracle filtering as a
program-logic judgment, (ii) a proof that greedy selection enjoys local
likelihood dominance under sound and complete guards (Theorem 2.7), (iii) an
entropy-style invariant that quantifies factual risk via knowledge-aware safe
mass, and (iv) a multi-agent operational calculus with verified Lean artefacts
to certify implementation behaviour. Numerical and algorithmic case studies
confirm that the resulting guardrails reduce hallucinations without sacrificing
throughput, yielding a pragmatic bridge between large-scale empirical models
and formal verification.

*Tianxiang Xu,Zhichao Wen,Xinyu Zhao,Jun Wang,Yan Li,Chang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: L2M-AID is an autonomous industrial defense framework that combines LLMs with multi-agent reinforcement learning to detect and respond to sophisticated cyber-physical attacks while maintaining operational stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional industrial defense systems lack contextual awareness and struggle with multi-stage attacks in IIoT environments, requiring a more adaptive and intelligent security approach.

Method: Uses LLMs as semantic bridges to translate unstructured telemetry into contextual state representations, then applies Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MAPPO) with reward functions balancing security objectives and operational stability.

Result: Achieved 97.2% detection rate, reduced false positives by over 80%, improved response times by 4x, and demonstrated superior physical process stability maintenance compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: L2M-AID presents a robust new paradigm for securing critical infrastructure by effectively combining LLM semantic reasoning with multi-agent reinforcement learning for adaptive industrial defense.

Abstract: The increasing integration of Industrial IoT (IIoT) exposes critical
cyber-physical systems to sophisticated, multi-stage attacks that elude
traditional defenses lacking contextual awareness. This paper introduces
L2M-AID, a novel framework for Autonomous Industrial Defense using
LLM-empowered, Multi-agent reinforcement learning. L2M-AID orchestrates a team
of collaborative agents, each driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), to
achieve adaptive and resilient security. The core innovation lies in the deep
fusion of two AI paradigms: we leverage an LLM as a semantic bridge to
translate vast, unstructured telemetry into a rich, contextual state
representation, enabling agents to reason about adversary intent rather than
merely matching patterns. This semantically-aware state empowers a Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, MAPPO, to learn complex cooperative
strategies. The MARL reward function is uniquely engineered to balance security
objectives (threat neutralization) with operational imperatives, explicitly
penalizing actions that disrupt physical process stability. To validate our
approach, we conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark SWaT dataset and a
novel synthetic dataset generated based on the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework.
Results demonstrate that L2M-AID significantly outperforms traditional IDS,
deep learning anomaly detectors, and single-agent RL baselines across key
metrics, achieving a 97.2% detection rate while reducing false positives by
over 80% and improving response times by a factor of four. Crucially, it
demonstrates superior performance in maintaining physical process stability,
presenting a robust new paradigm for securing critical national infrastructure.

### [129] [Base Models Know How to Reason, Thinking Models Learn When](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07364)
*Constantin Venhoff,Iván Arcuschin,Philip Torr,Arthur Conmy,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Thinking models like DeepSeek R1 outperform base models by learning to deploy pre-existing reasoning capabilities at the right time rather than developing entirely new reasoning mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether thinking models learn new reasoning capabilities or simply repurpose existing base model capabilities through better deployment timing.

Method: Proposed a hybrid model that activates reasoning mechanisms in base models at appropriate times, using an unsupervised bottom-up approach to discover human-interpretable reasoning behaviors without manual assumptions.

Result: The hybrid model recovered up to 91% of the performance gap to thinking models without weight updates while steering only 12% of tokens, across three base and four thinking models on GSM8K and MATH500 benchmarks.

Conclusion: Pre-training provides most reasoning mechanisms, while post-training teaches efficient deployment timing, enabling thinking models to better utilize their inference-time compute.

Abstract: Why do thinking language models like DeepSeek R1 outperform their base
counterparts? Despite consistent performance gains, it remains unclear to what
extent thinking models learn entirely new reasoning capabilities or repurpose
pre-existing base model ones. In this work, we propose a hybrid model where we
activate reasoning mechanisms in base models at the right time to elicit
thinking-model-level reasoning chains, implying that thinking models exploit
already existing capabilities. To ground our analysis, we introduce an
unsupervised, bottom-up approach for uncovering human-interpretable reasoning
behaviors in thinking models. This approach provides an unbiased method to
discover reasoning behaviors without imposing manual or LLM-derived
assumptions. Across three base and four thinking models, using GSM8K and
MATH500, our hybrid model recovers up to 91% of the performance gap to thinking
models without any weight updates while steering only 12% of tokens.
Concretely, our empirical setup provides a simple, causal way to test the
effectiveness of existing reasoning mechanisms in base models by invoking them
directly and measuring the resulting task performance. More broadly, these
results reframe our understanding of how thinking models are trained:
pre-training is when models acquire most of their reasoning mechanisms, and
post-training teaches efficient deployment of these mechanisms at the right
time, enabling efficient use of their inference-time compute.

*Neil Natarajan,Sruthi Viswanathan,Xavier Roberts-Gaal,Michelle Marie Martel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Advocates for AI-driven continuous mental health assessment using ADHD as a case study, proposing mental health digital twins for personalized care.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current static diagnostic assessments are inadequate for dynamic mental health conditions, and there are capacity constraints in neuropsychology that limit personalized care.

Method: Proposes using generative AI for continuous experience sampling from patients and diagnostic reconciliation across care pathways, with mental health digital twins as computational models.

Result: The framework enables more frequent, patient-centered data collection and dynamic adaptation to individual needs, improving treatment accessibility and efficacy.

Conclusion: AI-driven continuous assessment and mental health digital twins represent a transformative approach to personalized mental healthcare that requires further research and operationalization.

Abstract: Static solutions don't serve a dynamic mind. Thus, we advocate a shift from
static mental health diagnostic assessments to continuous, artificial
intelligence (AI)-driven assessment. Focusing on
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as a case study, we explore how
generative AI has the potential to address current capacity constraints in
neuropsychology, potentially enabling more personalized and longitudinal care
pathways. In particular, AI can efficiently conduct frequent, low-level
experience sampling from patients and facilitate diagnostic reconciliation
across care pathways. We envision a future where mental health care benefits
from continuous, rich, and patient-centered data sampling to dynamically adapt
to individual patient needs and evolving conditions, thereby improving both
accessibility and efficacy of treatment. We further propose the use of mental
health digital twins (MHDTs) - continuously updated computational models that
capture individual symptom dynamics and trajectories - as a transformative
framework for personalized mental health care. We ground this framework in
empirical evidence and map out the research agenda required to refine and
operationalize it.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI agents are limited to static planning and brittle interactions, lacking true collaboration and adaptive reasoning capabilities needed for complex tasks.

Method: Hierarchical architecture with Manager Agent orchestrating domain-specialized Expert Agents, task decomposition, and adaptive replanning using structured feedback from failed attempts including detailed failure reasons and discovered constraints.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on FinanceBench benchmark without human feedback, achieving robust performance across reasoning-heavy tasks.

Conclusion: ProSEA demonstrates potential as a foundation for more transparent, adaptive, and human-aligned AI agents through its iterative exploration and dynamic plan refinement capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have empowered AI agents to tackle increasingly
complex tasks. However, most existing agents remain limited to static planning
and brittle interactions, falling short of true collaboration or adaptive
reasoning. We introduce ProSEA, a modular, general-purpose multi-agent
framework designed for iterative problem solving through exploration and plan
evolution. ProSEA features a hierarchical architecture in which a Manager Agent
orchestrates domain-specialized Expert Agents, decomposes tasks, and adaptively
replans based on structured feedback from failed attempts. Unlike prior
systems, ProSEA agents report not only success or failure but also detailed
reasons for failure and newly discovered constraints, enabling dynamic plan
refinement informed by exploratory traces. The framework operates autonomously
but supports seamless integration with human collaborators when needed.
Experiments on the challenging FinanceBench benchmark demonstrate that ProSEA,
even without human feedback, outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
achieves robust performance across reasoning-heavy tasks. These results
underscore ProSEA's potential as a foundation for more transparent, adaptive,
and human-aligned AI agents.

TL;DR: TESTAM+ enhances traffic forecasting by integrating physical road topology with data-driven features through a novel SpatioSemantic Expert, achieving state-of-the-art performance with fewer, strategically designed experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mixture of experts frameworks lack explicit incorporation of physical road network topology, limiting spatial modeling capabilities in traffic forecasting systems.

Method: Introduces TESTAM+ with SpatioSemantic Expert that integrates physical road topology with data-driven feature similarity through hybrid graph construction, using strategic expert selection instead of naive ensemble aggregation.

Result: Achieves 1.3% MAE reduction on METR LA (3.10 vs. 3.14) and 4.1% improvement on PEMS BAY (1.65 vs. 1.72). Optimal configuration achieves 11.5% MAE reduction vs MegaCRN on METR LA (2.99 vs. 3.38) with 53.1% lower inference latency.

Conclusion: Fewer, strategically designed experts outperform complex multi-expert ensembles, establishing new state-of-the-art performance with superior computational efficiency for real-time deployment.

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is fundamental to intelligent transportation systems,
enabling congestion mitigation and emission reduction in increasingly complex
urban environments. While recent graph neural network approaches have advanced
spatial temporal modeling, existing mixture of experts frameworks like Time
Enhanced Spatio Temporal Attention Model (TESTAM) lack explicit incorporation
of physical road network topology, limiting their spatial capabilities. We
present TESTAM+, an enhanced spatio temporal forecasting framework that
introduces a novel SpatioSemantic Expert integrating physical road topology
with data driven feature similarity through hybrid graph construction. TESTAM+
achieves significant improvements over TESTAM: 1.3% MAE reduction on METR LA
(3.10 vs. 3.14) and 4.1% improvement on PEMS BAY (1.65 vs. 1.72). Through
comprehensive ablation studies, we discover that strategic expert selection
fundamentally outperforms naive ensemble aggregation. Individual experts
demonstrate remarkable effectiveness: the Adaptive Expert achieves 1.63 MAE on
PEMS BAY, outperforming the original three expert TESTAM (1.72 MAE), while the
SpatioSemantic Expert matches this performance with identical 1.63 MAE. The
optimal Identity + Adaptive configuration achieves an 11.5% MAE reduction
compared to state of the art MegaCRN on METR LA (2.99 vs. 3.38), while reducing
inference latency by 53.1% compared to the full four expert TESTAM+. Our
findings reveal that fewer, strategically designed experts outperform complex
multi expert ensembles, establishing new state of the art performance with
superior computational efficiency for real time deployment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TS-Agent is a time series reasoning agent that combines LLMs' reasoning capabilities with specialized time series analytical tools to improve performance on time series tasks while reducing hallucination and knowledge leakage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with time series reasoning tasks, often producing outputs affected by hallucination or knowledge leakage, despite their strong general reasoning abilities.

Method: TS-Agent uses LLMs for evidence gathering and step-by-step reasoning, while delegating statistical and structural information extraction to time series analytical tools. It interacts with raw numeric sequences through atomic operators, maintains an explicit evidence log, and uses iterative refinement with self-critic and quality gate mechanisms.

Result: TS-Agent achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs on understanding benchmarks and delivers significant improvements on reasoning tasks, where existing models often rely on memorization and fail in zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: The proposed approach avoids multi-modal alignment training, preserves time series' native form, ensures interpretability and verifiability, and effectively mitigates knowledge leakage and hallucination in time series reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong abilities in reasoning and
problem solving, but recent studies reveal that they still struggle with time
series reasoning tasks, where outputs are often affected by hallucination or
knowledge leakage. In this work we propose TS-Agent, a time series reasoning
agent that leverages LLMs strictly for what they excel at, i.e., gathering
evidence and synthesizing it into conclusions through step-by-step reasoning,
while delegating the extraction of statistical and structural information to
time series analytical tools. Instead of mapping time series into text tokens,
images, or embeddings, our agent interacts with raw numeric sequences through
atomic operators, records outputs in an explicit evidence log, and iteratively
refines its reasoning under the guidance of a self-critic and a final quality
gate. This design avoids multi-modal alignment training, preserves the native
form of time series, ensures interpretability and verifiability, and mitigates
knowledge leakage or hallucination. Empirically, we evaluate the agent on
established benchmarks. Our experiments show that TS-Agent achieves performance
comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs on understanding benchmarks, and delivers
significant improvements on reasoning tasks, where existing models often rely
on memorization and fail in zero-shot settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' ability to understand process models, find errors, and reason through natural language interfaces for business process design assistance.

Method: Empirical analysis using several LLMs (including ChatGPT model o3) in zero-shot settings to understand BPMN process models from images and answer queries at different levels of depth.

Result: Vanilla LLMs are effective in understanding BPMN models and answering queries intelligently at syntactic, logic, and semantic levels, though performance varies across different LLMs.

Conclusion: LLMs can serve as valuable assistants for business process designers and users, exhibiting anthropomorphic properties in their reasoning process.

Abstract: In this paper, we report our experience with several LLMs for their ability
to understand a process model in an interactive, conversational style, find
syntactical and logical errors in it, and reason with it in depth through a
natural language (NL) interface. Our findings show that a vanilla, untrained
LLM like ChatGPT (model o3) in a zero-shot setting is effective in
understanding BPMN process models from images and answering queries about them
intelligently at syntactic, logic, and semantic levels of depth. Further,
different LLMs vary in performance in terms of their accuracy and
effectiveness. Nevertheless, our empirical analysis shows that LLMs can play a
valuable role as assistants for business process designers and users. We also
study the LLM's "thought process" and ability to perform deeper reasoning in
the context of process analysis and optimization. We find that the LLMs seem to
exhibit anthropomorphic properties.

*Diego García-Zamora,Álvaro Labella,José Rui Figueira*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Tournament Tree Method (TTM), a novel pairwise comparison framework that requires only m-1 comparisons to obtain a complete, reciprocal, and consistent comparison matrix, overcoming limitations of traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional pairwise comparison methods suffer from high cognitive load (requiring m(m-1)/2 comparisons), risk of inconsistency, and computational complexity in deriving consistent value scales.

Method: TTM consists of three phases: (i) elicitation of expert judgments using reduced targeted comparisons, (ii) construction of consistent pairwise comparison matrix, and (iii) derivation of global value scale from the resulting matrix.

Result: The method ensures consistency by design, minimizes cognitive effort, reduces preference modeling dimensionality from m(m-1)/2 to m parameters, and is compatible with classical Deck of Cards method for interval and ratio scales.

Conclusion: TTM provides a practical framework with demonstrated applicability through a web-based tool, offering significant improvements over traditional pairwise comparison methods in multi-criteria decision-making.

Abstract: Pairwise comparison methods, such as Fuzzy Preference Relations and Saaty's
Multiplicative Preference Relations, are widely used to model expert judgments
in multi-criteria decision-making. However, their application is limited by the
high cognitive load required to complete $m(m-1)/2$ comparisons, the risk of
inconsistency, and the computational complexity of deriving consistent value
scales. This paper proposes the Tournament Tree Method (TTM), a novel
elicitation and evaluation framework that overcomes these limitations. The TTM
requires only $m-1$ pairwise comparisons to obtain a complete, reciprocal, and
consistent comparison matrix. The method consists of three phases: (i)
elicitation of expert judgments using a reduced set of targeted comparisons,
(ii) construction of the consistent pairwise comparison matrix, and (iii)
derivation of a global value scale from the resulting matrix. The proposed
approach ensures consistency by design, minimizes cognitive effort, and reduces
the dimensionality of preference modeling from $m(m-1)/2$ to $m$ parameters.
Furthermore, it is compatible with the classical Deck of Cards method, and thus
it can handle interval and ratio scales. We have also developed a web-based
tool that demonstrates its practical applicability in real decision-making
scenarios.

Motivation: MIS are classified as high-risk systems under EU AI Act, requiring formal risk management to ensure compliance with trustworthy AI ethical requirements.

Method: Formalize risk reduction as constrained optimization, model with Minizinc, and compare three resolution paradigms: Mixed Integer Programming (MIP), Satisfiability (SAT), and Constraint Programming (CP).

Result: Comparative experimental study analyzing performance, expressiveness, and scalability of each approach.

Conclusion: Identifies methodology limits and provides perspectives for integrating Minizinc model into complete trustworthy AI ethical risk management process for MIS.

Abstract: Medical Intelligent Systems (MIS) are increasingly integrated into healthcare
workflows, offering significant benefits but also raising critical safety and
ethical concerns. According to the European Union AI Act, most MIS will be
classified as high-risk systems, requiring a formal risk management process to
ensure compliance with the ethical requirements of trust- worthy AI. In this
context, we focus on risk reduction optimization problems, which aim to reduce
risks with ethical considerations by finding the best balanced assignment of
risk assessment values according to their coverage of trustworthy AI ethical
requirements. We formalize this problem as a constrained optimization task and
investigate three resolution paradigms: Mixed Integer Programming (MIP),
Satisfiability (SAT), and Constraint Pro- gramming(CP).Our contributions
include the mathematical formulation of this optimization problem, its modeling
with the Minizinc constraint modeling language, and a comparative experimental
study that analyzes the performance, expressiveness, and scalability of each
ap- proach to solving. From the identified limits of the methodology, we draw
some perspectives of this work regarding the integration of the Minizinc model
into a complete trustworthy AI ethical risk management process for MIS.

Motivation: Traditional approaches for popular path queries require model training, parameter tuning, and retraining for data updates. LLMs show potential for spatial reasoning, motivating exploration of their application to geo-spatial problems without extensive retraining.

Method: A multi-agent LLM framework with two-stage pipeline: SEARCH stage identifies popular paths from historical trajectory data, and GENERATE stage synthesizes novel paths when existing paths are unavailable in the data.

Result: Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show CompassLLM achieves superior accuracy in SEARCH stage and competitive performance in GENERATE stage while being cost-effective compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: CompassLLM successfully leverages LLM reasoning capabilities for geo-spatial problems, providing an effective solution for popular path queries that avoids the retraining requirements of traditional approaches.

Abstract: The popular path query - identifying the most frequented routes between
locations from historical trajectory data - has important applications in urban
planning, navigation optimization, and travel recommendations. While
traditional algorithms and machine learning approaches have achieved success in
this domain, they typically require model training, parameter tuning, and
retraining when accommodating data updates. As Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrate increasing capabilities in spatial and graph-based reasoning, there
is growing interest in exploring how these models can be applied to geo-spatial
problems.
  We introduce CompassLLM, a novel multi-agent framework that intelligently
leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into the geo-spatial domain to
solve the popular path query. CompassLLM employs its agents in a two-stage
pipeline: the SEARCH stage that identifies popular paths, and a GENERATE stage
that synthesizes novel paths in the absence of an existing one in the
historical trajectory data. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show
that CompassLLM demonstrates superior accuracy in SEARCH and competitive
performance in GENERATE while being cost-effective.

### [139] [Measuring and Mitigating Identity Bias in Multi-Agent Debate via Anonymization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07517)
*Hyeong Kyu Choi,Xiaojin Zhu,Yixuan Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses identity bias in multi-agent debate (MAD) systems where LLMs exhibit sycophancy (uncritically adopting peers' views) and self-bias (stubbornly adhering to their own output), proposing anonymization to mitigate bias and introducing a metric to quantify it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent studies show that agents in multi-agent debate are not neutral - they suffer from identity-driven sycophancy and self-bias, which undermines the reliability of debate outcomes by prioritizing source identity over content quality.

Method: The authors formalize debate dynamics as identity-weighted Bayesian update, propose response anonymization (removing identity markers to force equal weights), and define the Identity Bias Coefficient (IBC) to measure how often agents follow peers versus themselves.

Result: Empirical studies across multiple models, datasets and debate rounds confirm that identity bias is widespread, with sycophancy being far more common than self-bias. Anonymization effectively reduces bias.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the need to mask identity in MAD systems to ensure reasoning is based on content quality rather than source identity, improving the reliability of multi-agent debate outcomes.

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) aims to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning
by letting multiple agents exchange answers and then aggregate their opinions.
Yet recent studies reveal that agents are not neutral: they are prone to
identity-driven sycophancy and self-bias, uncritically adopting a peer's view
or stubbornly adhering to their own prior output, undermining the reliability
of debate. In this work, we present the first principled framework that joins
sycophancy and self-bias to mitigate and quantify identity bias in MAD. First,
we formalize the debate dynamics as an identity-weighted Bayesian update
process. Second, we propose response anonymization: by removing identity
markers from prompts, agents cannot distinguish "self" from "peer", which
forces equal weights on agent identity, thereby reducing bias. Third, we define
the Identity Bias Coefficient (IBC), a principled metric that measures how
often an agent follows a peer versus itself. Empirical studies across multiple
models, datasets and debate rounds confirm that identity bias is widespread,
with sycophancy far more common than self-bias. Our findings highlight the need
to "mask" identity to ensure that MAD systems reason based on content rather
than source identity. Code is released in

TL;DR: Current AI evaluation methods are flawed with data contamination, selective reporting, and inadequate quality control. This paper proposes PeerBench, a community-governed, proctored evaluation framework with sealed execution, item banking, and delayed transparency to ensure trustworthy AI assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of AI has created a 'Wild West' of assessment where current benchmarks reveal critical vulnerabilities like data contamination and biased evaluations, making it difficult to distinguish genuine progress from hype and eroding public confidence.

Method: The paper introduces PeerBench, a community-governed evaluation blueprint featuring sealed execution (to prevent data leakage), item banking with rolling renewal (to maintain test integrity), and delayed transparency (to balance openness with security).

Result: The proposed PeerBench framework aims to create a unified, live, and quality-controlled benchmarking system that is robust by construction rather than relying on goodwill, addressing systemic flaws in current AI evaluation practices.

Conclusion: A paradigm shift from laissez-faire evaluation to a unified, trustworthy benchmarking framework like PeerBench is essential for sustainable AI advancement and restoring integrity in measuring AI progress, similar to how credible oversight stabilizes financial markets.

Abstract: The meteoric rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with its rapidly expanding
market capitalization, presents both transformative opportunities and critical
challenges. Chief among these is the urgent need for a new, unified paradigm
for trustworthy evaluation, as current benchmarks increasingly reveal critical
vulnerabilities. Issues like data contamination and selective reporting by
model developers fuel hype, while inadequate data quality control can lead to
biased evaluations that, even if unintentionally, may favor specific
approaches. As a flood of participants enters the AI space, this "Wild West" of
assessment makes distinguishing genuine progress from exaggerated claims
exceptionally difficult. Such ambiguity blurs scientific signals and erodes
public confidence, much as unchecked claims would destabilize financial markets
reliant on credible oversight from agencies like Moody's.
  In high-stakes human examinations (e.g., SAT, GRE), substantial effort is
devoted to ensuring fairness and credibility; why settle for less in evaluating
AI, especially given its profound societal impact? This position paper argues
that the current laissez-faire approach is unsustainable. We contend that true,
sustainable AI advancement demands a paradigm shift: a unified, live, and
quality-controlled benchmarking framework robust by construction, not by mere
courtesy and goodwill. To this end, we dissect the systemic flaws undermining
today's AI evaluation, distill the essential requirements for a new generation
of assessments, and introduce PeerBench, a community-governed, proctored
evaluation blueprint that embodies this paradigm through sealed execution, item
banking with rolling renewal, and delayed transparency. Our goal is to pave the
way for evaluations that can restore integrity and deliver genuinely
trustworthy measures of AI progress.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentAsk is a plug-and-play clarification module that prevents error propagation in multi-agent LLM systems by inserting minimal questions at message handoffs, improving accuracy with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent LLM systems often underperform single-agent baselines due to edge-level error cascades where minor inaccuracies propagate across the entire chain of message handoffs.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: (1) distill edge-level judgments from failure traces into compact policy, (2) supervise policy to determine when/what/whom/how to ask, (3) optimize online with E-GRPO reinforcement learning balancing accuracy, latency, and cost.

Result: Across math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks, AgentAsk consistently improves accuracy and robustness over public multi-agent implementations with minimal overhead (latency and extra cost <5%), approaching strong evaluator performance.

Conclusion: Provides a principled taxonomy of edge-level errors and practical recipe for link-local intervention, offering a scalable pathway toward more reliable LLM-based multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on large language models (LLMs) promise enhanced
problem-solving capabilities through collaborative division of labor. However,
they frequently underperform single-agent baselines due to edge-level error
cascades: minor inaccuracies at one message handoff propagate across the entire
chain. We propose AgentAsk, a lightweight and plug-and-play clarification
module that treats every inter-agent message as a potential failure point and
inserts minimally necessary questions to arrest error propagation. AgentAsk
follows a three-stage pipeline: (i) distilling edge-level judgments from
curated failure traces into a compact policy, (ii) supervising the policy to
determine when/what/whom/how to ask, and (iii) optimizing online with E-GRPO, a
reinforcement learning objective that balances accuracy, latency, and cost. The
module is architecture-agnostic and easy to integrate into existing
orchestration. Across math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks, AgentAsk
consistently improves accuracy and robustness over public multi-agent
implementations while keeping overhead minimal, with latency and extra cost all
less than 5%, approaching the performance of a strong evaluator. Beyond
empirical improvements, we contribute a principled taxonomy of edge-level
errors and a practical recipe for link-local intervention, offering a scalable
pathway toward more reliable LLM-based multi-agent systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A traceable and accountable Planner-Executor-Critic pipeline for multi-agent LLM systems that improves accuracy through structured handoffs and enables error tracing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sequential multi-agent LLM systems are hard to trust because errors quietly propagate between stages without clear accountability.

Method: Evaluated eight configurations of three state-of-the-art LLMs on three benchmarks using a Planner -> Executor -> Critic pipeline with structured handoffs and saved records.

Result: Structured accountable handoffs markedly improve accuracy and prevent failures; models show clear role-specific strengths/risks; heterogeneous pipelines often most efficient for accuracy-cost-latency trade-offs.

Conclusion: Provides a practical, data-driven method for designing, tracing, and debugging reliable, predictable, and accountable multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Sequential multi-agent systems built with large language models (LLMs) can
automate complex software tasks, but they are hard to trust because errors
quietly pass from one stage to the next. We study a traceable and accountable
pipeline, meaning a system with clear roles, structured handoffs, and saved
records that let us trace who did what at each step and assign blame when
things go wrong. Our setting is a Planner -> Executor -> Critic pipeline. We
evaluate eight configurations of three state-of-the-art LLMs on three
benchmarks and analyze where errors start, how they spread, and how they can be
fixed. Our results show: (1) adding a structured, accountable handoff between
agents markedly improves accuracy and prevents the failures common in simple
pipelines; (2) models have clear role-specific strengths and risks (e.g.,
steady planning vs. high-variance critiquing), which we quantify with repair
and harm rates; and (3) accuracy-cost-latency trade-offs are task-dependent,
with heterogeneous pipelines often the most efficient. Overall, we provide a
practical, data-driven method for designing, tracing, and debugging reliable,
predictable, and accountable multi-agent systems.

*Hannah R. Lawrence,Shannon Wiltsey Stirman,Samuel Dorison,Taedong Yun,Megan Jones Bell*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that using generative AI to enhance mental health service training is a more impactful and lower-risk application than therapist chatbots, presenting a case study of veteran training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI investment and discourse focus heavily on therapist chatbots, but there's concern about risks. The authors want to highlight a safer, high-impact alternative: using generative AI for mental health service training.

Method: The paper presents a real-world case study where generative AI was used to improve training of veterans supporting each other's mental health, demonstrating practical implementation.

Result: Generative AI successfully enhanced the training process for mental health service provision, showing concrete benefits in scaling and improving training quality.

Conclusion: Investment should prioritize using generative AI to support training people in mental health service provision rather than focusing primarily on therapist chatbots, as this offers lower risk and high impact.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI) is transforming
healthcare. With this evolution comes optimism regarding the impact it will
have on mental health, as well as concern regarding the risks that come with
generative AI operating in the mental health domain. Much of the investment in,
and academic and public discourse about, AI-powered solutions for mental health
has focused on therapist chatbots. Despite the common assumption that chatbots
will be the most impactful application of GenAI to mental health, we make the
case here for a lower-risk, high impact use case: leveraging generative AI to
enhance and scale training in mental health service provision. We highlight key
benefits of using generative AI to help train people to provide mental health
services and present a real-world case study in which generative AI improved
the training of veterans to support one another's mental health. With numerous
potential applications of generative AI in mental health, we illustrate why we
should invest in using generative AI to support training people in mental
health service provision.

*Yinglun Zhu,Jiancheng Zhang,Fuzhi Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reveals that standard evaluation metrics underestimate AI models' compositional reasoning capabilities. It introduces group matching score and Test-Time Matching (TTM) algorithm to uncover hidden capabilities and achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent studies show frontier AI models struggle with compositional reasoning, performing poorly on benchmarks. The authors suspect evaluation metrics systematically underestimate model capabilities.

Method: Introduces group matching score to better exploit group structure, and proposes Test-Time Matching (TTM) - an iterative self-improving algorithm that bootstraps performance without external supervision.

Result: SigLIP-B16 surpasses all previous results and GPT-4.1, achieving first result surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground. TTM enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing new state-of-the-art with relative gains up to 85.7% on challenging datasets.

Conclusion: TTM consistently improves model performance across 16 dataset variants, advancing the frontier of compositional reasoning by revealing and leveraging hidden capabilities in AI models.

Abstract: Frontier AI models have achieved remarkable progress, yet recent studies
suggest they struggle with compositional reasoning, often performing at or
below random chance on established benchmarks. We revisit this problem and show
that widely used evaluation metrics systematically underestimate model
capability. To address this, we introduce a group matching score that better
exploits group structure and reveals substantial hidden capability in both
contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Moreover, simply overfitting to the induced group matchings at test
time transfers this hidden capability into higher scores under standard
evaluation metrics, closing much of the reported gap. This adjustment enables
SigLIP-B16 to surpass all previous results and GPT-4.1 to yield the first
result surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground.
  Building on this insight, we propose Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative,
self-improving algorithm that further bootstraps model performance without any
external supervision. TTM delivers additional, non-trivial improvements: for
example, TTM enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing a
new state of the art. Importantly, TTM remains broadly effective even on
benchmarks without metric-induced effects or group structures, achieving
relative gains up to 85.7% on challenging datasets such as WhatsUp. Across 16
dataset variants spanning diverse setups, our experiments demonstrate that TTM
consistently improves model performance and advances the frontier of
compositional reasoning.

### [146] [Safely Exploring Novel Actions in Recommender Systems via Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07635)
*Haruka Kiyohara,Yusuke Narita,Yuta Saito,Kei Tateno,Takuma Udagawa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework for safe exploration of novel actions in recommender systems that guarantees safety while enabling exploration through multiple deployments with gradually relaxed safety constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing off-policy learning methods can be unsafe when dealing with novel items that are frequently added to recommender systems, risking poor user engagement.

Method: Developed Safe Off-Policy Policy Gradient (Safe OPG) using high confidence off-policy evaluation, and a deployment-efficient framework that uses safety margins and gradually relaxes safety regularization over multiple deployments.

Result: Safe OPG almost always satisfies safety requirements while existing methods violate them, though it tends to be too conservative. The proposed framework successfully balances safety and exploration.

Conclusion: The deployment-efficient framework enables safe exploration of novel actions in recommender systems while maintaining safety guarantees, overcoming the tradeoff between safety and exploration.

Abstract: In many real recommender systems, novel items are added frequently over time.
The importance of sufficiently presenting novel actions has widely been
acknowledged for improving long-term user engagement. A recent work builds on
Off-Policy Learning (OPL), which trains a policy from only logged data,
however, the existing methods can be unsafe in the presence of novel actions.
Our goal is to develop a framework to enforce exploration of novel actions with
a guarantee for safety. To this end, we first develop Safe Off-Policy Policy
Gradient (Safe OPG), which is a model-free safe OPL method based on a high
confidence off-policy evaluation. In our first experiment, we observe that Safe
OPG almost always satisfies a safety requirement, even when existing methods
violate it greatly. However, the result also reveals that Safe OPG tends to be
too conservative, suggesting a difficult tradeoff between guaranteeing safety
and exploring novel actions. To overcome this tradeoff, we also propose a novel
framework called Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning for Safe User
Exploration, which leverages safety margin and gradually relaxes safety
regularization during multiple (not many) deployments. Our framework thus
enables exploration of novel actions while guaranteeing safe implementation of
recommender systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A simulation framework evaluates generative agents' safety, coherence, and trust in multimodal environments, revealing limitations in aligning local revisions with global safety and a tendency to overtrust misleading visuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether generative agents can be trusted in multimodal environments, as their ability to reason about safety, coherence, and trust across modalities remains limited despite advances in large language and vision-language models.

Method: A reproducible simulation framework with layered memory, dynamic planning, multimodal perception, and SocialMetrics (behavioral and structural metrics) to evaluate agents along safety improvement, unsafe activity detection, and social dynamics dimensions.

Result: Agents achieved only 55% success in correcting unsafe plans, with unsafe-to-safe conversion rates of 75%, 55%, and 58% for Claude, GPT-4o mini, and Qwen-VL respectively. 45% of unsafe actions were accepted with misleading visuals, showing strong overtrust of images.

Conclusion: Current agent architectures have critical limitations in multimodal safety and coherence, particularly in aligning local revisions with global safety and resisting misleading visuals, providing a platform for studying these issues.

Abstract: Can generative agents be trusted in multimodal environments? Despite advances
in large language and vision-language models that enable agents to act
autonomously and pursue goals in rich settings, their ability to reason about
safety, coherence, and trust across modalities remains limited. We introduce a
reproducible simulation framework for evaluating agents along three dimensions:
(1) safety improvement over time, including iterative plan revisions in
text-visual scenarios; (2) detection of unsafe activities across multiple
categories of social situations; and (3) social dynamics, measured as
interaction counts and acceptance ratios of social exchanges. Agents are
equipped with layered memory, dynamic planning, multimodal perception, and are
instrumented with SocialMetrics, a suite of behavioral and structural metrics
that quantifies plan revisions, unsafe-to-safe conversions, and information
diffusion across networks. Experiments show that while agents can detect direct
multimodal contradictions, they often fail to align local revisions with global
safety, reaching only a 55 percent success rate in correcting unsafe plans.
Across eight simulation runs with three models - Claude, GPT-4o mini, and
Qwen-VL - five agents achieved average unsafe-to-safe conversion rates of 75,
55, and 58 percent, respectively. Overall performance ranged from 20 percent in
multi-risk scenarios with GPT-4o mini to 98 percent in localized contexts such
as fire/heat with Claude. Notably, 45 percent of unsafe actions were accepted
when paired with misleading visuals, showing a strong tendency to overtrust
images. These findings expose critical limitations in current architectures and
provide a reproducible platform for studying multimodal safety, coherence, and
social dynamics.

*Xiaochen Tang,Zhenya Zhang,Miaomiao Zhang,Jie An*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes an online reward generation method for reinforcement learning using signal temporal logic (STL) causation monitoring to provide instantaneous rewards that reflect local state dynamics, overcoming sparse global reward issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing STL-based RL methods use sparse global rewards that don't accumulate local changes accurately, leading to non-convergence and unstable training in cyber-physical systems.

Method: Online reward generation guided by STL causation monitoring, computing quantitative distance toward satisfaction/violation at each control step, with smooth approximation for differentiability in deep-RL.

Result: Experimental evaluation in Gym environment shows the method outperforms existing STL-guided RL approaches, providing more robust and efficient reward generation.

Conclusion: The proposed STL-guided RL with online causation semantics offers a superior framework for control synthesis in cyber-physical systems with real-time constraints.

Abstract: In real-time and safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPSs), control
synthesis must guarantee that generated policies meet stringent timing and
correctness requirements under uncertain and dynamic conditions. Signal
temporal logic (STL) has emerged as a powerful formalism of expressing
real-time constraints, with its semantics enabling quantitative assessment of
system behavior. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning (RL) has become an important
method for solving control synthesis problems in unknown environments. Recent
studies incorporate STL-based reward functions into RL to automatically
synthesize control policies. However, the automatically inferred rewards
obtained by these methods represent the global assessment of a whole or partial
path but do not accumulate the rewards of local changes accurately, so the
sparse global rewards may lead to non-convergence and unstable training
performances. In this paper, we propose an online reward generation method
guided by the online causation monitoring of STL. Our approach continuously
monitors system behavior against an STL specification at each control step,
computing the quantitative distance toward satisfaction or violation and
thereby producing rewards that reflect instantaneous state dynamics.
Additionally, we provide a smooth approximation of the causation semantics to
overcome the discontinuity of the causation semantics and make it
differentiable for using deep-RL methods. We have implemented a prototype tool
and evaluated it in the Gym environment on a variety of continuously controlled
benchmarks. Experimental results show that our proposed STL-guided RL method
with online causation semantics outperforms existing relevant STL-guided RL
methods, providing a more robust and efficient reward generation framework for
deep-RL.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces oMeBench, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating organic reaction mechanism reasoning in LLMs, and shows current models struggle with multi-step chemical reasoning despite promising chemical intuition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLMs possess genuine chemical reasoning capabilities for organic reaction mechanisms, including generating valid intermediates, maintaining chemical consistency, and following coherent multi-step pathways.

Method: Developed oMeBench with over 10,000 expert-curated mechanistic steps, and proposed oMeS evaluation framework combining step-level logic and chemical similarity for fine-grained scoring of LLM performance.

Result: Current LLMs show promising chemical intuition but struggle with correct and consistent multi-step reasoning. Prompting strategies and fine-tuning on the dataset improved performance by 50% over leading closed-source models.

Conclusion: oMeBench provides a rigorous foundation for advancing AI systems toward genuine chemical reasoning, highlighting the need for improved multi-step reasoning capabilities in chemical AI applications.

Abstract: Organic reaction mechanisms are the stepwise elementary reactions by which
reactants form intermediates and products, and are fundamental to understanding
chemical reactivity and designing new molecules and reactions. Although large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding chemical tasks such
as synthesis design, it is unclear to what extent this reflects genuine
chemical reasoning capabilities, i.e., the ability to generate valid
intermediates, maintain chemical consistency, and follow logically coherent
multi-step pathways. We address this by introducing oMeBench, the first
large-scale, expert-curated benchmark for organic mechanism reasoning in
organic chemistry. It comprises over 10,000 annotated mechanistic steps with
intermediates, type labels, and difficulty ratings. Furthermore, to evaluate
LLM capability more precisely and enable fine-grained scoring, we propose oMeS,
a dynamic evaluation framework that combines step-level logic and chemical
similarity. We analyze the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, and our
results show that although current models display promising chemical intuition,
they struggle with correct and consistent multi-step reasoning. Notably, we
find that using prompting strategy and fine-tuning a specialist model on our
proposed dataset increases performance by 50% over the leading closed-source
model. We hope that oMeBench will serve as a rigorous foundation for advancing
AI systems toward genuine chemical reasoning.

*Minh-Anh Nguye,Minh-Duc Nguyen,Nguyen Thi Ha Lan,Kieu Hai Dang,Nguyen Tien Dong,Le Duy Dung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SurveyG is an LLM-based agent framework that uses hierarchical citation graphs to generate more structured and comprehensive survey papers by capturing research evolution and relationships between papers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based survey generation methods overlook structural relationships among papers, resulting in surveys that lack coherent taxonomy and deeper contextual understanding of research progress.

Method: Proposes SurveyG framework that integrates hierarchical citation graphs with three layers (Foundation, Development, Frontier), combines horizontal search and vertical traversal, and uses multi-agent validation for consistency and accuracy.

Result: Experiments show SurveyG outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks, producing surveys that are more comprehensive and better structured according to the field's knowledge taxonomy.

Conclusion: SurveyG successfully addresses limitations of existing methods by incorporating structural and contextual knowledge through hierarchical citation graphs, enabling generation of higher-quality survey papers.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for automating survey
paper generation \cite{wang2406autosurvey, liang2025surveyx,
yan2025surveyforge,su2025benchmarking,wen2025interactivesurvey}. Existing
approaches typically extract content from a large collection of related papers
and prompt LLMs to summarize them directly. However, such methods often
overlook the structural relationships among papers, resulting in generated
surveys that lack a coherent taxonomy and a deeper contextual understanding of
research progress. To address these shortcomings, we propose \textbf{SurveyG},
an LLM-based agent framework that integrates \textit{hierarchical citation
graph}, where nodes denote research papers and edges capture both citation
dependencies and semantic relatedness between their contents, thereby embedding
structural and contextual knowledge into the survey generation process. The
graph is organized into three layers: \textbf{Foundation},
\textbf{Development}, and \textbf{Frontier}, to capture the evolution of
research from seminal works to incremental advances and emerging directions. By
combining horizontal search within layers and vertical depth traversal across
layers, the agent produces multi-level summaries, which are consolidated into a
structured survey outline. A multi-agent validation stage then ensures
consistency, coverage, and factual accuracy in generating the final survey.
Experiments, including evaluations by human experts and LLM-as-a-judge,
demonstrate that SurveyG outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks, producing
surveys that are more comprehensive and better structured to the underlying
knowledge taxonomy of a field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show promise in medicine but are prone to factual and logical errors, which is unacceptable in high-stakes medical applications.

Method: MMIA recursively breaks down complex medical tasks into atomic, evidence-based steps and automatically audits the reasoning chain for logical coherence. It features a bootstrapping mode that stores validated reasoning chains as theorems for efficient RAG-based problem solving.

Result: MMIA achieved an error detection rate exceeding 98% with false positive rate below 1%, significantly outperforming baseline LLMs. The RAG matching mode is projected to reduce processing costs by approximately 85%.

Conclusion: MMIA's verifiable reasoning framework is a significant step toward creating trustworthy, transparent, and cost-effective AI systems for critical medical applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in medicine but are prone to
factual and logical errors, which is unacceptable in this high-stakes field. To
address this, we introduce the "Haibu Mathematical-Medical Intelligent Agent"

verifiable reasoning process. MMIA recursively breaks down complex medical
tasks into atomic, evidence-based steps. This entire reasoning chain is then
automatically audited for logical coherence and evidence traceability, similar
to theorem proving. A key innovation is MMIA's "bootstrapping" mode, which
stores validated reasoning chains as "theorems." Subsequent tasks can then be
efficiently solved using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), shifting from
costly first-principles reasoning to a low-cost verification model. We
validated MMIA across four healthcare administration domains, including DRG/DIP
audits and medical insurance adjudication, using expert-validated benchmarks.
Results showed MMIA achieved an error detection rate exceeding 98% with a false
positive rate below 1%, significantly outperforming baseline LLMs. Furthermore,
the RAG matching mode is projected to reduce average processing costs by
approximately 85% as the knowledge base matures. In conclusion, MMIA's
verifiable reasoning framework is a significant step toward creating
trustworthy, transparent, and cost-effective AI systems, making LLM technology
viable for critical applications in medicine.

### [152] [From Noisy to Native: LLM-driven Graph Restoration for Test-Time Graph Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07762)
*Xiangwei Lv,JinLuan Yang,Wang Lin,Jingyuan Chen,Beishui Liao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GRAIL is a novel framework that reframes Test-Time Graph Domain Adaptation (TT-GDA) as a generative graph restoration problem using LLMs, addressing source domain unavailability by restoring target graphs to source-domain-like states through diffusion modeling and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph domain adaptation methods rely on source-domain data, which is often unavailable due to privacy/security concerns. This drives the need for Test-Time Graph Domain Adaptation (TT-GDA) that can transfer knowledge without accessing source examples.

Method: Proposes GRAIL framework: compresses node representations into latent features, uses graph diffusion to model restoration process, quantizes features into discrete tokens, fine-tunes LLM as generative restorer, and employs reinforcement learning with alignment/confidence rewards.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach across various datasets, showing successful restoration of target graphs to source-domain-like states without accessing source data.

Conclusion: The proposed GRAIL framework successfully addresses TT-GDA by reframing it as a generative graph restoration problem, leveraging LLMs and reinforcement learning to achieve effective domain adaptation without source data access.

Abstract: Graph domain adaptation (GDA) has achieved great attention due to its
effectiveness in addressing the domain shift between train and test data. A
significant bottleneck in existing graph domain adaptation methods is their
reliance on source-domain data, which is often unavailable due to privacy or
security concerns. This limitation has driven the development of Test-Time
Graph Domain Adaptation (TT-GDA), which aims to transfer knowledge without
accessing the source examples. Inspired by the generative power of large
language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework that reframes TT-GDA as
a generative graph restoration problem, "restoring the target graph to its
pristine, source-domain-like state". There are two key challenges: (1) We need
to construct a reasonable graph restoration process and design an effective
encoding scheme that an LLM can understand, bridging the modality gap. (2) We
need to devise a mechanism to ensure the restored graph acquires the intrinsic
features of the source domain, even without access to the source data. To
ensure the effectiveness of graph restoration, we propose GRAIL, that restores
the target graph into a state that is well-aligned with the source domain.
Specifically, we first compress the node representations into compact latent
features and then use a graph diffusion process to model the graph restoration
process. Then a quantization module encodes the restored features into discrete
tokens. Building on this, an LLM is fine-tuned as a generative restorer to
transform a "noisy" target graph into a "native" one. To further improve
restoration quality, we introduce a reinforcement learning process guided by
specialized alignment and confidence rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach across various datasets.

*Tianle Zhou,Jiakai Xu,Guanhong Liu,Jiaxiang Liu,Haonan Wang,Eugene Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ACONIC is a systematic decomposition framework that models tasks as constraint problems and uses formal complexity measures to guide decomposition, improving LLM performance by 10-40 percentage points on combinatorial and database querying tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs suffer from reliability issues on complex tasks because existing decomposition methods are heuristic and rely on agent or manual decomposition, lacking systematic approaches.

Method: The paper introduces ACONIC (Analysis of CONstraint-Induced Complexity), which models tasks as constraint problems and leverages formal complexity measures to guide systematic decomposition.

Result: On combinatorial tasks (SATBench) and LLM database querying tasks (Spider), decomposition guided by complexity measures improved agent performance by 10-40 percentage points.

Conclusion: Systematic decomposition using formal complexity measures through the ACONIC framework significantly enhances LLM reliability and performance on complex tasks compared to heuristic decomposition methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from reliability issues on complex tasks,
as existing decomposition methods are heuristic and rely on agent or manual
decomposition. This work introduces a novel, systematic decomposition framework
that we call Analysis of CONstraint-Induced Complexity (ACONIC), which models
the task as a constraint problem and leveraging formal complexity measures to
guide decomposition. On combinatorial (SATBench) and LLM database querying
tasks (Spider), we find that by decomposing the tasks following the measure of
complexity, agent can perform considerably better (10-40 percentage point).

### [154] [GCPO: When Contrast Fails, Go Gold](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07790)
*Hao Wu,Wei Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GCPO introduces external reference answers to overcome GRPO's limitation of being constrained by the model's own responses, enabling learning from all-correct or all-incorrect samples and improving reasoning generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation in GRPO where the model's rollout responses determine the upper bound, preventing learning from samples that are entirely correct or incorrect.

Method: Group Contrastive Policy Optimization (GCPO) incorporates external standard reference answers to provide correct responses when the model fails, guiding the model toward accurate updates and enabling emulation of reference problem-solving strategies.

Result: GCPO achieves outstanding results across multiple benchmark datasets with substantial improvements over baseline models.

Conclusion: GCPO improves training efficiency by fully utilizing every sample and enhances reasoning generalization by allowing the model to learn from external reference answers.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to enhance the reasoning
capabilities of large language models. Extending the inference limits of
smaller models has become a prominent research focus. However, algorithms such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffer from a clear drawback: the
upper bound of a model's rollout responses is entirely determined by the model
itself, preventing the acquisition of knowledge from samples that are either
all incorrect or all correct. In this paper, we introduce Group Contrastive
Policy Optimization (GCPO), a method that incorporates external standard
reference answers. When the model cannot solve a problem, the reference answer
supplies the correct response, steering the model toward an unequivocally
accurate update direction. This approach offers two main advantages: (1) it
improves training efficiency by fully utilizing every sample; (2) it enables
the model to emulate the problem solving strategy of the reference answer
during training, thereby enhancing generalization in reasoning. GCPO achieves
outstanding results across multiple benchmark datasets, yielding substantial
improvements over the baseline model. Our code is available at:

*Valerio La Gatta,Dolev Mutzari,Sarit Kraus,VS Subrahmanian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SHADOW is a reinforcement learning framework that enables pursuer agents to balance communication for information gathering against the risk of exposure in adversarial pursuit-evasion scenarios, achieving superior performance through integrated navigation control, strategic communication, and opponent modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fundamental trade-off in adversarial environments where acquiring information through communication enhances situational awareness but simultaneously exposes agents to threats by revealing their location.

Method: Proposed SHADOW framework using multi-headed sequential reinforcement learning that integrates continuous navigation control, discrete communication actions, and opponent modeling for behavior prediction in the PEEC game formulation.

Result: SHADOW pursuers achieved higher success rates than six competitive baselines, with ablation studies confirming that temporal sequence modeling and opponent modeling are critical for effective decision-making.

Conclusion: The learned policies generalize well across varying communication risks and physical asymmetries between agents, demonstrating robust performance in balancing observability and risk in adversarial pursuit-evasion scenarios.

Abstract: Adversarial environments require agents to navigate a key strategic
trade-off: acquiring information enhances situational awareness, but may
simultaneously expose them to threats. To investigate this tension, we
formulate a PursuitEvasion-Exposure-Concealment Game (PEEC) in which a pursuer
agent must decide when to communicate in order to obtain the evader's position.
Each communication reveals the pursuer's location, increasing the risk of being
targeted. Both agents learn their movement policies via reinforcement learning,
while the pursuer additionally learns a communication policy that balances
observability and risk. We propose SHADOW (Strategic-communication Hybrid
Action Decision-making under partial Observation for Warfare), a multi-headed
sequential reinforcement learning framework that integrates continuous
navigation control, discrete communication actions, and opponent modeling for
behavior prediction. Empirical evaluations show that SHADOW pursuers achieve
higher success rates than six competitive baselines. Our ablation study
confirms that temporal sequence modeling and opponent modeling are critical for
effective decision-making. Finally, our sensitivity analysis reveals that the
learned policies generalize well across varying communication risks and
physical asymmetries between agents.

*Yuping Zhou,Siqi Lai,Jindong Han,Hao Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CityNav is a hierarchical LLM-powered framework for large-scale multi-vehicle navigation that coordinates global traffic allocation with local route planning to improve city-wide traffic efficiency and reduce congestion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing path search algorithms and reinforcement learning methods struggle to scale to city-wide networks and fail to capture the nonlinear, stochastic, and coupled dynamics of urban traffic in multi-vehicle navigation scenarios.

Method: A hierarchical framework with a global traffic allocation agent coordinating strategic traffic flow distribution across regions, and local navigation agents generating adaptive routes. Uses cooperative reasoning optimization with dual-reward structure (individual efficiency rewards + shared coordination rewards).

Result: Outperforms nine classical path search and RL-based baselines across four real-world road networks (up to 1.6M roads and 430K intersections) in city-scale travel efficiency and congestion mitigation.

Conclusion: LLMs enable scalable, adaptive, and cooperative city-wide traffic navigation, providing a foundation for intelligent large-scale vehicle routing in complex urban environments.

Abstract: The rise of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technologies is transforming traffic
management from isolated control to a collective, multi-vehicle process. At the
heart of this shift is multi-vehicle dynamic navigation, which requires
simultaneously routing large fleets under evolving traffic conditions. Existing
path search algorithms and reinforcement learning methods struggle to scale to
city-wide networks, often failing to capture the nonlinear, stochastic, and
coupled dynamics of urban traffic. To address these challenges, we propose
CityNav, a hierarchical, LLM-powered framework for large-scale multi-vehicle
navigation. CityNav integrates a global traffic allocation agent, which
coordinates strategic traffic flow distribution across regions, with local
navigation agents that generate locally adaptive routes aligned with global
directives. To enable effective cooperation, we introduce a cooperative
reasoning optimization mechanism, in which agents are jointly trained with a
dual-reward structure: individual rewards promote per-vehicle efficiency, while
shared rewards encourage network-wide coordination and congestion reduction.
Extensive experiments on four real-world road networks of varying scales (up to
1.6 million roads and 430,000 intersections) and traffic datasets demonstrate
that CityNav consistently outperforms nine classical path search and RL-based
baselines in city-scale travel efficiency and congestion mitigation. Our
results highlight the potential of LLMs to enable scalable, adaptive, and
cooperative city-wide traffic navigation, providing a foundation for
intelligent, large-scale vehicle routing in complex urban environments. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based time series forecasting approaches have limitations including marginalized roles in model architectures, reliance on coarse statistical text prompts, and lack of interpretability.

Method: Two-stage teacher-student architecture: a powerful teacher LLM infers directed causal graphs using heuristic search and pairwise causality testing, then a lightweight student agent refines the graph and fine-tunes on high-confidence causal associations encoded as rich textual prompts.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets with 25 baselines show that Augur achieves competitive performance and robust zero-shot generalization.

Conclusion: Augur provides improved predictive accuracy while yielding transparent, traceable reasoning about variable interactions through its causal reasoning approach.

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) have emerged as a promising avenue for time
series forecasting, offering the potential to integrate multimodal data.
However, existing LLM-based approaches face notable limitations-such as
marginalized role in model architectures, reliance on coarse statistical text
prompts, and lack of interpretability. In this work, we introduce Augur, a
fully LLM driven time series forecasting framework that exploits LLM causal
reasoning to discover and use directed causal associations among covariates.
Augur uses a two stage teacher student architecture where a powerful teacher
LLM infers a directed causal graph from time series using heuristic search
together with pairwise causality testing. A lightweight student agent then
refines the graph and fine tune on high confidence causal associations that are
encoded as rich textual prompts to perform forecasting. This design improves
predictive accuracy while yielding transparent, traceable reasoning about
variable interactions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets with 25
baselines demonstrate that Augur achieves competitive performance and robust
zero-shot generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to properly evaluate DeepResearch systems because they focus on isolated capabilities rather than holistic performance in open-ended research scenarios where systems must synthesize diverse sources and generate insights.

Method: The framework systematically measures three dimensions (quality, redundancy, factuality) using LLM-as-a-Judge methodology, and includes a standardized benchmark of 100 curated queries across 12 real-world categories.

Result: Evaluation of four leading commercial systems revealed distinct design philosophies and performance trade-offs, providing foundational insights about DeepResearch capabilities.

Conclusion: DeepResearch-ReportEval addresses the critical evaluation gap for DeepResearch systems as they evolve from information assistants toward intelligent research partners, with code and data publicly available.

Abstract: DeepResearch agents represent a transformative AI paradigm, conducting
expert-level research through sophisticated reasoning and multi-tool
integration. However, evaluating these systems remains critically challenging
due to open-ended research scenarios and existing benchmarks that focus on
isolated capabilities rather than holistic performance. Unlike traditional LLM
tasks, DeepResearch systems must synthesize diverse sources, generate insights,
and present coherent findings, which are capabilities that resist simple
verification. To address this gap, we introduce DeepResearch-ReportEval, a
comprehensive framework designed to assess DeepResearch systems through their
most representative outputs: research reports. Our approach systematically
measures three dimensions: quality, redundancy, and factuality, using an
innovative LLM-as-a-Judge methodology achieving strong expert concordance. We
contribute a standardized benchmark of 100 curated queries spanning 12
real-world categories, enabling systematic capability comparison. Our
evaluation of four leading commercial systems reveals distinct design
philosophies and performance trade-offs, establishing foundational insights as
DeepResearch evolves from information assistants toward intelligent research

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes 'meaningful transparency' for civic AI systems, addressing limitations of current technical transparency approaches by combining human-centric and socio-technical perspectives to enable public engagement and actionable understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI transparency practices focus on technical representations that are difficult for publics to understand, lack connection to action, and ignore socio-material contexts, limiting public agency in civic AI decision-making.

Method: Builds on human-centric AI transparency approaches combined with socio-technical systems view to develop the concept of meaningful transparency for civic AI systems.

Result: Developed a framework for meaningful transparency that allows publics to engage with AI systems affecting their lives by connecting understanding with potential for action.

Conclusion: Meaningful transparency addresses the limitations of current AI transparency practices by enabling public engagement and actionable understanding in civic AI systems.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has become a part of the provision of governmental
services, from making decisions about benefits to issuing fines for parking
violations. However, AI systems rarely live up to the promise of neutral
optimisation, creating biased or incorrect outputs and reducing the agency of
both citizens and civic workers to shape the way decisions are made.
Transparency is a principle that can both help subjects understand decisions
made about them and shape the processes behind those decisions. However,
transparency as practiced around AI systems tends to focus on the production of
technical objects that represent algorithmic aspects of decision making. These
are often difficult for publics to understand, do not connect to potential for
action, and do not give insight into the wider socio-material context of
decision making. In this paper, we build on existing approaches that take a
human-centric view on AI transparency, combined with a socio-technical systems
view, to develop the concept of meaningful transparency for civic AI systems:
transparencies that allow publics to engage with AI systems that affect their
lives, connecting understanding with potential for action.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the 'profit mirage' in LLM-based financial agents caused by information leakage, introduces FinLake-Bench for robust evaluation, and proposes FactFin framework using counterfactual perturbations to improve causal learning and out-of-sample performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based financial agents show impressive back-tested returns but suffer from 'profit mirage' where performance evaporates after the model's knowledge window ends due to inherent information leakage in LLMs.

Method: FactFin framework applies counterfactual perturbations to compel LLM-based agents to learn causal drivers instead of memorized outcomes. It integrates Strategy Code Generator, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Monte Carlo Tree Search, and Counterfactual Simulator.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method surpasses all baselines in out-of-sample generalization, delivering superior risk-adjusted performance.

Conclusion: The proposed FactFin framework effectively mitigates information leakage in LLM-based financial agents and enables better causal learning for improved out-of-sample trading performance.

Abstract: LLM-based financial agents have attracted widespread excitement for their
ability to trade like human experts. However, most systems exhibit a "profit
mirage": dazzling back-tested returns evaporate once the model's knowledge
window ends, because of the inherent information leakage in LLMs. In this
paper, we systematically quantify this leakage issue across four dimensions and
release FinLake-Bench, a leakage-robust evaluation benchmark. Furthermore, to
mitigate this issue, we introduce FactFin, a framework that applies
counterfactual perturbations to compel LLM-based agents to learn causal drivers
instead of memorized outcomes. FactFin integrates four core components:
Strategy Code Generator, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Monte Carlo Tree
Search, and Counterfactual Simulator. Extensive experiments show that our
method surpasses all baselines in out-of-sample generalization, delivering
superior risk-adjusted performance.

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework for personalized LLM-based AI agents that integrates persistent memory, dynamic coordination, self-validation, and evolving user profiles to enable adaptive long-term interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based agents lack effective personalization mechanisms, and while Retrieval Augmented Generation improves context-awareness, it doesn't combine contextual information with user-specific data. Existing personalization research remains largely conceptual with limited technical implementation.

Method: Built on a unified definition of personalization, the framework integrates established agentic AI patterns (multi-agent collaboration, multi-source retrieval) with persistent memory, dynamic coordination, self-validation, and evolving user profiles.

Result: Evaluation on three public datasets using metrics like retrieval accuracy, response correctness, and BertScore, plus a five-day pilot user study showing early indications of improved perceived personalization.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of integrating persistent memory and user profiles to improve adaptivity and perceived personalization of LLM-based agents, providing guidance for future work.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as the central control unit
of AI agents, yet current approaches remain limited in their ability to deliver
personalized interactions. While Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances LLM
capabilities by improving context-awareness, it lacks mechanisms to combine
contextual information with user-specific data. Although personalization has
been studied in fields such as human-computer interaction or cognitive science,
existing perspectives largely remain conceptual, with limited focus on
technical implementation. To address these gaps, we build on a unified
definition of personalization as a conceptual foundation to derive technical
requirements for adaptive, user-centered LLM-based agents. Combined with
established agentic AI patterns such as multi-agent collaboration or
multi-source retrieval, we present a framework that integrates persistent
memory, dynamic coordination, self-validation, and evolving user profiles to
enable personalized long-term interactions. We evaluate our approach on three
public datasets using metrics such as retrieval accuracy, response correctness,
or BertScore. We complement these results with a five-day pilot user study
providing initial insights into user feedback on perceived personalization. The
study provides early indications that guide future work and highlights the
potential of integrating persistent memory and user profiles to improve the
adaptivity and perceived personalization of LLM-based agents.

TL;DR: TaoSR-SHE is a reinforcement learning framework that uses stepwise rewards to improve query-product relevance analysis in e-commerce search, addressing limitations of existing methods like SFT, DPO, and RLVR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training paradigms (SFT, DPO, RLVR) have poor generalization on long-tail queries, lack fine-grained supervision for stepwise reasoning, and suffer from sparse feedback that undermines logical consistency in complex inference scenarios.

Method: Stepwise Hybrid Examination Reinforcement Learning (TaoSR-SHE) with Stepwise Reward Policy Optimization (SRPO) that uses step-level rewards from a hybrid generative model and human-annotated verifier, plus diversified data filtering and multi-stage curriculum learning.

Result: Extensive experiments show TaoSR-SHE improves reasoning quality and relevance-prediction accuracy in large-scale e-commerce settings, outperforming SFT, DPO, GRPO and other baselines.

Conclusion: TaoSR-SHE enhances both interpretability and robustness in e-commerce search relevance analysis while achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Query-product relevance analysis is a foundational technology in e-commerce
search engines and has become increasingly important in AI-driven e-commerce.
The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities, offers promising opportunities
for developing relevance systems that are both more interpretable and more
robust. However, existing training paradigms have notable limitations: SFT and
DPO suffer from poor generalization on long-tail queries and from a lack of
fine-grained, stepwise supervision to enforce rule-aligned reasoning. In
contrast, reinforcement learning with verification rewards (RLVR) suffers from
sparse feedback, which provides insufficient signal to correct erroneous
intermediate steps, thereby undermining logical consistency and limiting
performance in complex inference scenarios.
  To address these challenges, we introduce the Stepwise Hybrid Examination
Reinforcement Learning framework for Taobao Search Relevance (TaoSR-SHE). At
its core is Stepwise Reward Policy Optimization (SRPO), a reinforcement
learning algorithm that leverages step-level rewards generated by a hybrid of a
high-quality generative stepwise reward model and a human-annotated offline
verifier, prioritizing learning from critical correct and incorrect reasoning
steps. TaoSR-SHE further incorporates two key techniques: diversified data
filtering to encourage exploration across varied reasoning paths and mitigate
policy entropy collapse, and multi-stage curriculum learning to foster
progressive capability growth. Extensive experiments on real-world search
benchmarks show that TaoSR-SHE improves both reasoning quality and
relevance-prediction accuracy in large-scale e-commerce settings, outperforming
SFT, DPO, GRPO, and other baselines, while also enhancing interpretability and
robustness.

Motivation: Existing speech benchmarks focus on isolated capabilities like transcription or QA, lacking systematic evaluation of agentic scenarios with multilingual/cultural understanding and adversarial robustness.

Method: Created VoiceAgentBench with 5,500+ synthetic spoken queries including Indian context dialogues, supporting English, Hindi and 5 other Indian languages. Used novel sampling algorithm for TTS voice conversion to maximize acoustic and speaker diversity.

Result: Experiments revealed significant gaps in contextual tool orchestration tasks, Indic language generalization, and adversarial robustness, exposing critical limitations of current SpeechLMs.

Conclusion: The benchmark successfully identifies major weaknesses in current SpeechLMs and provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating spoken agent capabilities in realistic multilingual and culturally diverse settings.

Abstract: Large-scale Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) have enabled voice assistants
capable of understanding natural spoken queries and performing complex tasks.
However, existing speech benchmarks primarily focus on isolated capabilities
such as transcription, or question-answering, and do not systematically
evaluate agentic scenarios encompassing multilingual and cultural
understanding, as well as adversarial robustness. To address this, we introduce
VoiceAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate SpeechLMs in
realistic spoken agentic settings. It comprises over 5,500 synthetic spoken
queries, including dialogues grounded in Indian context, covering single-tool
invocations, multi-tool workflows, multi-turn interactions, and safety
evaluations. The benchmark supports English, Hindi, and 5 other Indian
languages, reflecting real-world linguistic and cultural diversity. We simulate
speaker variability using a novel sampling algorithm that selects audios for
TTS voice conversion based on its speaker embeddings, maximizing acoustic and
speaker diversity. Our evaluation measures tool selection accuracy, structural
consistency, and the correctness of tool invocations, including adversarial
robustness. Our experiments reveal significant gaps in contextual tool
orchestration tasks, Indic generalization, and adversarial robustness, exposing
critical limitations of current SpeechLMs.

TL;DR: ReInAgent is a context-aware multi-agent framework for mobile GUI agents that enables human-in-the-loop task navigation to address information dilemmas like ambiguous, dynamic, and conflicting task scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mobile GUI agents focus on autonomous operation but neglect user engagement, leading to poor adaptability in complex scenarios and outcomes that don't align with user preferences.

Method: Uses three specialized agents around a shared memory module: information-managing agent for slot-based management and user interaction, decision-making agent for conflict-aware planning, and reflecting agent for task reflection and consistency validation.

Result: Achieves 25% higher success rate than Mobile-Agent-v2 on complex tasks involving information dilemmas, producing outcomes more closely aligned with genuine user preferences.

Conclusion: ReInAgent overcomes limitations of existing approaches by enabling continuous contextual analysis and sustained user-agent collaboration for more adaptive and reliable mobile task navigation in complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents exhibit substantial potential to facilitate and automate
the execution of user tasks on mobile phones. However, exist mobile GUI agents
predominantly privilege autonomous operation and neglect the necessity of
active user engagement during task execution. This omission undermines their
adaptability to information dilemmas including ambiguous, dynamically evolving,
and conflicting task scenarios, leading to execution outcomes that deviate from
genuine user requirements and preferences. To address these shortcomings, we
propose ReInAgent, a context-aware multi-agent framework that leverages dynamic
information management to enable human-in-the-loop mobile task navigation.
ReInAgent integrates three specialized agents around a shared memory module: an
information-managing agent for slot-based information management and proactive
interaction with the user, a decision-making agent for conflict-aware planning,
and a reflecting agent for task reflection and information consistency
validation. Through continuous contextual information analysis and sustained
user-agent collaboration, ReInAgent overcomes the limitation of existing
approaches that rely on clear and static task assumptions. Consequently, it
enables more adaptive and reliable mobile task navigation in complex,
real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ReInAgent
effectively resolves information dilemmas and produces outcomes that are more
closely aligned with genuine user preferences. Notably, on complex tasks
involving information dilemmas, ReInAgent achieves a 25% higher success rate
than Mobile-Agent-v2.

### [167] [Language Models Do Not Embed Numbers Continuously](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08009)
*Alex O. Davies,Roussel Nzoyem,Nirav Ajmeri,Telmo M. Silva Filho*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Language models represent numeric values as non-continuous with significant noise, despite high reconstruction fidelity. Principal components explain little variation, and performance degrades with increasing decimal precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether language models actually represent continuous numeric values as continuous, rather than just being able to reconstruct them from embeddings.

Method: Used linear reconstruction and principal component analysis on embeddings from models by OpenAI, Google Gemini, and Voyage AI to evaluate continuity and noise in numeric representations.

Result: While numeric reconstruction achieved high fidelity (R² ≥ 0.95), principal components explained only minor variation, indicating many embedding components are orthogonal to numeric input space. Performance degraded with increasing decimal precision.

Conclusion: Language models represent numeric spaces non-continuously with significant noise, which has implications for applications requiring high numerical precision, large magnitudes, or mixed-sign values.

Abstract: Recent research has extensively studied how large language models manipulate
integers in specific arithmetic tasks, and on a more fundamental level, how
they represent numeric values. These previous works have found that language
model embeddings can be used to reconstruct the original values, however, they
do not evaluate whether language models actually model continuous values as
continuous. Using expected properties of the embedding space, including linear
reconstruction and principal component analysis, we show that language models
not only represent numeric spaces as non-continuous but also introduce
significant noise. Using models from three major providers (OpenAI, Google
Gemini and Voyage AI), we show that while reconstruction is possible with high
fidelity ($R^2 \geq 0.95$), principal components only explain a minor share of
variation within the embedding space. This indicates that many components
within the embedding space are orthogonal to the simple numeric input space.
Further, both linear reconstruction and explained variance suffer with
increasing decimal precision, despite the ordinal nature of the input space
being fundamentally unchanged. The findings of this work therefore have
implications for the many areas where embedding models are used, in-particular
where high numerical precision, large magnitudes or mixed-sign values are
common.

### [168] [PEAR: Phase Entropy Aware Reward for Efficient Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08026)
*Chen Huang,Wei Lu,Wenxuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PEAR introduces a phase entropy aware reward mechanism that reduces redundant reasoning steps in Large Reasoning Models by controlling entropy at different reasoning stages, achieving shorter responses while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models generate excessively long chain-of-thought explanations with redundant reasoning steps, which inflate inference costs and reduce usability. Current methods struggle to control response length without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: PEAR (Phase Entropy Aware Reward) incorporates phase-dependent entropy into reward design, penalizing excessive entropy during the thinking phase while allowing moderate exploration at the final answer phase. This enables adaptive length control without explicit targets or truncation rules.

Result: Extensive experiments across four benchmarks show PEAR consistently reduces response length while sustaining competitive accuracy across model scales. It also demonstrates strong out-of-distribution robustness beyond the training distribution.

Conclusion: Phase-dependent entropy serves as an effective control knob for balancing conciseness and performance in reasoning models, enabling adaptive length control without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks by generating detailed chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations.
However, these responses are often excessively long, containing redundant
reasoning steps that inflate inference cost and reduce usability. Controlling
the length of generated reasoning without sacrificing accuracy remains an open
challenge. Through a systematic empirical analysis, we reveal a consistent
positive correlation between model entropy and response length at different
reasoning stages across diverse LRMs: the thinking phase exhibits higher
entropy, reflecting exploratory behavior of longer responses, while the final
answer phase shows lower entropy, indicating a more deterministic solution.This
observation suggests that entropy at different reasoning stages can serve as a
control knob for balancing conciseness and performance. Based on this insight,
this paper introduces Phase Entropy Aware Reward (PEAR), a reward mechanism
that incorporating phase-dependent entropy into the reward design. Instead of
treating all tokens uniformly, PEAR penalize excessive entropy during the
thinking phase and allowing moderate exploration at the final answer phase,
which encourages models to generate concise reasoning traces that retain
sufficient flexibility to solve the task correctly. This enables adaptive
control of response length without relying on explicit length targets or rigid
truncation rules. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that
PEAR consistently reduces response length while sustaining competitive accuracy
across model scales. In addition, PEAR demonstrates strong out-of-distribution
(OOD) robustness beyond the training distribution. Our code is available at:

### [169] [AILoRA: Function-Aware Asymmetric Initialization for Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08034)
*Xiaoshuang Ji,Zhendong Zhao,Xiaoyan Gu,Xiaojun Chen,Xin Zhao,Zeyao Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AILoRA is a parameter-efficient finetuning method that uses function-aware asymmetric low-rank priors to address LoRA's limitations in performance and convergence by differently initializing Q and V projection matrices based on their distinct functional roles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA faces challenges like suboptimal performance and slow convergence despite its popularity. The authors observed that Q and V projection matrices in self-attention have different parameter characteristics due to their functional differences, suggesting that asymmetric treatment could improve LoRA.

Method: AILoRA performs function-aware initialization: injects principal components of W^Q to retain task-adaptive capacity, and minor components of W^V to preserve generalizable feature representations. This asymmetric strategy better captures the specialized roles of attention parameters.

Result: The method enhances both finetuning performance and convergence efficiency by leveraging the distinct characteristics of Q and V matrices - W^Q is task-sensitive while W^V remains stable across tasks.

Conclusion: Asymmetric treatment of Q and V projection matrices based on their functional differences significantly improves LoRA's performance and convergence, making AILoRA an effective parameter-efficient finetuning approach.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) aims to mitigate the substantial
computational and memory overhead involved in adapting large-scale pretrained
models to diverse downstream tasks. Among numerous PEFT strategies, Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most widely adopted approaches due
to its robust empirical performance and low implementation complexity. In
practical deployment, LoRA is typically applied to the $W^Q$ and $W^V$
projection matrices of self-attention modules, enabling an effective trade-off
between model performance and parameter efficiency. While LoRA has achieved
considerable empirical success, it still encounters challenges such as
suboptimal performance and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we
introduce \textbf{AILoRA}, a novel parameter-efficient method that incorporates
function-aware asymmetric low-rank priors. Our empirical analysis reveals that
the projection matrices $W^Q$ and $W^V$ in the self-attention mechanism exhibit
distinct parameter characteristics, stemming from their functional differences.
Specifically, $W^Q$ captures task-specific semantic space knowledge essential
for attention distributions computation, making its parameters highly sensitive
to downstream task variations. In contrast, $W^V$ encodes token-level feature
representations that tend to remain stable across tasks and layers. Leveraging
these insights, AILoRA performs a function-aware initialization by injecting
the principal components of $W^Q$ to retain task-adaptive capacity, and the
minor components of $W^V$ to preserve generalizable feature representations.
This asymmetric initialization strategy enables LoRA modules to better capture
the specialized roles of attention parameters, thereby enhancing both
finetuning performance and convergence efficiency.

### [170] [LinguaSim: Interactive Multi-Vehicle Testing Scenario Generation via Natural Language Instruction Based on Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08046)
*Qingyuan Shi,Qingwen Meng,Hao Cheng,Qing Xu,Jianqiang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LinguaSim is an LLM-based framework that converts natural language into realistic, interactive 3D scenarios for autonomous vehicle testing, improving command adherence and realism while enabling dynamic vehicle interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based scenario generation methods struggle to balance command adherence accuracy with realism, often compromising by using 2D or open-loop simulations with non-interactive background vehicles.

Method: Uses LLMs to convert natural language into 3D scenarios with dynamic vehicle interactions, includes a feedback calibration module to refine generation precision and align with user intent, and constrains adversarial behaviors using both scenario descriptions and autonomous driving models.

Result: Generated scenarios with varying criticality aligned with different natural language descriptions (ACT: 0.072s for dangerous vs. 3.532s for safe; comfortability: 0.654 vs. 0.764), and reduced crash rate from 46.9% to 6.3% through refinement.

Conclusion: LinguaSim bridges the gap between natural language and closed-loop interactive simulations, facilitating high-fidelity scenario creation for enhanced safety testing and training of autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: The generation of testing and training scenarios for autonomous vehicles has
drawn significant attention. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled
new scenario generation methods, current methods struggle to balance command
adherence accuracy with the realism of real-world driving environments. To
reduce scenario description complexity, these methods often compromise realism
by limiting scenarios to 2D, or open-loop simulations where background vehicles
follow predefined, non-interactive behaviors. We propose LinguaSim, an
LLM-based framework that converts natural language into realistic, interactive
3D scenarios, ensuring both dynamic vehicle interactions and faithful alignment
between the input descriptions and the generated scenarios. A feedback
calibration module further refines the generation precision, improving fidelity
to user intent. By bridging the gap between natural language and closed-loop,
interactive simulations, LinguaSim constrains adversarial vehicle behaviors
using both the scenario description and the autonomous driving model guiding
them. This framework facilitates the creation of high-fidelity scenarios that
enhance safety testing and training. Experiments show LinguaSim can generate
scenarios with varying criticality aligned with different natural language
descriptions (ACT: 0.072 s for dangerous vs. 3.532 s for safe descriptions;
comfortability: 0.654 vs. 0.764), and its refinement module effectively reduces
excessive aggressiveness in LinguaSim's initial outputs, lowering the crash
rate from 46.9% to 6.3% to better match user intentions.

### [171] [Multi-Condition Conformal Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08075)
*Qingyang Hao,Wenbo Liao,Bingyi Jing,Hongxin Wei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MCCS extends conformal selection to multi-condition scenarios with FDR control for conjunctive and disjunctive conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing conformal selection methods only work for single-threshold scenarios and cannot handle practical multi-condition selection needs in applications like drug discovery and LLM alignment.

Method: Proposes MCCS algorithm with novel nonconformity score for conjunctive conditions and global BH procedure for disjunctive conditions.

Result: Achieves finite-sample FDR control with theoretical guarantees and shows superiority over baselines across diverse condition combinations and real-world modalities.

Conclusion: MCCS enables rigorous FDR-controlled selection in various multi-condition environments with strong theoretical foundations and practical applicability.

Abstract: Selecting high-quality candidates from large-scale datasets is critically
important in resource-constrained applications such as drug discovery,
precision medicine, and the alignment of large language models. While conformal
selection methods offer a rigorous solution with False Discovery Rate (FDR)
control, their applicability is confined to single-threshold scenarios (i.e., y
> c) and overlooks practical needs for multi-condition selection, such as
conjunctive or disjunctive conditions. In this work, we propose the
Multi-Condition Conformal Selection (MCCS) algorithm, which extends conformal
selection to scenarios with multiple conditions. In particular, we introduce a
novel nonconformity score with regional monotonicity for conjunctive conditions
and a global Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure for disjunctive conditions,
thereby establishing finite-sample FDR control with theoretical guarantees. The
integration of these components enables the proposed method to achieve rigorous
FDR-controlled selection in various multi-condition environments. Extensive
experiments validate the superiority of MCCS over baselines, its
generalizability across diverse condition combinations, different real-world
modalities, and multi-task scalability.

*Xiaochong Lan,Jie Feng,Yinxing Liu,Xinlei Shi,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoQual is an LLM-based agent framework that automates discovery of interpretable features for review quality assessment, mimicking human research processes through iterative hypothesis generation and tool implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for ranking online reviews by quality are unscalable across domains and fail to adapt to evolving content patterns, while deep learning approaches lack interpretability and may prioritize semantics over actual quality.

Method: AutoQual uses an LLM-based agent framework that iteratively generates feature hypotheses through reflection, operationalizes them via autonomous tool implementation, and accumulates experience in persistent memory, mimicking human research processes.

Result: Deployed on a large-scale platform with billion-level user base, A/B testing showed AutoQual increased average reviews viewed per user by 0.79% and conversion rate of review readers by 0.27%.

Conclusion: AutoQual effectively transforms tacit knowledge into explicit, computable features for quality assessment and demonstrates practical effectiveness in real-world e-commerce applications.

Abstract: Ranking online reviews by their intrinsic quality is a critical task for
e-commerce platforms and information services, impacting user experience and
business outcomes. However, quality is a domain-dependent and dynamic concept,
making its assessment a formidable challenge. Traditional methods relying on
hand-crafted features are unscalable across domains and fail to adapt to
evolving content patterns, while modern deep learning approaches often produce
black-box models that lack interpretability and may prioritize semantics over
quality. To address these challenges, we propose AutoQual, an LLM-based agent
framework that automates the discovery of interpretable features. While
demonstrated on review quality assessment, AutoQual is designed as a general
framework for transforming tacit knowledge embedded in data into explicit,
computable features. It mimics a human research process, iteratively generating
feature hypotheses through reflection, operationalizing them via autonomous
tool implementation, and accumulating experience in a persistent memory. We
deploy our method on a large-scale online platform with a billion-level user
base. Large-scale A/B testing confirms its effectiveness, increasing average
reviews viewed per user by 0.79% and the conversion rate of review readers by
0.27%.

*Sukriti Bhattacharya,Chitro Majumdar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework for provably fair AI using ontology engineering and optimal transport to systematically remove sensitive information and proxies, ensuring complete fairness with mathematical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current bias mitigation methods have limitations in addressing all sensitive information and proxies. This work aims to overcome these limits by providing a mathematically grounded approach that guarantees true independence from biased patterns.

Method: Uses OWL 2 QL ontology engineering to define sensitive attributes and infer proxies through logical reasoning, constructs a sigma algebra G capturing biased patterns, and applies Delbaen Majumdar optimal transport to generate fair representations independent of G while preserving accuracy.

Result: The framework ensures complete fairness by removing all sensitive information and proxies, providing certifiable fairness guarantees in applications like loan approval where proxies (e.g., ZIP code revealing race) are problematic.

Conclusion: This approach offers a mathematically grounded and certifiable method for trustworthy AI that guarantees true independence from biased patterns rather than mere decorrelation, addressing fundamental limitations of current bias mitigation techniques.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for provably fair AI that overcomes the
limits of current bias mitigation methods by systematically removing all
sensitive information and its proxies. Using ontology engineering in OWL 2 QL,
it formally defines sensitive attributes and infers their proxies through
logical reasoning, constructing a sigma algebra G that captures the full
structure of biased patterns. Fair representations are then obtained via
Delbaen Majumdar optimal transport, which generates variables independent of G
while minimizing L2 distance to preserve accuracy. This guarantees true
independence rather than mere decorrelation. By modeling bias as dependence
between sigma algebras, compiling ontological knowledge into measurable
structures, and using optimal transport as the unique fair transformation, the
approach ensures complete fairness in tasks like loan approval, where proxies
such as ZIP code reveal race. The result is a certifiable and mathematically
grounded method for trustworthy AI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study examines how language models can replicate human risk preferences, focusing on gender differences, uncertainty, role-based decisions, and manipulability of risk aversion. While some models show alignment with human behavior, significant discrepancies highlight the need for better bio-centric measures and AI design improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As language models are increasingly used in decision support systems, understanding their risk behaviors is crucial for responsible AI deployment to prevent hidden biases and ensure they don't nudge users toward risky decisions.

Method: The study investigates manipulability of risk aversion (MoRA) in LMs by examining their ability to replicate human risk preferences across diverse economic scenarios, with focus on gender-specific attitudes, uncertainty, role-based decision-making, and risk aversion manipulability.

Result: LMs like DeepSeek Reasoner and Gemini-2.0-flash-lite show some alignment with human behaviors, but notable discrepancies exist that highlight the need to refine bio-centric measures of manipulability.

Conclusion: The findings suggest directions for refining AI design to better align human and AI risk preferences, enhance ethical decision-making, and improve AI systems' effectiveness in risk management contexts through more accurate replication of human risk preferences.

Abstract: Responsible AI demands systems whose behavioral tendencies can be effectively
measured, audited, and adjusted to prevent inadvertently nudging users toward
risky decisions or embedding hidden biases in risk aversion. As language models
(LMs) are increasingly incorporated into AI-driven decision support systems,
understanding their risk behaviors is crucial for their responsible deployment.
This study investigates the manipulability of risk aversion (MoRA) in LMs,
examining their ability to replicate human risk preferences across diverse
economic scenarios, with a focus on gender-specific attitudes, uncertainty,
role-based decision-making, and the manipulability of risk aversion. The
results indicate that while LMs such as DeepSeek Reasoner and
Gemini-2.0-flash-lite exhibit some alignment with human behaviors, notable
discrepancies highlight the need to refine bio-centric measures of
manipulability. These findings suggest directions for refining AI design to
better align human and AI risk preferences and enhance ethical decision-making.
The study calls for further advancements in model design to ensure that AI
systems more accurately replicate human risk preferences, thereby improving
their effectiveness in risk management contexts. This approach could enhance
the applicability of AI assistants in managing risk.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PMFR proposes a temporal decoupling framework to resolve the latency-quality tradeoff in dialogue systems through asynchronous knowledge orchestration, achieving 95.3% latency reduction while maintaining response quality comparable to synchronous baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fundamental constraint between latency and quality in open-domain dialogue systems, where lightweight models lack reasoning depth and tool-augmented agents cause prohibitive delays due to synchronous execution during knowledge retrieval.

Method: Uses three coordinated components: Knowledge Adequacy Evaluator for real-time sufficiency assessment, Lightweight Response Generator for immediate interaction, and Asynchronous Knowledge Refinement Agent for background knowledge enhancement with intelligent triggering mechanisms.

Result: Achieves 95.3% latency reduction (23.38s to 1.09s) on Top-iOCQA while preserving response quality comparable to heavyweight synchronous baselines (GEval-C: 0.613 vs. 0.620).

Conclusion: PMFR's temporal decoupling framework successfully resolves the latency-quality contradiction in dialogue systems through asynchronous knowledge orchestration, maintaining conversational flow while progressively enriching knowledge coverage.

Abstract: The latency-quality tradeoff is a fundamental constraint in open-domain
dialogue AI systems, since comprehensive knowledge access necessitates
prohibitive response delays. Contemporary approaches offer two inadequate
solutions: lightweight instruct models achieve sub-second latency but lack
reasoning depth, while tool-augmented ReAct agents enhance factuality through
external knowledge at the cost of synchronous execution that blocks interaction
during re- trieval processes. PMFR is thus proposed, with a tempo- ral
decoupling framework that fundamentally resolves the contradiction through
asynchronous knowledge orchestra- tion. PMFR employs three coordinated
components: (1) a Knowledge Adequacy Evaluator for real-time sufficiency
assessment, (2) a Lightweight Response Generator for imme- diate user
interaction, and (3) an Asynchronous Knowledge Refinement Agent for background
knowledge enhancement. This architecture maintains continuous conversational
flow while progressively enriching knowledge coverage through intelligent
triggering mechanisms. Evaluation results on Top- iOCQA demonstrate PMFR
outperforms brute-force scaling: PMFR achieves 95.3% latency reduction (23.38s
-> 1.09s) while preserving response quality comparable to heavyweight
synchronous baselines (GEval-C: 0.613 vs. 0.620).

TL;DR: R-HORIZON is a method and benchmark for evaluating and enhancing long-horizon reasoning in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) through query composition, addressing limitations in current benchmarks that focus only on single-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks fail to adequately evaluate models' ability to handle complex, long-horizon scenarios, as they mainly focus on immediate, single-horizon tasks, leaving an incomplete assessment of LRMs' reasoning capabilities.

Method: Proposed R-HORIZON method stimulates long-horizon reasoning through query composition and constructs a benchmark with complex multi-step reasoning tasks. Used R-HORIZON to create data for reinforcement learning with verified rewards (RLVR).

Result: Advanced LRMs show significant performance degradation on R-HORIZON benchmark, revealing limited effective reasoning length and poor thinking budget allocation. RLVR training with R-HORIZON data improves multi-horizon reasoning performance and boosts accuracy on standard reasoning tasks by 7.5 on AIME2024.

Conclusion: R-HORIZON provides a scalable, controllable, and low-cost paradigm for both evaluating and enhancing long-horizon reasoning capabilities in LRMs, addressing critical gaps in current reasoning model assessment.

Abstract: Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1,
DeepSeek-R1) have led to remarkable improvements through long Chain-of-Thought
(CoT). However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on immediate, single-horizon
tasks, failing to adequately evaluate models' ability to understand and respond
to complex, long-horizon scenarios. To address this incomplete evaluation of
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), we propose R-HORIZON, a method designed to
stimulate long-horizon reasoning behaviors in LRMs through query composition.
Based on R-HORIZON, we construct a long-horizon reasoning benchmark, comprising
complex multi-step reasoning tasks with interdependent problems that span long
reasoning horizons. Through comprehensive evaluation of LRMs using the
R-HORIZON benchmark, we find that even the most advanced LRMs suffer
significant performance degradation. Our analysis reveals that LRMs exhibit
limited effective reasoning length and struggle to allocate thinking budget
across multiple problems appropriately. Recognizing these limitations, we use
R-HORIZON to construct long-horizon reasoning data for reinforcement learning
with verified rewards (RLVR). Compared to training with single-horizon data,
RLVR with R-HORIZON not only substantially improves performance on the
multi-horizon reasoning tasks, but also promotes accuracy on standard reasoning
tasks, with an increase of 7.5 on AIME2024. These results position R-HORIZON as
a scalable, controllable, and low-cost paradigm for enhancing and evaluating
the long-horizon reasoning capabilities of LRMs.

*Rashid Mushkani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the AI Pluralism Index (AIPI), a transparent framework to measure how well AI systems incorporate diverse stakeholder interests across participatory governance, inclusivity, transparency, and accountability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI development is concentrated in few firms and states, risking narrow interests dominating technology design and limiting public agency. While technical benchmarks are common, there's a lack of public, auditable measures for pluralistic governance.

Method: Developed AIPI as an evidence-based instrument that evaluates AI producers and systems across four pillars. Uses verifiable practices from public artifacts, independent evaluations, and explicitly handles unknown evidence with lower-bound and known-only scoring. Includes reproducible pipeline with web analysis, external assessments, expert interviews, and reliability testing.

Result: Created a working measurement model with pilot provider results. The framework includes transparent protocol, codebook, scoring scripts, and evidence graph with versioned releases and public adjudication process.

Conclusion: AIPI aims to steer incentives toward pluralistic AI practices and provide policymakers, procurers, and the public with comparable evidence for better governance.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems increasingly mediate knowledge,
communication, and decision making. Development and governance remain
concentrated within a small set of firms and states, raising concerns that
technologies may encode narrow interests and limit public agency. Capability
benchmarks for language, vision, and coding are common, yet public, auditable
measures of pluralistic governance are rare. We define AI pluralism as the
degree to which affected stakeholders can shape objectives, data practices,
safeguards, and deployment. We present the AI Pluralism Index (AIPI), a
transparent, evidence-based instrument that evaluates producers and system
families across four pillars: participatory governance, inclusivity and
diversity, transparency, and accountability. AIPI codes verifiable practices
from public artifacts and independent evaluations, explicitly handling
"Unknown" evidence to report both lower-bound ("evidence") and known-only
scores with coverage. We formalize the measurement model; implement a
reproducible pipeline that integrates structured web and repository analysis,
external assessments, and expert interviews; and assess reliability with
inter-rater agreement, coverage reporting, cross-index correlations, and
sensitivity analysis. The protocol, codebook, scoring scripts, and evidence
graph are maintained openly with versioned releases and a public adjudication
process. We report pilot provider results and situate AIPI relative to adjacent
transparency, safety, and governance frameworks. The index aims to steer
incentives toward pluralistic practice and to equip policymakers, procurers,
and the public with comparable evidence.

*Matteo Gregorini,Chiara Boldrini,Lorenzo Valerio*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DODO is an algorithm that enables AI agents to autonomously learn causal structures through interventions, outperforming observational methods in causal graph reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI relies on correlations rather than causal understanding. Enabling causality awareness can enhance AI performance by providing deeper understanding of environmental mechanisms.

Method: An agent interacts with a world governed by a hidden causal DAG, performing interventions and using causal inference techniques to analyze statistical significance of observed changes.

Result: DODO shows better performance than observational approaches in all but the most limited resource conditions, often reconstructing causal graphs with zero errors. In challenging configurations, it outperforms the best baseline by +0.25 F1 points.

Conclusion: DODO successfully demonstrates how agents can autonomously learn causal structures through interventions, providing a foundation for causality-aware AI systems.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has achieved remarkable advancements in recent years,
yet much of its progress relies on identifying increasingly complex
correlations. Enabling causality awareness in AI has the potential to enhance
its performance by enabling a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms
of the environment. In this paper, we introduce DODO, an algorithm defining how
an Agent can autonomously learn the causal structure of its environment through
repeated interventions. We assume a scenario where an Agent interacts with a
world governed by a causal Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which dictates the
system's dynamics but remains hidden from the Agent. The Agent's task is to
accurately infer the causal DAG, even in the presence of noise. To achieve
this, the Agent performs interventions, leveraging causal inference techniques
to analyze the statistical significance of observed changes. Results show
better performance for DODO, compared to observational approaches, in all but
the most limited resource conditions. DODO is often able to reconstruct with as
low as zero errors the structure of the causal graph. In the most challenging
configuration, DODO outperforms the best baseline by +0.25 F1 points.

*Yunlong Deng,Boyang Sun,Yan Li,Lingjing Kong,Zeyu Tang,Kun Zhang,Guangyi Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes SR², a causal framework that treats reasoning as selection operations using latent logical concepts, achieving significant performance improvements with fewer parameters on reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large language models fail to perform reasoning reliably despite extensive training. The paper aims to understand reasoning tasks from a causal perspective and address their challenges by analyzing latent space behavior.

Method: SR² framework with three modules: reflective representation learning, dependency self-refinement, and periodic intermediate alignment. It incorporates estimated latent variables as feedback into the selection mechanism to learn dense dependencies among latent representations.

Result: Achieved over 10% improvement in reasoning accuracy with 8× fewer parameters on Sudoku and Maze tasks compared to recent advances.

Conclusion: The causal perspective and SR² framework effectively address reasoning challenges by modeling latent logical concepts and dependencies, leading to significant performance gains with reduced model complexity.

Abstract: Due to their inherent complexity, reasoning tasks have long been regarded as
rigorous benchmarks for assessing the capabilities of machine learning models,
especially large language models (LLMs). Although humans can solve these tasks
with ease, existing models, even after extensive pre-training and post-training
at scale, still fail to perform reasoning reliably. In this paper, we revisit
reasoning tasks from a causal perspective, seeking to understand their behavior
in latent space and to offer insights for addressing their challenges.
Specifically, we cast reasoning tasks as a selection mechanism, in which
high-level logical concepts function as selection operators on the given
observations, such as, identifying the correct answer in a math problem or
filling the appropriate entry in Sudoku. We emphasize two key properties of
this formulation that shed light on the difficulty of reasoning tasks. First,
the latent space exceeds the observation space in complexity, even when the
correct answer is fully determined by the observed input. Second, the latent
variables, corresponding to logical thought, are densely structured and exhibit
strong dependencies. Building on this formulation, we introduce a framework,
called SR$^2$, that incorporates the estimated latent variables as feedback
into the selection mechanism, thereby facilitating the learning of dense
dependencies among latent representations. The framework consists of three key
modules: reflective representation learning, dependency self-refinement, and
periodic intermediate alignment. Experimentally, we show that our approach
yields significant gains in reasoning accuracy, for example, attaining over
10$\%$ improvement in performance with 8$\times$ fewer parameters on the Sudoku
and Maze tasks over the recent advances.

### [180] [Chain-of-Trigger: An Agentic Backdoor that Paradoxically Enhances Agentic Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08238)
*Jiyang Qiu,Xinbei Ma,Yunqing Xu,Zhuosheng Zhang,Hai Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoTri is a multi-step backdoor attack for LLM agents that uses sequential triggers to divert agents from intended tasks while paradoxically improving their performance on benign tasks and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address security concerns about LLM-based agents by revealing their vulnerabilities to sophisticated backdoor attacks that can achieve long-term control.

Method: Propose Chain-of-Trigger Backdoor (CoTri) using an ordered sequence of triggers - starting with initial trigger and subsequent ones from environment - for multi-step manipulation of agent behavior.

Result: Achieves near-perfect attack success rate (99.8% ASR) with near-zero false trigger rate (0.1% FTR), while paradoxically improving agent performance on benign tasks and robustness against distractions.

Conclusion: CoTri enables stable multi-step control of agents while making attacks more stealthy by improving inherent robustness, highlighting significant safety risks in deployed LLM agents.

Abstract: The rapid deployment of large language model (LLM)-based agents in real-world
applications has raised serious concerns about their trustworthiness. In this
work, we reveal the security and robustness vulnerabilities of these agents
through backdoor attacks. Distinct from traditional backdoors limited to
single-step control, we propose the Chain-of-Trigger Backdoor (CoTri), a
multi-step backdoor attack designed for long-horizon agentic control. CoTri
relies on an ordered sequence. It starts with an initial trigger, and
subsequent ones are drawn from the environment, allowing multi-step
manipulation that diverts the agent from its intended task. Experimental
results show that CoTri achieves a near-perfect attack success rate (ASR) while
maintaining a near-zero false trigger rate (FTR). Due to training data modeling
the stochastic nature of the environment, the implantation of CoTri
paradoxically enhances the agent's performance on benign tasks and even
improves its robustness against environmental distractions. We further validate
CoTri on vision-language models (VLMs), confirming its scalability to
multimodal agents. Our work highlights that CoTri achieves stable, multi-step
control within agents, improving their inherent robustness and task
capabilities, which ultimately makes the attack more stealthy and raises
potential safty risks.

TL;DR: Co-TAP is a three-layer agent interaction protocol addressing interoperability, interaction, and knowledge sharing challenges in multi-agent systems through HAI, UAP, and MEK protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the core challenges in multi-agent systems across three dimensions: Interoperability, Interaction and Collaboration, and Knowledge Sharing.

Method: A layered protocol framework with three core protocols: Human-Agent Interaction Protocol (HAI) for standardized event-driven communication, Unified Agent Protocol (UAP) for service discovery and protocol conversion, and Memory-Extraction-Knowledge Protocol (MEK) for cognitive chain standardization.

Result: The protocol enables real-time performance, reliability, synergy in interactions, seamless interconnection of heterogeneous agents, and foundation for collective intelligence through shareable knowledge.

Conclusion: Co-TAP provides a solid engineering foundation and theoretical guidance for building efficient, scalable, and intelligent multi-agent applications.

Abstract: This paper proposes Co-TAP (T: Triple, A: Agent, P: Protocol), a three-layer
agent interaction protocol designed to address the challenges faced by
multi-agent systems across the three core dimensions of Interoperability,
Interaction and Collaboration, and Knowledge Sharing. We have designed and
proposed a layered solution composed of three core protocols: the Human-Agent
Interaction Protocol (HAI), the Unified Agent Protocol (UAP), and the
Memory-Extraction-Knowledge Protocol (MEK). HAI focuses on the interaction
layer, standardizing the flow of information between users, interfaces, and
agents by defining a standardized, event-driven communication paradigm. This
ensures the real-time performance, reliability, and synergy of interactions. As
the core of the infrastructure layer, UAP is designed to break down
communication barriers among heterogeneous agents through unified service
discovery and protocol conversion mechanisms, thereby enabling seamless
interconnection and interoperability of the underlying network. MEK, in turn,
operates at the cognitive layer. By establishing a standardized ''Memory (M) -
Extraction (E) - Knowledge (K)'' cognitive chain, it empowers agents with the
ability to learn from individual experiences and form shareable knowledge,
thereby laying the foundation for the realization of true collective
intelligence. We believe this protocol framework will provide a solid
engineering foundation and theoretical guidance for building the next
generation of efficient, scalable, and intelligent multi-agent applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Scale Equivariant Graph Metanetworks (ScaleGMNs) enable efficient amortized optimization for neural networks by exploiting scaling symmetries, allowing single-shot fine-tuning and showing better performance in CNNs than MLPs due to reduced gauge freedom.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accelerate optimization of related problems by learning mappings that exploit shared structure, reducing the need for iterative optimization through amortized approaches.

Method: Use Scale Equivariant Graph Metanetworks (ScaleGMNs) that operate directly in weight space, enabling single-shot fine-tuning of existing models by leveraging scaling symmetries.

Result: Empirical demonstration of effectiveness and theoretical finding that gauge freedom from scaling symmetries is smaller in CNNs than MLPs, explaining performance differences between architectures.

Conclusion: Symmetry-aware metanetworks show strong potential for efficient and generalizable neural network optimization, with ScaleGMNs providing a powerful approach for amortized optimization.

Abstract: Amortized optimization accelerates the solution of related optimization
problems by learning mappings that exploit shared structure across problem
instances. We explore the use of Scale Equivariant Graph Metanetworks
(ScaleGMNs) for this purpose. By operating directly in weight space, ScaleGMNs
enable single-shot fine-tuning of existing models, reducing the need for
iterative optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach
empirically and provide a theoretical result: the gauge freedom induced by
scaling symmetries is strictly smaller in convolutional neural networks than in
multi-layer perceptrons. This insight helps explain the performance differences
observed between architectures in both our work and that of Kalogeropoulos et
al. (2024). Overall, our findings underscore the potential of symmetry-aware
metanetworks as a powerful approach for efficient and generalizable neural
network optimization. Open-source code:

### [183] [First Try Matters: Revisiting the Role of Reflection in Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08308)
*Liwei Kang,Yue Deng,Yao Xiao,Zhanfeng Mo,Wee Sun Lee,Lidong Bing*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Reflections in reasoning models are mostly confirmatory and rarely change initial answers. Training with more reflection steps improves first-answer accuracy rather than correction ability. A question-aware early-stopping method reduces reasoning tokens by 24.5% with minimal accuracy drop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the actual contribution of reflections in reasoning models and determine if they genuinely improve performance or are mostly redundant confirmatory behaviors.

Method: Systematic analysis of 8 reasoning models on 5 mathematical datasets, construction of SFT datasets with varying reflection steps, and development of question-aware early-stopping that truncates reflections after candidate answers appear.

Result: Reflections are predominantly confirmatory and rarely alter initial answers across all models and datasets. Training with more reflection steps primarily enhances first-answer correctness rather than correction ability. Early-stopping reduces reasoning tokens by 24.5% with only 2.9% accuracy drop.

Conclusion: Reflections in current reasoning models serve more as confirmation than correction, and significant token efficiency gains can be achieved through intelligent early-stopping without substantial performance loss.

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated significant gains in
reasoning ability, often attributed to their capacity to generate longer chains
of thought and engage in reflective reasoning. However, the contribution of
reflections to performance improvement remains unclear. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the rollouts of eight reasoning models on five
mathematical datasets. We focus on reflective behaviours where the model has
already produced an answer but continues reflecting before finalizing its
output. Our analysis reveals that reflections are predominantly confirmatory
and rarely alter the model's initial answer, a pattern consistent across models
and datasets. To understand the role of reflections in training, we construct
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets with varying amounts of reflection steps.
We observe that training models on rollouts with more reflection steps
primarily enhances first-answer correctness rather than the ability to correct
initially wrong answers through reflections. This motivates us to propose a
question-aware early-stopping method that enhances inference-time token
efficiency by stopping the reasoning process once a few plausible candidate
answers are generated, thereby reducing unnecessary reflection steps. Motivated
by this, we further propose to dynamically truncate the reflections after a
candidate answer has appeared during generation, which reduces reasoning tokens
by 24.5% across five mathematical datasets, within a 2.9% drop in accuracy.

*Marius Dragoi,Ioana Pintilie,Florin Gogianu,Florin Brad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Cover@tau as an alternative to Pass@k for evaluating reasoning boundaries in LLMs, arguing that Pass@k at large k values reflects random guessing rather than genuine reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the misleading nature of Pass@k metrics at large sampling budgets, where base models appear to outperform RLVR models due to random guessing rather than genuine reasoning capabilities.

Method: Introduces Cover@tau metric that measures the fraction of problems a model can solve where at least a tau proportion of completions are correct, capturing reasoning under an explicit reliability threshold.

Result: Evaluation shows that relative rankings of popular RLVR algorithms change significantly when using Cover@tau compared to Pass@1, providing a different perspective on reasoning boundaries.

Conclusion: Cover@tau offers a more reliable way to assess genuine reasoning capabilities by penalizing models that rely on random guessing, revealing different relative performance between RLVR models and base models.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm to improve Large Language Models on reasoning tasks such as
coding, math or logic. To assess the reasoning boundary (the fraction of
problems a model can solve) researchers often report Pass@k at large sampling
budgets. Recent results reveal a crossover phenomenon: while RLVR models
outperform the base model at small k values, the base model usually outperforms
them when sampling a very large number of completions. This has been
interpreted as evidence that base models have a larger reasoning boundary. We
argue that on tasks with discrete answer spaces, such as math with numeric
outputs, Pass@k at large k reflects the increasingly higher chance of success
in the limit of the number of trials rather than genuine reasoning, and can
therefore be misleading. We propose Cover@tau, which measures the fraction of
problems that a model can solve for which at least a tau proportion of
completions are correct. Unlike Pass@k, Cover@tau captures reasoning under an
explicit reliability threshold: models that rely on random guessing degrade
rapidly as tau increases. We evaluate several RLVR models using Cover@tau-based
metrics and illustrate how the relative rankings of popular algorithms change
compared to Pass@1, offering a different perspective on reasoning boundaries.

Motivation: Traditional consumer research is costly, suffers from panel biases, and has limited scale. LLMs offer an alternative but produce unrealistic numerical ratings when asked directly.

Method: SSR elicits textual responses from LLMs and maps them to Likert distributions using embedding similarity to reference statements.

Result: On 57 personal care product surveys (9,300 human responses), SSR achieved 90% of human test-retest reliability with realistic response distributions (KS similarity > 0.85) and provided rich qualitative feedback.

Conclusion: SSR enables scalable consumer research simulations while preserving traditional survey metrics and interpretability.

Abstract: Consumer research costs companies billions annually yet suffers from panel
biases and limited scale. Large language models (LLMs) offer an alternative by
simulating synthetic consumers, but produce unrealistic response distributions
when asked directly for numerical ratings. We present semantic similarity
rating (SSR), a method that elicits textual responses from LLMs and maps these
to Likert distributions using embedding similarity to reference statements.
Testing on an extensive dataset comprising 57 personal care product surveys
conducted by a leading corporation in that market (9,300 human responses), SSR
achieves 90% of human test-retest reliability while maintaining realistic
response distributions (KS similarity > 0.85). Additionally, these synthetic
respondents provide rich qualitative feedback explaining their ratings. This
framework enables scalable consumer research simulations while preserving
traditional survey metrics and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG struggles with complex query understanding, and RL-trained search agents face generalization and deployment challenges, limiting their effectiveness in knowledge-intensive tasks.

Method: Proposes QAgent framework with modular search agents trained using RL for multi-step decision processes to optimize query understanding through interactive reasoning and retrieval.

Result: Experiments show QAgent excels at QA tasks and serves as an effective plug-and-play module for real-world deployment, enhancing retrieval quality and supporting accurate downstream answers.

Conclusion: QAgent successfully addresses RAG limitations by focusing on effective retrieval through RL-trained modular agents, improving generalization and enabling practical deployment in LLM applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language tasks but are limited
by their static parametric knowledge, especially in knowledge-intensive task.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by integrating external
information. However, (1) traditional RAG struggles with complex query
understanding, and (2) even search agents trained with reinforcement learning
(RL), despite their promise, still face generalization and deployment
challenges. To address these limitations, we propose QAgent, a unified agentic
RAG framework that employs a search agent for adaptive retrieval. This agent
optimizes its understanding of the query through interactive reasoning and
retrieval. To facilitate real-world application, we focus on modular search
agent for query understanding that are plug-and-play in complex systems.
Secifically, the agent follows a multi-step decision process trained with RL to
maximize retrieval quality and support accurate downstream answers. We further
analyze the strengths and weaknesses of end-to-end RL and propose a strategy
that focuses on effective retrieval, thereby enhancing generalization in LLM
applications. Experiments show QAgent excels at QA and serves as a
plug-and-play module for real-world deployment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fundamental challenge of detecting hallucinations in LLMs for trustworthy deployment, going beyond basic uncertainty-driven frameworks.

Method: Quantifies uncertainty by measuring effective rank of hidden states from multiple model outputs and different layers, using spectral analysis of representations.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method effectively detects hallucinations and generalizes robustly across various scenarios.

Conclusion: Provides a new paradigm for hallucination detection that combines theoretical elegance and practical efficiency, contributing to LLM truthfulness.

Abstract: Detecting hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) remains a
fundamental challenge for their trustworthy deployment. Going beyond basic
uncertainty-driven hallucination detection frameworks, we propose a simple yet
powerful method that quantifies uncertainty by measuring the effective rank of
hidden states derived from multiple model outputs and different layers.
Grounded in the spectral analysis of representations, our approach provides
interpretable insights into the model's internal reasoning process through
semantic variations, while requiring no extra knowledge or additional modules,
thus offering a combination of theoretical elegance and practical efficiency.
Meanwhile, we theoretically demonstrate the necessity of quantifying
uncertainty both internally (representations of a single response) and
externally (different responses), providing a justification for using
representations among different layers and responses from LLMs to detect
hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively
detects hallucinations and generalizes robustly across various scenarios,
contributing to a new paradigm of hallucination detection for LLM truthfulness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop vision-language models that can learn effectively with cognitively-plausible amounts of data, requiring new approaches for multimodal information integration.

Method: Lightweight decoder-based architecture with token-wise dynamic gating, feature modulation, channel attention, and auxiliary contrastive objectives for visual grounding.

Result: Competitive or superior performance on five benchmarks (BLiMP, BLiMP Supplement, EWoK, Winoground, VQA) compared to multimodal baselines. Dynamic gate discovers interpretable patterns favoring visual cues for content words and linguistic cues for function words.

Conclusion: Dynamic gating is a powerful tool for efficient multimodal learning, offering both interpretability and performance even under severe constraints, though limitations exist in challenge constraints like global image embeddings and dataset split instability.

Abstract: Training vision-language models on cognitively-plausible amounts of data
requires rethinking how models integrate multimodal information. Within the
constraints of the Vision track for the BabyLM Challenge 2025, we propose a
lightweight decoder-based architecture with (1) token-wise dynamic gating for
adaptive fusion of linguistic and visual cues, (2) feature modulation and
channel attention to maximise the utility of limited visual information and (3)
auxiliary contrastive objectives for visual grounding. Evaluation on five
benchmarks (BLiMP, BLiMP Supplement, EWoK, Winoground and VQA) shows
competitive or superior performance to multimodal baselines. More notably, our
dynamic gate discovers interpretable patterns without explicit supervision,
favouring visual cues for content words and linguistic cues for function words.
While we identify limitations in the Challenge constraints, such as the
information bottleneck created by global image embeddings and training
instability from the dataset split, our findings establish dynamic gating as a
powerful tool for efficient multimodal learning, offering both interpretability
and performance even under severe constraints.

TL;DR: AutoMLGen is an LLM-based coding agent that combines domain knowledge base with Monte Carlo Graph Search to improve performance in Machine Learning Engineering tasks like AutoML and Kaggle competitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack fine-grained domain priors for MLE scenarios, and existing approaches limit knowledge transfer and cannot leverage past trajectories or share information across branches, restricting self-evolution and search diversity.

Method: Integrates domain knowledge base for prior guidance and Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) which embeds graph structure into expansion stage for dynamic path reorganization, historical trajectory reuse, and multi-solution fusion.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MLE-Bench with improved average medal rate and valid submission rate under 12-hour budget (half standard runtime).

Conclusion: AutoMLGen demonstrates superior performance in MLE tasks through its combination of domain knowledge guidance and efficient graph-based search strategy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in general
programming tasks. However, in Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) scenarios
such as AutoML and Kaggle competitions, achieving high performance depends
heavily on expert intervention and repeated adjustments rather than simply
generating correct code. When applied directly to these tasks, LLMs often lack
fine-grained domain priors, and existing MLE approaches that use linear or
tree-structured searches limit knowledge transfer to adjacent hierarchical
links. As a result, they cannot leverage past full trajectories or share
information across branches, limiting self-evolving ability and search space
diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AutoMLGen, an LLM-based
coding agent that integrates a domain knowledge base for high-quality prior
guidance and Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. MCGS
retains the tree-guided exploration of MCTS while embedding a graph structure
into the expansion stage to enable dynamic path reorganization, historical
trajectory reuse, and multi-solution fusion to support both self-evolution and
collaborative learning. Combined with fine-grained operator sets, this design
improves stability and accelerates convergence. Evaluation on the MLE-Bench
shows that AutoMLGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in numerous
dimensions, such as the average medal rate and the valid submission rate, under
a 12-hour budget (half the standard runtime). The code is available at

TL;DR: CaRT teaches LLMs when to stop gathering information by fine-tuning them with counterfactual trajectory pairs and verbal reasoning explanations, improving efficiency and success rates in tasks like medical diagnosis and math problem solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many tasks require strategic information gathering over multiple rounds, but models need to know when to stop gathering information to avoid overthinking or getting derailed when acting.

Method: CaRT fine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories (one where termination is appropriate and a minimally modified version where it's not), training the LLM to explain the rationale for termination decisions via verbal reasoning.

Result: In interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving domains, CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and task success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods.

Conclusion: CaRT effectively teaches LLMs when to terminate information gathering through counterfactual training and verbal reasoning, leading to more efficient and successful task performance.

Abstract: Many tasks require learned models to strategically gather relevant
information over multiple rounds of interaction before actually acting on a
task. Strategic information gathering requires models to know not only how to
effectively acquire information, but also when to stop gathering information
and make a decision, in order to avoid overthinking or getting derailed when
acting. In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals
and Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to
stop seeking information. To appropriately learn when to terminate, CaRT
fine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where
termination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same
trajectory where it is not. It trains the LLM to explain the rationale for the
termination decision in either case via verbal reasoning, and imbues this
capability into the base LLM via fine-tuning. We instantiate CaRT in two
domains: interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving. In both
domains, we find that CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and
task success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: Deep research is an inherently challenging task that demands both breadth and

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'early experience' - agent-generated interaction data where future states serve as supervision without rewards. This bridges imitation learning and reinforcement learning, improving generalization and effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on expert data, which is hard to scale and generalizes poorly due to limited scenario diversity. There's a need for a middle-ground between imitation learning and full reinforcement learning.

Method: Two strategies using early experience: (1) Implicit world modeling - using collected states to ground policy in environment dynamics; (2) Self-reflection - learning from suboptimal actions to improve reasoning and decision-making.

Result: Evaluated across eight diverse environments and multiple model families. Approaches consistently improved effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization. In environments with verifiable rewards, early experience provided strong foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: Early experience offers a practical bridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents, enabling better generalization and positioning agents for successful reinforcement learning.

Abstract: A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own
experience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks.
However, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning
remains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards
(e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn
tool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on
expert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This
limitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a
narrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment
diversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call
early experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where
the resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within
this paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world
modeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment
dynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal
actions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight
diverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently
improve effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value
of early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our
results provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong
foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical
bridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.

*Zhen Zhu,Yiming Gong,Yao Xiao,Yaoyao Liu,Derek Hoiem*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper studies how to teach large multimodal models new skills without forgetting prior abilities, identifies that apparent forgetting can recover later, traces this to output token distribution shifts, and proposes two simple tuning methods that preserve performance while learning new skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of catastrophic forgetting in large multimodal models when sequentially fine-tuning them on new skills, while maintaining their general abilities on held-out tasks.

Method: Sequential fine-tuning on five target skills while monitoring general ability on eight held-out benchmarks across three model families. Identified two simple tuning recipes: (1) updating only self-attention projection layers, and (2) updating only MLP Gate&Up while freezing Down projection.

Result: The methods deliver strong target gains while largely preserving held-out performance across models and tasks. Apparent 'forgetting' on held-out tasks after narrow fine-tuning can partly recover at later stages.

Conclusion: Simple, targeted parameter updates (self-attention projections or MLP Gate&Up only) can effectively teach new skills to large multimodal models while limiting performance drift and preserving prior abilities.

Abstract: How can we teach large multimodal models (LMMs) new skills without erasing
prior abilities? We study sequential fine-tuning on five target skills while
monitoring general ability on eight held-out benchmarks across three model
families. We observe that apparent "forgetting" on held-out tasks after narrow
fine-tuning can partly recover at later stages. We trace this behavior to a
measurable shift in the output token distribution, manifested through a simple
counting-bias probe that co-varies with forgetting. Guided by this picture, we
identify two simple, robust tuning recipes that learn strongly while limiting
drift: (i) updating only the self-attention projection layers, and (ii)
updating only the MLP Gate&Up while freezing the Down projection. Across models
and tasks, these choices deliver strong target gains while largely preserving
held-out performance. Code is available at

### [194] [Deep Learning Based Approach to Enhanced Recognition of Emotions and Behavioral Patterns of Autistic Children](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07320)
*Nelaka K. A. R,Peiris M. K. V,Liyanage R. P. B*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This research focuses on recognizing and mapping behavioral patterns in autistic children as a prerequisite for improving learning and soft skills, particularly in the IT domain where opportunities are limited.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a critical gap in understanding nuanced behavioral patterns and emotional identification in autistic children before skill development, which is essential for effective early intervention and customized educational strategies.

Method: Using a longitudinal approach to monitor emotions and behaviors over time, establishing baseline understanding of unique needs and challenges faced by autistic students in IT domain.

Result: Proposes a targeted framework for developing applications and technical aids designed to meet identified needs through detailed analysis of behavioral trends.

Conclusion: Emphasizes the importance of sequential, evidence-based intervention that prioritizes deep understanding of each child's behavioral and emotional landscape as the foundation for effective skill development and more inclusive learning environments.

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder significantly influences the communication
abilities, learning processes, behavior, and social interactions of
individuals. Although early intervention and customized educational strategies
are critical to improving outcomes, there is a pivotal gap in understanding and
addressing nuanced behavioral patterns and emotional identification in autistic
children prior to skill development. This extended research delves into the
foundational step of recognizing and mapping these patterns as a prerequisite
to improving learning and soft skills. Using a longitudinal approach to monitor
emotions and behaviors, this study aims to establish a baseline understanding
of the unique needs and challenges faced by autistic students, particularly in
the Information Technology domain, where opportunities are markedly limited.
Through a detailed analysis of behavioral trends over time, we propose a
targeted framework for developing applications and technical aids designed to
meet these identified needs. Our research underscores the importance of a
sequential and evidence-based intervention approach that prioritizes a deep
understanding of each child's behavioral and emotional landscape as the basis
for effective skill development. By shifting the focus toward early
identification of behavioral patterns, we aim to foster a more inclusive and
supportive learning environment that can significantly improve the educational
and developmental trajectory of children with ASD.

### [195] [A Modality-Aware Cooperative Co-Evolutionary Framework for Multimodal Graph Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07325)
*Sixuan Wang,Jiao Yin,Jinli Cao,Mingjian Tang,Yong-Feng Ge*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MACC-MGNAS is a modality-aware cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm for multimodal graph neural architecture search that addresses co-exploitation attacks by effectively integrating heterogeneous vulnerability data across modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Co-exploitation attacks on software vulnerabilities pose severe risks to enterprises, and existing genetic algorithm-based graph neural architecture search methods are confined to single modalities and overlook modality heterogeneity.

Method: Proposes MACC-MGNAS with three key components: modality-aware cooperative co-evolution framework that partitions populations into modality-specific groups, modality-aware dual-track surrogate method to reduce evaluation costs, and similarity-based population diversity indicator strategy to balance exploration and exploitation.

Result: Achieves F1-score of 81.67% within only 3 GPU-hours, outperforming state-of-the-art competitor by 8.7% F1 while reducing computation cost by 27% on VulCE dataset.

Conclusion: MACC-MGNAS effectively addresses modality heterogeneity in graph neural architecture search and provides an efficient solution for vulnerability co-exploitation prediction.

Abstract: Co-exploitation attacks on software vulnerabilities pose severe risks to
enterprises, a threat that can be mitigated by analyzing heterogeneous and
multimodal vulnerability data. Multimodal graph neural networks (MGNNs) are
well-suited to integrate complementary signals across modalities, thereby
improving attack-prediction accuracy. However, designing an effective MGNN
architecture is challenging because it requires coordinating modality-specific
components at each layer, which is infeasible through manual tuning. Genetic
algorithm (GA)-based graph neural architecture search (GNAS) provides a natural
solution, yet existing methods are confined to single modalities and overlook
modality heterogeneity. To address this limitation, we propose a modality-aware
cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm for multimodal graph neural architecture
search, termed MACC-MGNAS. First, we develop a modality-aware cooperative
co-evolution (MACC) framework under a divide-and-conquer paradigm: a
coordinator partitions a global chromosome population into modality-specific
gene groups, local workers evolve them independently, and the coordinator
reassembles chromosomes for joint evaluation. This framework effectively
captures modality heterogeneity ignored by single-modality GNAS. Second, we
introduce a modality-aware dual-track surrogate (MADTS) method to reduce
evaluation cost and accelerate local gene evolution. Third, we design a
similarity-based population diversity indicator (SPDI) strategy to adaptively
balance exploration and exploitation, thereby accelerating convergence and
avoiding local optima. On a standard vulnerabilities co-exploitation (VulCE)
dataset, MACC-MGNAS achieves an F1-score of 81.67% within only 3 GPU-hours,
outperforming the state-of-the-art competitor by 8.7% F1 while reducing
computation cost by 27%.

### [196] [MultiFair: Multimodal Balanced Fairness-Aware Medical Classification with Dual-Level Gradient Modulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07328)
*Md Zubair,Hao Zheng,Nussdorf Jonathan,Grayson W. Armstrong,Lucy Q. Shen,Gabriela Wilson,Yu Tian,Xingquan Zhu,Min Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MultiFair addresses multimodal bias and unfairness in medical AI by dynamically modulating gradients at both modality and group levels during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal models often show bias towards certain data modalities and demographic groups, leading to unreliable and unfair medical diagnoses.

Method: MultiFair uses a dual-level gradient modulation process that dynamically adjusts training gradients based on optimization direction and magnitude at both modality and group levels.

Result: Experiments on two multimodal medical datasets show MultiFair outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal learning and fairness methods.

Conclusion: MultiFair effectively addresses both modality imbalance and demographic unfairness in multimodal medical classification through its dual-level gradient modulation approach.

Abstract: Medical decision systems increasingly rely on data from multiple sources to
ensure reliable and unbiased diagnosis. However, existing multimodal learning
models fail to achieve this goal because they often ignore two critical
challenges. First, various data modalities may learn unevenly, thereby
converging to a model biased towards certain modalities. Second, the model may
emphasize learning on certain demographic groups causing unfair performances.
The two aspects can influence each other, as different data modalities may
favor respective groups during optimization, leading to both imbalanced and
unfair multimodal learning. This paper proposes a novel approach called
MultiFair for multimodal medical classification, which addresses these
challenges with a dual-level gradient modulation process. MultiFair dynamically
modulates training gradients regarding the optimization direction and magnitude
at both data modality and group levels. We conduct extensive experiments on two
multimodal medical datasets with different demographic groups. The results show
that MultiFair outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal learning and fairness
learning methods.

### [197] [Out-of-Distribution Generalization in Climate-Aware Yield Prediction with Earth Observation Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07350)
*Aditya Chakravarty*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks two deep learning models (GNN-RNN and MMST-ViT) for crop yield forecasting under realistic out-of-distribution conditions, finding that GNN-RNN generalizes better across geographic regions while being much faster to train.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate change is disrupting agriculture, making accurate crop yield forecasting essential for food security. While deep learning models show promise, their ability to generalize across geographic regions and years remains largely untested, which is critical for real-world deployment.

Method: Used the large-scale CropNet dataset spanning 1,200+ U.S. counties from 2017-2022. Benchmarked GNN-RNN and MMST-ViT models using leave-one-cluster-out cross-validation across seven USDA Farm Resource Regions and year-ahead prediction scenarios to test out-of-distribution generalization.

Result: GNN-RNN demonstrated superior generalization with positive correlations under geographic shifts, while MMST-ViT performed well in-domain but degraded sharply under OOD conditions. GNN-RNN achieved 135x faster training (14 minutes vs. 31.5 hours). Some regions showed stable transfer dynamics while others exhibited persistent underperformance.

Conclusion: Spatial-temporal alignment - not merely model complexity or data scale - is key to robust generalization. The findings highlight the need for transparent OOD evaluation protocols to ensure equitable and reliable climate-aware agricultural forecasting.

Abstract: Climate change is increasingly disrupting agricultural systems, making
accurate crop yield forecasting essential for food security. While deep
learning models have shown promise in yield prediction using satellite and
weather data, their ability to generalize across geographic regions and years -
critical for real-world deployment - remains largely untested. We benchmark two
state-of-the-art models, GNN-RNN and MMST-ViT, under realistic
out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions using the large-scale CropNet dataset
spanning 1,200+ U.S. counties from 2017-2022. Through leave-one-cluster-out
cross-validation across seven USDA Farm Resource Regions and year-ahead
prediction scenarios, we identify substantial variability in cross-region
transferability. GNN-RNN demonstrates superior generalization with positive
correlations under geographic shifts, while MMST-ViT performs well in-domain
but degrades sharply under OOD conditions. Regions like Heartland and Northern
Great Plains show stable transfer dynamics (RMSE less than 10 bu/acre for
soybean), whereas Prairie Gateway exhibits persistent underperformance (RMSE
greater than 20 bu/acre) across both models and crops, revealing structural
dissimilarities likely driven by semi-arid climate, irrigation patterns, and
incomplete spectral coverage. Beyond accuracy differences, GNN-RNN achieves
135x faster training than MMST-ViT (14 minutes vs. 31.5 hours), making it more
viable for sustainable deployment. Our findings underscore that
spatial-temporal alignment - not merely model complexity or data scale - is key
to robust generalization, and highlight the need for transparent OOD evaluation
protocols to ensure equitable and reliable climate-aware agricultural
forecasting.

*Lingcheng Kong,Jiateng Wei,Hanzhang Shen,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses GPU kernel generation data scarcity by creating ConCuR dataset with reasoning traces and introduces KernelCoder model, which outperforms existing models including frontier models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of high-quality kernel data prevents supervised fine-tuning for kernel generation tasks, as most high-quality kernels are proprietary.

Method: Developed a pipeline to generate and curate high-quality CUDA kernels with reasoning traces, constructing ConCuR dataset and training KernelCoder model on PyTorch-reasoning-CUDA kernel pairs.

Result: KernelCoder achieves significant improvements over QwQ-32B, outperforms all open-source kernel generation models and frontier models like DeepSeek-V3.1-Think and Claude-4-sonnet in KernelBench setup.

Conclusion: Average reasoning length can assess kernel generation difficulty, and the pipeline, metrics, and observations can help obtain better kernel generation data in the future.

Abstract: GPU kernel generation by LLMs has recently experienced rapid development,
leveraging test-time scaling and reinforcement learning techniques. However, a
key challenge for kernel generation is the scarcity of high-quality data, as
most high-quality kernels are proprietary and not open-source. This challenge
prevents us from leveraging supervised fine-tuning to align LLMs to the kernel
generation task. To address this challenge, we develop a pipeline that
generates and curates high-quality CUDA kernels with reasoning traces,
motivated by a critical observation that concise yet informative reasoning
traces result in robust generation of high-performance kernels. Using this
pipeline, we construct our dataset ConCuR and introduce our model KernelCoder,
which is the first model trained on a curated dataset consisting of PyTorch,
reasoning, and CUDA kernel pairs, to our knowledge. In the KernelBench setup,
our model achieves significant improvements over the existing top-performing
model, QwQ-32B, and outperforms all open-source models fine-tuned for kernel
generation, as well as frontier models such as DeepSeek-V3.1-Think and
Claude-4-sonnet. Finally, we show that the average reasoning length can serve
as a metric to assess the difficulty of kernel generation tasks. The
observations, metrics, and our data collection and curation pipeline can help
obtain better data in the kernel generation task in the future.

### [199] [Encode, Think, Decode: Scaling test-time reasoning with recursive latent thoughts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07358)
*Yeskendir Koishekenov,Aldo Lipani,Nicola Cancedda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ETD enhances LLM reasoning by training models to iterate over reasoning-relevant layers during mid-training, achieving substantial gains on reasoning benchmarks without changing architecture or parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to improve LLM reasoning involve scaling parameters/training data or complex chains of thought, but interpretability studies show reasoning computation is concentrated in limited layers.

Method: Encode-Think-Decode (ETD) trains base models to iterate over a small subset of reasoning-relevant layers during mid-training, preserving original architecture while amplifying latent reasoning capabilities.

Result: ETD models achieved +28.4% accuracy improvement on GSM8K and +36% on MATH with OLMo-2 1B Base model, with substantial gains across 17 reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Recursive latent reasoning through ETD offers a simple and effective path to stronger LLM reasoning capabilities without architectural changes.

Abstract: Most efforts to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) involve either scaling the number of parameters and the size of training
data, or scaling inference computation by letting models generate complex
chains of thought. Motivated by interpretability studies showing that the
crucial computation required for reasoning tasks is concentrated in a limited
range of layers, we introduce Encode-Think-Decode (ETD), a method that enhances
the reasoning capabilities of a base model by training it to iterate over a
small subset of reasoning-relevant layers during the mid-training stage. ETD
amplifies latent reasoning while preserving the original architecture,
parameter count, hyperparameters, and training data composition. When iterating
on the selected layers at inference time, ETD models yield substantial gains on
17 reasoning benchmarks, including +28.4% relative accuracy improvement on
GSM8K and +36% on MATH with the OLMo-2 1B Base model. We also explore an
adaptive depth strategy that adjusts the computation per input token. Our
results show that recursive latent reasoning offers a simple and effective path
to stronger LLM reasoning.

*Shuangyi Chen,Ashish Khisti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SurpMark is a reference-based detector that uses token surprisal dynamics to distinguish machine-generated text from human text, working effectively even when the proxy LM mismatches the source model and without requiring costly per-input contrastive generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To detect machine-generated text under practical constraints where the scoring model may not match the unknown source model and per-input contrastive generation is too costly.

Method: Quantizes token surprisals into interpretable states, estimates state-transition matrices for test text, and scores using generalized Jensen-Shannon gap between test transitions and fixed human/machine references built from historical corpora.

Result: Consistently matches or surpasses baselines across multiple datasets, source models, and scenarios; experiments corroborate asymptotic normality of the decision statistic and validate discretization effectiveness.

Conclusion: SurpMark provides an effective and practical approach for machine-generated text detection that works well under realistic constraints and outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: We study black-box detection of machine-generated text under practical
constraints: the scoring model (proxy LM) may mismatch the unknown source
model, and per-input contrastive generation is costly. We propose SurpMark, a
reference-based detector that summarizes a passage by the dynamics of its token
surprisals. SurpMark quantizes surprisals into interpretable states, estimates
a state-transition matrix for the test text, and scores it via a generalized
Jensen-Shannon (GJS) gap between the test transitions and two fixed references
(human vs. machine) built once from historical corpora. We prove a principled
discretization criterion and establish the asymptotic normality of the decision
statistic. Empirically, across multiple datasets, source models, and scenarios,
SurpMark consistently matches or surpasses baselines; our experiments
corroborate the statistic's asymptotic normality, and ablations validate the
effectiveness of the proposed discretization.

*Nathan Boyer,Dorian Baudry,Patrick Rebeschini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Best-of-Both-Worlds algorithm for linear contextual bandits with paid observations that achieves minimax-optimal regret in adversarial settings and poly-logarithmic regret in stochastic regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of linear contextual bandits where the learner can pay a fixed cost to observe arm losses, aiming to develop an algorithm that performs well in both adversarial and stochastic environments.

Method: Follow-the-Regularized-Leader framework with efficient estimators via Matrix Geometric Resampling, building on the BOBW framework for hard problems with tailored analysis techniques.

Result: The algorithm achieves Θ(T^{2/3}) minimax-optimal regret in adversarial settings and poly-logarithmic regret in corrupted stochastic regimes.

Conclusion: The proposed BOBW algorithm provides computationally efficient performance guarantees for linear contextual bandits with paid observations across different environmental settings.

Abstract: We study the problem of linear contextual bandits with paid observations,
where at each round the learner selects an action in order to minimize its loss
in a given context, and can then decide to pay a fixed cost to observe the loss
of any arm. Building on the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader framework with
efficient estimators via Matrix Geometric Resampling, we introduce a
computationally efficient Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) algorithm for this
problem. We show that it achieves the minimax-optimal regret of
$\Theta(T^{2/3})$ in adversarial settings, while guaranteeing poly-logarithmic
regret in (corrupted) stochastic regimes. Our approach builds on the framework
from \cite{BOBWhardproblems} to design BOBW algorithms for ``hard problem'',
using analysis techniques tailored for the setting that we consider.

*Tianyu Bell Pan,Damon L. Woodard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multimodal co-training framework that improves model generalization with limited labeled data and distribution shifts, using theoretical analysis to show benefits of unlabeled data, inter-modal agreement, and conditional view independence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges of limited labeled data and distribution shifts in real-world environments by developing a structured multimodal co-training approach for data-efficient and robust AI systems.

Method: Multimodal co-training framework that leverages unlabeled data, promotes agreement between classifiers for different modalities, and maintains conditional view independence, with theoretical analysis of convergence and generalization bounds.

Result: Theoretical analysis confirms effectiveness of iterative co-training in reducing classification errors and establishes novel generalization bound quantifying advantages from unlabeled multimodal data, inter-view agreement, and conditional view independence.

Conclusion: Multimodal co-training provides practical benefits for developing data-efficient and robust AI systems that can effectively generalize in dynamic real-world environments, with theoretical foundations advancing established co-training principles.

Abstract: This paper explores a multimodal co-training framework designed to enhance
model generalization in situations where labeled data is limited and
distribution shifts occur. We thoroughly examine the theoretical foundations of
this framework, deriving conditions under which the use of unlabeled data and
the promotion of agreement between classifiers for different modalities lead to
significant improvements in generalization. We also present a convergence
analysis that confirms the effectiveness of iterative co-training in reducing
classification errors. In addition, we establish a novel generalization bound
that, for the first time in a multimodal co-training context, decomposes and
quantifies the distinct advantages gained from leveraging unlabeled multimodal
data, promoting inter-view agreement, and maintaining conditional view
independence. Our findings highlight the practical benefits of multimodal
co-training as a structured approach to developing data-efficient and robust AI
systems that can effectively generalize in dynamic, real-world environments.
The theoretical foundations are examined in dialogue with, and in advance of,
established co-training principles.

### [203] [Learning to Route LLMs from Bandit Feedback: One Policy, Many Trade-offs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07429)
*Wang Wei,Tiankai Yang,Hongjie Chen,Yue Zhao,Franck Dernoncourt,Ryan A. Rossi,Hoda Eldardiry*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BaRP is a bandit-feedback routing system that trains LLM routers under partial feedback constraints like deployment, enabling preference-tunable inference without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM routing systems require full offline supervision with labels for all models, which doesn't match deployment conditions where only chosen model outcomes are observed, creating a training-deployment gap.

Method: Framed as a contextual bandit using prompt features and user preference vectors, BaRP simulates online feedback during training and adapts routing decisions per prompt without full-information supervision.

Result: BaRP consistently outperforms strong offline routers by at least 12.46% and the largest LLM by at least 2.45%, with robust generalization to unseen tasks.

Conclusion: BaRP successfully bridges the training-deployment gap in LLM routing by operating under realistic partial-feedback constraints while supporting flexible performance/cost trade-offs at inference time.

Abstract: Efficient use of large language models (LLMs) is critical for deployment at
scale: without adaptive routing, systems either overpay for strong models or
risk poor performance from weaker ones. Selecting the right LLM for each query
is fundamentally an online decision problem: models differ in strengths, prices
fluctuate, and users value accuracy and cost differently. Yet most routers are
trained offline with labels for all candidate models, an assumption that breaks
in deployment, where only the outcome of the chosen model is observed. We
bridge this gap with BaRP, a Bandit-feedback Routing with Preferences approach
that trains under the same partial-feedback restriction as deployment, while
supporting preference-tunable inference: operators can dial the
performance/cost trade-off at test time without retraining. Framed as a
contextual bandit over prompt features and a user preference vector, our method
simulates an online feedback setting during training and adapts its routing
decisions to each new prompt, rather than depending on full-information offline
supervision. Comprehensive experiments show that our method consistently
outperforms strong offline routers by at least 12.46% and the largest LLM by at
least 2.45%, and generalizes robustly for unseen tasks.

*Diego García-Pérez,Emilio Parrado-Hernández,John Shawe-Taylor*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper improves PAC-Bayes risk certificates for neural networks through four theoretical contributions: tighter KL divergence bounds for Bernoulli distributions, implicit differentiation methodology for optimizing certificates, optimization methods for non-differentiable objectives, and presents first non-vacuous generalization bounds on CIFAR-10.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the usability and tightness of risk certificates for neural networks based on PAC-Bayes bounds, enabling better generalization guarantees and practical optimization of risk certificates.

Method: Developed four theoretical contributions: 1) tighter KL divergence bounds for Bernoulli distributions, 2) implicit differentiation methodology for optimizing PAC-Bayesian certificates within loss functions, 3) optimization methods for non-differentiable objectives like 0-1 loss, and evaluated on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.

Result: Achieved the first non-vacuous generalization bounds on CIFAR-10 for neural networks, demonstrating improved risk certificate tightness and practical applicability.

Conclusion: The theoretical contributions significantly advance PAC-Bayes risk certification for neural networks, providing tighter bounds and practical optimization methods that enable meaningful generalization guarantees on complex datasets like CIFAR-10.

Abstract: This paper presents four theoretical contributions that improve the usability
of risk certificates for neural networks based on PAC-Bayes bounds. First, two
bounds on the KL divergence between Bernoulli distributions enable the
derivation of the tightest explicit bounds on the true risk of classifiers
across different ranges of empirical risk. The paper next focuses on the
formalization of an efficient methodology based on implicit differentiation
that enables the introduction of the optimization of PAC-Bayesian risk
certificates inside the loss/objective function used to fit the network/model.
The last contribution is a method to optimize bounds on non-differentiable
objectives such as the 0-1 loss. These theoretical contributions are
complemented with an empirical evaluation on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.
In fact, this paper presents the first non-vacuous generalization bounds on
CIFAR-10 for neural networks.

*Ankur Naskar,Gugan Thoppe,Utsav Negi,Vijay Gupta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a parameter-free Federated Temporal Difference (FTD) learning method with Polyak-Ruppert averaging that achieves optimal O(1/NT) convergence rate for reinforcement learning with Markovian data in federated settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated TD learning methods require knowledge of unknown problem parameters to achieve optimal convergence rates when training samples come from Markov chains, creating a practical limitation.

Method: Two-timescale Federated Temporal Difference (FTD) learning with Polyak-Ruppert averaging, which is parameter-free and handles Markovian data.

Result: The method provably attains the optimal O(1/NT) convergence rate in both average-reward and discounted settings, and works with heterogeneous environments in federated learning.

Conclusion: This work closes the gap in federated TD learning by providing a parameter-free approach that achieves optimal convergence rates for Markovian data, applicable to both single-agent and heterogeneous federated learning scenarios.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) can dramatically speed up reinforcement learning by
distributing exploration and training across multiple agents. It can guarantee
an optimal convergence rate that scales linearly in the number of agents, i.e.,
a rate of $\tilde{O}(1/(NT)),$ where $T$ is the iteration index and $N$ is the
number of agents. However, when the training samples arise from a Markov chain,
existing results on TD learning achieving this rate require the algorithm to
depend on unknown problem parameters. We close this gap by proposing a
two-timescale Federated Temporal Difference (FTD) learning with Polyak-Ruppert
averaging. Our method provably attains the optimal $\tilde{O}(1/NT)$ rate in
both average-reward and discounted settings--offering a parameter-free FTD
approach for Markovian data. Although our results are novel even in the
single-agent setting, they apply to the more realistic and challenging scenario
of FL with heterogeneous environments.

### [206] [MoGU: Mixture-of-Gaussians with Uncertainty-based Gating for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07459)
*Yoli Shavit,Jacob Goldberger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoGU is a Mixture-of-Experts framework for regression tasks that models expert outputs as Gaussian distributions and uses uncertainty-based gating instead of input-based gating, achieving better performance and uncertainty quantification in time series forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Mixture-of-Experts frameworks only provide point estimates without uncertainty quantification, limiting their reliability in regression tasks like time series forecasting where uncertainty awareness is crucial.

Method: Models each expert's output as a Gaussian distribution (mean and variance) and replaces traditional input-based gating with an uncertainty-based gating mechanism that uses each expert's estimated variance to determine contribution weights.

Result: Outperforms single-expert models and traditional MoE setups across diverse time series forecasting benchmarks, while providing well-quantified uncertainties that directly correlate with prediction errors.

Conclusion: MoGU provides an effective framework for regression tasks that combines improved forecasting performance with reliable uncertainty quantification through its novel uncertainty-based gating mechanism.

Abstract: We introduce Mixture-of-Gaussians with Uncertainty-based Gating (MoGU), a
novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework designed for regression tasks and
applied to time series forecasting. Unlike conventional MoEs that provide only
point estimates, MoGU models each expert's output as a Gaussian distribution.
This allows it to directly quantify both the forecast (the mean) and its
inherent uncertainty (variance). MoGU's core innovation is its
uncertainty-based gating mechanism, which replaces the traditional input-based
gating network by using each expert's estimated variance to determine its
contribution to the final prediction. Evaluated across diverse time series
forecasting benchmarks, MoGU consistently outperforms single-expert models and
traditional MoE setups. It also provides well-quantified, informative
uncertainties that directly correlate with prediction errors, enhancing
forecast reliability. Our code is available from:

### [207] [On the optimization dynamics of RLVR: Gradient gap and step size thresholds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08539)
*Joe Suk,Yaqi Duan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides a theoretical foundation for RLVR (Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards), analyzing why it works by examining the training process at trajectory and token levels through the concept of Gradient Gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR has shown empirical success in post-training LLMs using binary feedback, but there has been a lack of principled understanding of why it works effectively.

Method: The authors analyze RLVR training at full-response and token levels, introducing the concept of Gradient Gap to formalize improvement direction from low-reward to high-reward regions. They derive a step-size threshold based on Gradient Gap magnitude and validate through bandit simulations and LLM experiments.

Result: The theory shows convergence depends on aligning update direction with Gradient Gap, and reveals a sharp step-size threshold: below it learning converges, above it performance collapses. The analysis also explains why practical heuristics like length normalization improve stability.

Conclusion: The theoretical framework successfully explains RLVR's empirical success, provides principled understanding of convergence conditions, and predicts performance limitations with fixed learning rates.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which uses simple
binary feedback to post-train large language models, has shown significant
empirical success. However, a principled understanding of why it works has been
lacking. This paper builds a theoretical foundation for RLVR by analyzing its
training process at both the full-response (trajectory) and token levels.
Central to our analysis is a quantity called the Gradient Gap, which formalizes
the direction of improvement from low-reward to high-reward regions of the
response space. We prove that convergence critically depends on aligning the
update direction with this Gradient Gap. Moreover, we derive a sharp step-size
threshold based on the magnitude of the Gradient Gap: below it, learning
converges, whereas above it, performance collapses. Our theory further predicts
how the critical step size must scale with response length and the success
rate, thereby explaining why practical heuristics such as length normalization
improve stability and showing that, with a fixed learning rate, the success
rate can stagnate strictly below $100\%$. We validate these predictions through
controlled bandit simulations and LLM experiments, including training
Qwen2.5-7B with GRPO.

*Alex Kipnis,Marcel Binz,Eric Schulz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Metabeta is a transformer-based neural network model for Bayesian mixed-effects regression that uses neural posterior estimation to amortize computation costs, achieving comparable performance to MCMC methods much faster.


<details>

Motivation: Bayesian inference for hierarchical data with multiple observations per group is analytically intractable and requires costly MCMC approximation, which is computationally expensive.

Method: Proposed metabeta, a transformer-based neural network model using neural posterior estimation that shifts computation from inference time to pre-training time by amortizing over simulated datasets with known ground truth.

Result: The model reaches stable and comparable performance to MCMC-based parameter estimation at a fraction of the usually required time, as demonstrated on simulated and real data.

Conclusion: Metabeta provides an efficient alternative to MCMC for Bayesian mixed-effects regression, significantly reducing computation time while maintaining comparable performance.

Abstract: Hierarchical data with multiple observations per group is ubiquitous in
empirical sciences and is often analyzed using mixed-effects regression. In
such models, Bayesian inference gives an estimate of uncertainty but is
analytically intractable and requires costly approximation using Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Neural posterior estimation shifts the bulk of
computation from inference time to pre-training time, amortizing over simulated
datasets with known ground truth targets. We propose metabeta, a
transformer-based neural network model for Bayesian mixed-effects regression.
Using simulated and real data, we show that it reaches stable and comparable
performance to MCMC-based parameter estimation at a fraction of the usually
required time.

### [209] [Surrogate Modeling for the Design of Optimal Lattice Structures using Tensor Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07474)
*Shaan Pakala,Aldair E. Gongora,Brian Giera,Evangelos E. Papalexakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tensor completion outperforms traditional ML methods for materials design with biased training data, achieving 5% higher R² while maintaining comparable performance with uniform sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Materials design faces exponential search space growth, and traditional ML methods struggle when training data comes from non-uniform sampling (e.g., experimental convenience bias).

Method: Use tensor completion as a surrogate model for materials design, particularly for lattice structures with mechanical performance optimization.

Result: Tensor completion shows 5% increased R² compared to Gaussian Process and XGBoost with biased sampling, and maintains comparable performance with uniform random sampling.

Conclusion: Tensor completion is an effective approach for accelerating materials design, especially in scenarios with biased training data sampling.

Abstract: When designing new materials, it is often necessary to design a material with
specific desired properties. Unfortunately, as new design variables are added,
the search space grows exponentially, which makes synthesizing and validating
the properties of each material very impractical and time-consuming. In this
work, we focus on the design of optimal lattice structures with regard to
mechanical performance. Computational approaches, including the use of machine
learning (ML) methods, have shown improved success in accelerating materials
design. However, these ML methods are still lacking in scenarios when training
data (i.e. experimentally validated materials) come from a non-uniformly random
sampling across the design space. For example, an experimentalist might
synthesize and validate certain materials more frequently because of
convenience. For this reason, we suggest the use of tensor completion as a
surrogate model to accelerate the design of materials in these atypical
supervised learning scenarios. In our experiments, we show that tensor
completion is superior to classic ML methods such as Gaussian Process and
XGBoost with biased sampling of the search space, with around 5\% increased
$R^2$. Furthermore, tensor completion still gives comparable performance with a
uniformly random sampling of the entire search space.

### [210] [Estimating Fair Graphs from Graph-Stationary Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07536)
*Madeline Navarro,Andrei Buciulea,Samuel Rey,Antonio G. Marques,Santiago Segarra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes FairSpecTemp, an optimization-based method for estimating fair graphs from stationary graph signals, addressing bias in graph connections with respect to sensitive attributes through group and individual fairness metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world graphs often exhibit biased connections that can exacerbate or induce unfair treatment in downstream graph-based tasks. These biases can occur between different groups based on sensitive attributes.

Method: Proposes FairSpecTemp with two variants: one exploits commutativity properties of graph stationarity while directly constraining bias, and another implicitly encourages fair estimates by restricting bias in the graph spectrum. Both methods use optimization-based approaches with novel spectral domain bias measurements.

Result: The methods enjoy high probability performance bounds and demonstrate effectiveness on synthetic and real-world datasets. Analysis reveals that accuracy need not be sacrificed to recover fair graphs, showing a conditional tradeoff between fairness and accuracy.

Conclusion: FairSpecTemp effectively estimates fair graphs from stationary graph signals, with both variants showing advantages in different scenarios, and demonstrates that fairness can be achieved without compromising accuracy in graph-based tasks.

Abstract: We estimate fair graphs from graph-stationary nodal observations such that
connections are not biased with respect to sensitive attributes. Edges in
real-world graphs often exhibit preferences for connecting certain pairs of
groups. Biased connections can not only exacerbate but even induce unfair
treatment for downstream graph-based tasks. We therefore consider group and
individual fairness for graphs corresponding to group- and node-level
definitions, respectively. To evaluate the fairness of a given graph, we
provide multiple bias metrics, including novel measurements in the spectral
domain. Furthermore, we propose Fair Spectral Templates (FairSpecTemp), an
optimization-based method with two variants for estimating fair graphs from
stationary graph signals, a general model for graph data subsuming many
existing ones. One variant of FairSpecTemp exploits commutativity properties of
graph stationarity while directly constraining bias, while the other implicitly
encourages fair estimates by restricting bias in the graph spectrum and is thus
more flexible. Our methods enjoy high probability performance bounds, yielding
a conditional tradeoff between fairness and accuracy. In particular, our
analysis reveals that accuracy need not be sacrificed to recover fair graphs.
We evaluate FairSpecTemp on synthetic and real-world data sets to illustrate
its effectiveness and highlight the advantages of both variants of
FairSpecTemp.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HEMERA is an explainable transformer model that uses GWAS data to predict lung cancer risk with high accuracy (>99% AUC), enabling transparent risk assessment without clinical covariates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer deaths, and while smoking is the primary risk factor, genetic factors play a significant role in never-smokers and familial cases. Current GWAS approaches need more interpretability and direct genotype processing capabilities.

Method: HEMERA applies explainable transformer-based deep learning directly to raw GWAS genotype data, using additive positional encodings, neural genotype embeddings, and refined variant filtering. It includes a post hoc explainability module based on Layer-wise Integrated Gradients to attribute predictions to specific SNPs.

Result: Trained on 27,254 Million Veteran Program participants, HEMERA achieved >99% AUC score. The model's predictions strongly align with known lung cancer risk loci, demonstrating high accuracy and biological relevance.

Conclusion: HEMERA supports transparent, hypothesis-generating models for personalized lung cancer risk assessment and early intervention, providing an explainable framework that directly processes genetic data without requiring clinical covariates.

Abstract: Lung cancer (LC) is the third most common cancer and the leading cause of
cancer deaths in the US. Although smoking is the primary risk factor, the
occurrence of LC in never-smokers and familial aggregation studies highlight a
genetic component. Genetic biomarkers identified through genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) are promising tools for assessing LC risk. We
introduce HEMERA (Human-Explainable Transformer Model for Estimating Lung
Cancer Risk using GWAS Data), a new framework that applies explainable
transformer-based deep learning to GWAS data of single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) for predicting LC risk. Unlike prior approaches, HEMERA directly
processes raw genotype data without clinical covariates, introducing additive
positional encodings, neural genotype embeddings, and refined variant
filtering. A post hoc explainability module based on Layer-wise Integrated
Gradients enables attribution of model predictions to specific SNPs, aligning
strongly with known LC risk loci. Trained on data from 27,254 Million Veteran
Program participants, HEMERA achieved >99% AUC (area under receiver
characteristics) score. These findings support transparent,
hypothesis-generating models for personalized LC risk assessment and early
intervention.

*Sizhe Ma,Katherine A. Flanigan,Mario Bergés,James D. Brooks*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an unsupervised deep learning approach using an Attention-Focused Transformer for indirect structural health monitoring of railway tracks, focusing on detecting small broken rail anomalies through onboard sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current indirect structural health monitoring (iSHM) for broken rail detection faces challenges in reliably detecting small (2-10 cm) transient anomalies due to complex vehicle dynamics, signal noise, and limited labeled data for supervised learning approaches.

Method: The authors introduce an incremental synthetic data benchmark and propose an Attention-Focused Transformer model that uses self-attention mechanisms trained via reconstruction, deriving anomaly scores from deviations in learned attention weights for computational efficiency.

Result: Transformer-based models generally outperform others, but all models show significant vulnerability to high-frequency localized noise. The proposed model achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art solutions while offering better inference speed.

Conclusion: The study identifies noise robustness as a critical bottleneck for practical deployment and positions the attention-based approach as a promising foundation for developing efficient onboard anomaly detection systems in iSHM applications.

Abstract: Indirect structural health monitoring (iSHM) for broken rail detection using
onboard sensors presents a cost-effective paradigm for railway track
assessment, yet reliably detecting small, transient anomalies (2-10 cm) remains
a significant challenge due to complex vehicle dynamics, signal noise, and the
scarcity of labeled data limiting supervised approaches. This study addresses
these issues through unsupervised deep learning. We introduce an incremental
synthetic data benchmark designed to systematically evaluate model robustness
against progressively complex challenges like speed variations, multi-channel
inputs, and realistic noise patterns encountered in iSHM. Using this benchmark,
we evaluate several established unsupervised models alongside our proposed
Attention-Focused Transformer. Our model employs a self-attention mechanism,
trained via reconstruction but innovatively deriving anomaly scores primarily
from deviations in learned attention weights, aiming for both effectiveness and
computational efficiency. Benchmarking results reveal that while
transformer-based models generally outperform others, all tested models exhibit
significant vulnerability to high-frequency localized noise, identifying this
as a critical bottleneck for practical deployment. Notably, our proposed model
achieves accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art solution while
demonstrating better inference speed. This highlights the crucial need for
enhanced noise robustness in future iSHM models and positions our more
efficient attention-based approach as a promising foundation for developing
practical onboard anomaly detection systems.

*Waleed Bin Qaim,Aleksandr Ometov,Claudia Campolo,Antonella Molinaro,Elena Simona Lohan,Jari Nurmi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a Reinforcement Learning-based task offloading framework for Internet of Wearable Things to optimize energy consumption and task completion time using Q-learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wearable devices face challenges with limited battery power and computation resources, while there's increasing demand for computationally intensive and latency-critical applications.

Method: Formulates task offloading as Markov Decision Process and uses Q-learning technique to enable wearable devices to make optimal offloading decisions without prior knowledge.

Result: Evaluated through extensive ns-3 network simulations showing performance in terms of task accomplishment time, energy consumption, and offloading percentage under various parameters.

Conclusion: The RL-based framework effectively addresses the tradeoff between energy consumption and task completion time in IoWT environments.

Abstract: Over the years, significant contributions have been made by the research and
industrial sectors to improve wearable devices towards the Internet of Wearable
Things (IoWT) paradigm. However, wearables are still facing several challenges.
Many stem from the limited battery power and insufficient computation resources
available on wearable devices. On the other hand, with the popularity of smart
wearables, there is a consistent increase in the development of new
computationally intensive and latency-critical applications. In such a context,
task offloading allows wearables to leverage the resources available on nearby
edge devices to enhance the overall user experience. This paper proposes a
framework for Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based task offloading in the IoWT. We
formulate the task offloading process considering the tradeoff between energy
consumption and task accomplishment time. Moreover, we model the task
offloading problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and utilize the
Q-learning technique to enable the wearable device to make optimal task
offloading decisions without prior knowledge. We evaluate the performance of
the proposed framework through extensive simulations for various applications
and system configurations conducted in the ns-3 network simulator. We also show
how varying the main system parameters of the Q-learning algorithm affects the
overall performance in terms of average task accomplishment time, average
energy consumption, and percentage of tasks offloaded.

TL;DR: PEAR is a benchmark for evaluating utility and vulnerability in planner-executor multi-agent systems, revealing key findings about performance degradation, memory importance, robustness trade-offs, and planner vulnerability to attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies on multi-agent systems examine isolated attack surfaces or specific scenarios, lacking holistic understanding of MAS vulnerabilities, which PEAR aims to address.

Method: Introduces PEAR benchmark for systematically evaluating planner-executor MAS, focusing on this widely adopted architecture through extensive experiments.

Result: Findings show: (1) weak planner degrades performance more than weak executor; (2) planner memory is essential but executor memory doesn't impact clean performance; (3) trade-off between performance and robustness; (4) attacks targeting planner are particularly effective.

Conclusion: These findings provide actionable insights for enhancing MAS robustness and lay groundwork for principled defenses in multi-agent settings.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have emerged as a
powerful paradigm for tackling complex, multi-step tasks across diverse
domains. However, despite their impressive capabilities, MAS remain susceptible
to adversarial manipulation. Existing studies typically examine isolated attack
surfaces or specific scenarios, leaving a lack of holistic understanding of MAS
vulnerabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce PEAR, a benchmark for
systematically evaluating both the utility and vulnerability of
planner-executor MAS. While compatible with various MAS architectures, our
benchmark focuses on the planner-executor structure, which is a practical and
widely adopted design. Through extensive experiments, we find that (1) a weak
planner degrades overall clean task performance more severely than a weak
executor; (2) while a memory module is essential for the planner, having a
memory module for the executor does not impact the clean task performance; (3)
there exists a trade-off between task performance and robustness; and (4)
attacks targeting the planner are particularly effective at misleading the
system. These findings offer actionable insights for enhancing the robustness
of MAS and lay the groundwork for principled defenses in multi-agent settings.

### [215] [MLLM4TS: Leveraging Vision and Multimodal Language Models for General Time-Series Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07513)
*Qinghua Liu,Sam Heshmati,Zheda Mai,Zubin Abraham,John Paparrizos,Liu Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MLLM4TS is a framework that bridges the modality gap between time-series data and natural language by using visual representations, enabling multimodal large language models to perform general time-series analysis tasks effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series analysis is challenging due to complex temporal dependencies and cross-channel interactions. Human analysts use visual inspection to uncover patterns, suggesting that visual representations could enhance automated analysis. However, existing multimodal LLMs struggle with the modality gap between continuous numerical time-series data and discrete natural language.

Method: MLLM4TS integrates a dedicated vision branch where each time-series channel is rendered as a horizontally stacked color-coded line plot in a composite image. It uses a temporal-aware visual patch alignment strategy to align visual patches with corresponding time segments, fusing fine-grained temporal details from numerical data with global contextual information from visual representations.

Result: Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show MLLM4TS is effective across both predictive tasks (classification) and generative tasks (anomaly detection and forecasting), demonstrating robust performance.

Conclusion: Integrating visual modalities with pretrained language models shows strong potential for achieving robust and generalizable time-series analysis, bridging the gap between numerical data and natural language understanding.

Abstract: Effective analysis of time series data presents significant challenges due to
the complex temporal dependencies and cross-channel interactions in
multivariate data. Inspired by the way human analysts visually inspect time
series to uncover hidden patterns, we ask: can incorporating visual
representations enhance automated time-series analysis? Recent advances in
multimodal large language models have demonstrated impressive generalization
and visual understanding capability, yet their application to time series
remains constrained by the modality gap between continuous numerical data and
discrete natural language. To bridge this gap, we introduce MLLM4TS, a novel
framework that leverages multimodal large language models for general
time-series analysis by integrating a dedicated vision branch. Each time-series
channel is rendered as a horizontally stacked color-coded line plot in one
composite image to capture spatial dependencies across channels, and a
temporal-aware visual patch alignment strategy then aligns visual patches with
their corresponding time segments. MLLM4TS fuses fine-grained temporal details
from the numerical data with global contextual information derived from the
visual representation, providing a unified foundation for multimodal
time-series analysis. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
the effectiveness of MLLM4TS across both predictive tasks (e.g.,
classification) and generative tasks (e.g., anomaly detection and forecasting).
These results underscore the potential of integrating visual modalities with
pretrained language models to achieve robust and generalizable time-series
analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate sleep stage classification is crucial for diagnosing sleep disorders, but conventional methods rely on manual annotation or basic EEG features that may miss important transient patterns.

Method: Proposes wavelet transform-based time-frequency analysis using continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to generate time-frequency maps capturing transient and oscillatory patterns across relevant frequency bands, combined with ensemble learning.

Result: Achieved 88.37% overall accuracy and 73.15 macro-averaged F1 score on Sleep-EDF Expanded Database, outperforming conventional machine learning methods and showing comparable or superior performance to recent deep learning approaches.

Conclusion: Wavelet analysis provides a robust, interpretable, and clinically applicable approach for sleep stage classification that captures important time-frequency characteristics missed by conventional methods.

Abstract: Accurate classification of sleep stages is crucial for the diagnosis and
management of sleep disorders. Conventional approaches for sleep scoring rely
on manual annotation or features extracted from EEG signals in the time or
frequency domain. This study proposes a novel framework for automated sleep
stage scoring using time-frequency analysis based on the wavelet transform. The
Sleep-EDF Expanded Database (sleep-cassette recordings) was used for
evaluation. The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) generated time-frequency
maps that capture both transient and oscillatory patterns across frequency
bands relevant to sleep staging. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed wavelet-based representation, combined with ensemble learning,
achieves an overall accuracy of 88.37 percent and a macro-averaged F1 score of
73.15, outperforming conventional machine learning methods and exhibiting
comparable or superior performance to recent deep learning approaches. These
findings highlight the potential of wavelet analysis for robust, interpretable,

TL;DR: A framework for creating targeted digital twins that model specific quantities of interest using memory-based flow map learning from short trajectory data bursts, enabling efficient long-term predictions without full system simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient prediction and analysis of specific quantities of interest in digital twins without the computational burden of running full system simulations.

Method: Uses memory-based flow map learning with short trajectory data bursts from repeated full digital twin executions to create data-driven models of quantities of interest.

Result: The method successfully creates compact dynamical systems that accurately predict long-term hydrodynamic forces on a cylinder in CFD simulations, bypassing full flow field computations.

Conclusion: The targeted digital twin framework provides substantial computational savings while maintaining accuracy for long-term predictions of specific quantities of interest.

Abstract: We present a numerical framework for constructing a targeted digital twin
(tDT) that directly models the dynamics of quantities of interest (QoIs) in a
full digital twin (DT). The proposed approach employs memory-based flow map
learning (FML) to develop a data-driven model of the QoIs using short bursts of
trajectory data generated through repeated executions of the full DT. This
renders the construction of the FML-based tDT an entirely offline computational
process. During online simulation, the learned tDT can efficiently predict and
analyze the long-term dynamics of the QoIs without requiring simulations of the
full DT system, thereby achieving substantial computational savings. After
introducing the general numerical procedure, we demonstrate the construction
and predictive capability of the tDT in a computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
example: two-dimensional incompressible flow past a cylinder. The QoIs in this
problem are the hydrodynamic forces exerted on the cylinder. The resulting tDTs
are compact dynamical systems that evolve these forces without explicit
knowledge of the underlying flow field. Numerical results show that the tDTs
yield accurate long-term predictions of the forces while entirely bypassing
full flow simulations.

*Lénaïc Chizat,Pierre Marion,Yerkin Yesbay*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dropout's theoretical behavior in large neural networks depends on learning rate and width scaling, with five distinct asymptotic phases. The penalty effect only occurs with impractically small learning rates, while larger rates make dropout equivalent to random gradient thinning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand dropout's role in large neural networks by studying its large-width asymptotics, as current understanding is limited despite its widespread use in training large language and vision models.

Method: Analyze gradient descent with dropout on two-layer neural networks using mean-field initialization scale. Study asymptotic behavior across different dropout rates, learning rates, and network widths to identify distinct phases.

Result: Identified five distinct nondegenerate asymptotic phases. Found that dropout's penalty effect only persists with impractically small learning rates (O(1/width)). For larger learning rates, dropout becomes equivalent to random gradient thinning. Limit dynamics described by mean-field jump process with independent Poisson/Bernoulli clocks.

Conclusion: Dropout's theoretical behavior is complex and depends on parameter scaling relationships. The study provides foundational understanding for dropout in large-scale networks and suggests the need to reconsider conventional explanations of dropout's mechanisms.

Abstract: Dropout is a standard training technique for neural networks that consists of
randomly deactivating units at each step of their gradient-based training. It
is known to improve performance in many settings, including in the large-scale
training of language or vision models. As a first step towards understanding
the role of dropout in large neural networks, we study the large-width
asymptotics of gradient descent with dropout on two-layer neural networks with
the mean-field initialization scale. We obtain a rich asymptotic phase diagram
that exhibits five distinct nondegenerate phases depending on the relative
magnitudes of the dropout rate, the learning rate, and the width. Notably, we
find that the well-studied "penalty" effect of dropout only persists in the
limit with impractically small learning rates of order $O(1/\text{width})$. For
larger learning rates, this effect disappears and in the limit, dropout is
equivalent to a "random geometry" technique, where the gradients are thinned
randomly after the forward and backward pass have been computed. In this
asymptotic regime, the limit is described by a mean-field jump process where
the neurons' update times follow independent Poisson or Bernoulli clocks
(depending on whether the learning rate vanishes or not). For some of the
phases, we obtain a description of the limit dynamics both in path-space and in
distribution-space. The convergence proofs involve a mix of tools from
mean-field particle systems and stochastic processes. Together, our results lay
the groundwork for a renewed theoretical understanding of dropout in
large-scale neural networks.

Conclusion: Findings provide insights for domain-specific fine-tuning and optimization strategies to improve real-world LLM performance and user satisfaction based on topic-specific model preferences.

Abstract: This study applies BERTopic, a transformer-based topic modeling technique, to
the lmsys-chat-1m dataset, a multilingual conversational corpus built from
head-to-head evaluations of large language models (LLMs). Each user prompt is
paired with two anonymized LLM responses and a human preference label, used to
assess user evaluation of competing model outputs. The main objective is
uncovering thematic patterns in these conversations and examining their
relation to user preferences, particularly if certain LLMs are consistently
preferred within specific topics. A robust preprocessing pipeline was designed
for multilingual variation, balancing dialogue turns, and cleaning noisy or
redacted data. BERTopic extracted over 29 coherent topics including artificial
intelligence, programming, ethics, and cloud infrastructure. We analysed
relationships between topics and model preferences to identify trends in
model-topic alignment. Visualization techniques included inter-topic distance

Conclusion: LOTUS is an effective first step toward unified model selection for multiple unsupervised ML tasks.

Abstract: In this work, we present LOTUS (Learning to Learn with Optimal Transport for

well on datasets with a similar underlying data distribution. We use Optimal
Transport distances to find this similarity between unlabeled tabular datasets
and recommend machine learning pipelines with one unified single method on two
downstream unsupervised tasks: outlier detection and clustering. We present the
effectiveness of our approach with experiments against strong baselines and
show that LOTUS is a very promising first step toward model selection for

*Ryan T. Tymkow,Benjamin D. Schnapp,Mojtaba Valipour,Ali Ghodshi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Symbolic Diffusion is a novel discrete diffusion model that simultaneously generates all tokens of mathematical expressions for symbolic regression, outperforming traditional autoregressive approaches in some metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models generate tokens left-to-right with limited conditioning on future tokens, which may limit expression quality. The authors want to generate all tokens simultaneously for better closed-form equations.

Method: Proposed Symbolic Diffusion - a D3PM based discrete state-space diffusion model that uses discrete token diffusion to generate all equation tokens at once, compared against SymbolicGPT's autoregressive approach.

Result: The diffusion-based approach showed comparable and sometimes improved performance over autoregressive generation in models with similar architectures on the bivariate dataset from SymbolicGPT.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based generation offers promising performance for symbolic regression and opens new research opportunities in neural-network based approaches to this problem.

Abstract: Symbolic regression refers to the task of finding a closed-form mathematical
expression to fit a set of data points. Genetic programming based techniques
are the most common algorithms used to tackle this problem, but recently,
neural-network based approaches have gained popularity. Most of the leading
neural-network based models used for symbolic regression utilize
transformer-based autoregressive models to generate an equation conditioned on
encoded input points. However, autoregressive generation is limited to
generating tokens left-to-right, and future generated tokens are conditioned
only on previously generated tokens. Motivated by the desire to generate all
tokens simultaneously to produce improved closed-form equations, we propose
Symbolic Diffusion, a D3PM based discrete state-space diffusion model which
simultaneously generates all tokens of the equation at once using discrete
token diffusion. Using the bivariate dataset developed for SymbolicGPT, we
compared our diffusion-based generation approach to an autoregressive model
based on SymbolicGPT, using equivalent encoder and transformer architectures.
We demonstrate that our novel approach of using diffusion-based generation for
symbolic regression can offer comparable and, by some metrics, improved
performance over autoregressive generation in models using similar underlying
architectures, opening new research opportunities in neural-network based

Abstract: This review aims to conduct a comparative analysis of liquid neural networks
(LNNs) and traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their variants,
such as long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and gated recurrent units
(GRUs). The core dimensions of the analysis include model accuracy, memory
efficiency, and generalization ability. By systematically reviewing existing
research, this paper explores the basic principles, mathematical models, key
characteristics, and inherent challenges of these neural network architectures
in processing sequential data. Research findings reveal that LNN, as an
emerging, biologically inspired, continuous-time dynamic neural network,
demonstrates significant potential in handling noisy, non-stationary data, and
achieving out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Additionally, some LNN
variants outperform traditional RNN in terms of parameter efficiency and
computational speed. However, RNN remains a cornerstone in sequence modeling
due to its mature ecosystem and successful applications across various tasks.
This review identifies the commonalities and differences between LNNs and RNNs,
summarizes their respective shortcomings and challenges, and points out
valuable directions for future research, particularly emphasizing the
importance of improving the scalability of LNNs to promote their application in
broader and more complex scenarios.

### [224] [Expanding the Action Space of LLMs to Reason Beyond Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07581)
*Zhongqi Yue,Weishi Wang,Yundaichuan Zhan,Juncheng Li,Daniel Dahlmeier,Fredrik D. Johansson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Expanded Action space (ExpA) to decouple environment interactions from language in LLMs, allowing models to switch between language reasoning and external environment actions without vocabulary constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs are limited to vocabulary tokens for environment interactions, requiring text parsing and routing to external interfaces, which overloads the model's language with both reasoning and control duties.

Method: Proposed Expanded Action space (ExpA) that internalizes environment interactions beyond vocabulary, with ExpA Reinforcement Learning (EARL) using counterfactual policy optimization to explore the expanded action space.

Result: EARL outperforms vocabulary-constrained baselines on multi-turn interaction tasks, achieves perfect Sort-4 accuracy in partially observed sorting problems, and self-discovers efficient algorithms competitive with classical designs.

Conclusion: Decoupling environment interactions from language through expanded action spaces enables more effective and robust LLM reasoning with external environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful reasoners in natural language, but
their actions are typically confined to outputting vocabulary tokens. As a
result, interactions with external environments -- such as symbolic operators
or simulators -- must be expressed through text in predefined formats, parsed,
and routed to external interfaces. This overloads the model's language with
both reasoning and control duties, and requires a hand-crafted parser, external
to the LLM. To address this, we decouple environment interactions from language
by internalizing them in an Expanded Action space (ExpA), beyond the
vocabulary. The model starts reasoning in the default language environment, but
may trigger routing actions and switch to an external environment at any time.
From there, the model can only invoke environment-specific actions, receive
feedback from the environment, and potentially route back to language as a
result. To promote effective exploration of the expanded action space and new
environments, we introduce ExpA Reinforcement Learning (EARL) with
counterfactual policy optimization. On tasks requiring multi-turn interactions
and contingent planning, EARL outperforms strong baselines with
vocabulary-constrained actions. It performs robustly across calculator-based
multi-task learning and, in the partially observed sorting problem, achieves
perfect Sort-4 accuracy while self-discovering an efficient algorithm
competitive with classical designs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TGM is a new open-source library that unifies continuous-time and discrete-time dynamic graph approaches, offering significant speed improvements and enabling new research possibilities in temporal graph machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing temporal graph libraries are fragmented, tailored to specific architectures, and create a divide between continuous-time and discrete-time approaches, hindering research progress and direct comparisons.

Method: TGM provides a unified framework for both continuous-time and discrete-time dynamic graphs, with first-class support for dynamic node features, time-granularity conversions, and native handling of link-, node-, and graph-level tasks.

Result: TGM achieves 7.8x average speedup over DyGLib and 175x speedup on graph discretization compared to available implementations, while enabling new research possibilities like dynamic graph property prediction and time-driven training paradigms.

Conclusion: TGM addresses critical infrastructure gaps in temporal graph ML, unifying previously divided approaches and enabling previously impractical research questions through improved efficiency and expanded capabilities.

Abstract: Well-designed open-source software drives progress in Machine Learning (ML)
research. While static graph ML enjoys mature frameworks like PyTorch Geometric
and DGL, ML for temporal graphs (TG), networks that evolve over time, lacks
comparable infrastructure. Existing TG libraries are often tailored to specific
architectures, hindering support for diverse models in this rapidly evolving
field. Additionally, the divide between continuous- and discrete-time dynamic
graph methods (CTDG and DTDG) limits direct comparisons and idea transfer. To
address these gaps, we introduce Temporal Graph Modelling (TGM), a
research-oriented library for ML on temporal graphs, the first to unify CTDG
and DTDG approaches. TGM offers first-class support for dynamic node features,
time-granularity conversions, and native handling of link-, node-, and
graph-level tasks. Empirically, TGM achieves an average 7.8x speedup across
multiple models, datasets, and tasks compared to the widely used DyGLib, and an
average 175x speedup on graph discretization relative to available
implementations. Beyond efficiency, we show in our experiments how TGM unlocks
entirely new research possibilities by enabling dynamic graph property
prediction and time-driven training paradigms, opening the door to questions
previously impractical to study. TGM is available at

### [226] [DGTEN: A Robust Deep Gaussian based Graph Neural Network for Dynamic Trust Evaluation with Uncertainty-Quantification Support](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07620)
*Muhammad Usman,Yugyung Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DGTEN is a unified graph framework for dynamic trust evaluation that combines uncertainty-aware message passing, temporal modeling, and built-in defenses against adversarial attacks, achieving significant improvements in trust prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic trust evaluation in rapidly evolving graphs requires models that can capture changing relationships, express calibrated confidence, and resist adversarial manipulation.

Method: Combines Gaussian-based uncertainty-aware message passing, hybrid Absolute-Gaussian-Hourglass positional encoding with Kolmogorov-Arnold network-based attention, ODE-based residual learning for temporal modeling, and robust adaptive ensemble coefficient analysis for defense.

Result: On Bitcoin trust networks: 10.77% MCC improvement in single-timeslot prediction, 16.41% MCC gain in cold-start scenario, and up to 11.63% MCC improvement under adversarial attacks compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The unified DGTEN framework effectively addresses dynamic trust evaluation challenges with uncertainty modeling, temporal evolution capture, and adversarial resistance.

Abstract: Dynamic trust evaluation in large, rapidly evolving graphs requires models
that can capture changing relationships, express calibrated confidence, and
resist adversarial manipulation. DGTEN (Deep Gaussian-based Trust Evaluation
Network) introduces a unified graph framework that achieves all three by
combining uncertainty-aware message passing, expressive temporal modeling, and
built-in defenses against trust-targeted attacks. It represents nodes and edges
as Gaussian distributions so that both semantic signals and epistemic
uncertainty propagate through the graph neural network, enabling risk-aware
trust decisions rather than overconfident guesses. To model how trust evolves,
it employs hybrid Absolute-Gaussian-Hourglass (HAGH) positional encoding with
Kolmogorov-Arnold network-based unbiased multi-head attention, followed by an
ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based residual learning module to jointly
capture abrupt shifts and smooth trends. Robust adaptive ensemble coefficient
analysis prunes or down-weights suspicious interactions using complementary
cosine and Jaccard similarity measures, mitigating reputation laundering,
sabotage, and on/off attacks. On two signed Bitcoin trust networks, DGTEN
delivers significant improvements: in single-timeslot prediction on
Bitcoin-Alpha, it improves MCC by 10.77% over the best dynamic baseline; in the
cold-start scenario, it achieves a 16.41% MCC gain - the largest across all
tasks and datasets. Under adversarial on/off attacks, it surpasses the baseline
by up to 11.63% MCC. These results validate the effectiveness of the unified
DGTEN framework.

*Chongyu Fan,Changsheng Wang,Yancheng Huang,Soumyadeep Pal,Sijia Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of machine unlearning methods for LLMs, introducing a taxonomy of 12 stateful unlearning approaches and proposing improved evaluation metrics through open QA to better assess the UE-UT tradeoff.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM unlearning research is fragmented with unclear evaluation standards, often overstating success through limited MCQ-based metrics that don't capture actual generative behavior.

Method: Developed a principled taxonomy of 12 stateful unlearning methods grouped into three families: divergence-driven optimization, representation misalignment, and rejection-based targeted unlearning. Introduced open QA metrics for better evaluation.

Result: Analysis revealed that current MCQ-dominated evaluations offer narrow perspectives and overstate success. Open QA metrics better capture generative performance and reveal the inherent UE-UT tradeoff across method families. Also found that robustness requires finer-grained analysis of different attack types.

Conclusion: The study provides a full-stack revisit of LLM unlearning with actionable guidance for designing and evaluating future methods, emphasizing the need for comprehensive evaluation beyond MCQ accuracy to properly assess the UE-UT tradeoff.

Abstract: Machine unlearning for large language models (LLMs) aims to remove undesired
data, knowledge, and behaviors (e.g., for safety, privacy, or copyright) while
preserving useful model capabilities. Despite rapid progress over the past two
years, research in LLM unlearning remains fragmented, with limited clarity on
what constitutes effective unlearning and how it should be rigorously
evaluated. In this work, we present a principled taxonomy of twelve recent
stateful unlearning methods, grouped into three methodological families:
divergence-driven optimization, representation misalignment, and
rejection-based targeted unlearning. Building on this taxonomy, we revisit the
evaluation of unlearning effectiveness (UE), utility retention (UT), and
robustness (Rob), focusing on the WMDP benchmark. Our analysis shows that
current evaluations, dominated by multiple-choice question (MCQ) accuracy,
offer only a narrow perspective, often overstating success while overlooking
the model's actual generation behavior. To address this gap, we introduce open
question-answering (Open-QA) metrics that better capture generative performance
and reveal the inherent UE-UT tradeoff across method families. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that robustness requires finer-grained analysis: for example,
vulnerabilities differ substantially between in-domain relearning and
out-of-domain fine-tuning, even though both fall under model-level attacks.
Through this study, we hope to deliver a full-stack revisit of LLM unlearning
and actionable guidance for designing and evaluating future methods.

*Zichen Wang,Haoyang Hong,Chuanhao Li,Haoxuan Li,Zhiheng Zhang,Huazheng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper establishes the first theoretical Pareto frontier for the trade-off between regret minimization and inference accuracy in adversarial multi-armed bandits with network interference (MABNI), and introduces an algorithm called EXP3-N-CS with anytime-valid asymptotic confidence sequences to balance this trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MABNI research focuses primarily on minimizing regret but overlooks the problem that excessive emphasis on optimal arms can undermine inference accuracy for sub-optimal arms. This trade-off becomes more pronounced in network interference settings.

Method: The authors establish a theoretical Pareto frontier for the regret-inference accuracy trade-off in adversarial MABNI, and develop the EXP3-N-CS algorithm with anytime-valid asymptotic confidence sequences to balance this trade-off.

Result: The paper provides the first theoretical characterization of the Pareto frontier between regret minimization and inference accuracy in adversarial MABNI settings, along with a practical algorithm to achieve this balance.

Conclusion: This work addresses the critical trade-off between exploration-exploitation (regret minimization) and inference accuracy in network bandits, providing both theoretical foundations and practical algorithmic solutions for balanced performance in adversarial MABNI scenarios.

Abstract: In multi-armed bandits with network interference (MABNI), the action taken by
one node can influence the rewards of others, creating complex interdependence.
While existing research on MABNI largely concentrates on minimizing regret, it
often overlooks the crucial concern that an excessive emphasis on the optimal
arm can undermine the inference accuracy for sub-optimal arms. Although initial
efforts have been made to address this trade-off in single-unit scenarios,
these challenges have become more pronounced in the context of MABNI. In this
paper, we establish, for the first time, a theoretical Pareto frontier
characterizing the trade-off between regret minimization and inference accuracy
in adversarial (design-based) MABNI. We further introduce an anytime-valid
asymptotic confidence sequence along with a corresponding algorithm,
$\texttt{EXP3-N-CS}$, specifically designed to balance the trade-off between
regret minimization and inference accuracy in this setting.

### [230] [Continual Learning for Adaptive AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07648)
*Md Hasibul Amin,Tamzid Tanvi Alam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel regularization technique called inter-cluster separation (ICS) is introduced to prevent catastrophic forgetting in continual learning by penalizing outputs far from previous task centroids.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continual learning faces the challenge of catastrophic forgetting where neural networks lose previously learned knowledge when training on new tasks. Deep learning models suffer from overfitting, and regularization can help address this issue.

Method: Proposed ICS regularization in the loss function that penalizes outputs distant from centroids of clusters from previous tasks. Performed hyperparameter tuning for optimal regularization weighting to ensure clear task separation in internal representations.

Result: ICS demonstrated effectiveness on 5-task Split CIFAR-10 benchmark with ResNet-18, maintaining strong performance on initial tasks. However, limitations were observed in long-term knowledge retention as task numbers increased.

Conclusion: The approach highlights the complexity and trade-offs in continual learning, showing promise but also revealing challenges in long-term retention that require further research.

Abstract: Continual learning the ability of a neural network to learn multiple
sequential tasks without losing previously acquired knowledge remains a
significant obstacle to developing truly adaptive artificial intelligence. Deep
learning models have achieved remarkable results in various applications, but
overfitting remains a common issue. Regularization techniques can help prevent
overfitting by adding constraints to the model's parameters. To prevent
catastrophic forgetting, in this paper we introduce a novel regularization
technique based on inter-cluster separation (ICS) in the loss function, which
penalizes the model for producing outputs that are far away from the centroids
of the clusters formed by the data from previous tasks. We also performed
hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal weighting of the proposed
regularization term. This ensures clearer separation between tasks in the
neural network's internal representation, reducing overlap and mitigating
forgetting. Using the standard 5-task Split CIFAR-10 benchmark and a ResNet-18
architecture, we demonstrate ICS's effectiveness in maintaining strong
performance on initial tasks. However, our results also highlight limitations
in long-term knowledge retention, particularly when the number of tasks
increases. This underscores the complexity and trade-offs inherent in continual
learning and points toward avenues for further research.

*Perry Dong,Chongyi Zheng,Chelsea Finn,Dorsa Sadigh,Benjamin Eysenbach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Value Flows uses flow-based models to estimate full future return distributions in RL, enabling better uncertainty estimation and achieving 1.3× improvement in success rates across 62 benchmark tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current distributional RL methods use categorical distributions or quantiles, which don't capture fine-grained return structure or effectively distinguish states with high return uncertainty for decision-making.

Method: Proposes flow-matching objective that generates probability density paths satisfying the distributional Bellman equation, and uses flow derivative ODE to estimate return uncertainty of states.

Result: Achieves 1.3× improvement on average in success rates across 37 state-based and 25 image-based benchmark tasks in offline and online-to-online settings.

Conclusion: Flow-based models provide superior return distribution estimation and uncertainty quantification, leading to significant performance improvements in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: While most reinforcement learning methods today flatten the distribution of
future returns to a single scalar value, distributional RL methods exploit the
return distribution to provide stronger learning signals and to enable
applications in exploration and safe RL. While the predominant method for
estimating the return distribution is by modeling it as a categorical
distribution over discrete bins or estimating a finite number of quantiles,
such approaches leave unanswered questions about the fine-grained structure of
the return distribution and about how to distinguish states with high return
uncertainty for decision-making. The key idea in this paper is to use modern,
flexible flow-based models to estimate the full future return distributions and
identify those states with high return variance. We do so by formulating a new
flow-matching objective that generates probability density paths satisfying the
distributional Bellman equation. Building upon the learned flow models, we
estimate the return uncertainty of distinct states using a new flow derivative
ODE. We additionally use this uncertainty information to prioritize learning a
more accurate return estimation on certain transitions. We compare our method
(Value Flows) with prior methods in the offline and online-to-online settings.
Experiments on $37$ state-based and $25$ image-based benchmark tasks
demonstrate that Value Flows achieves a $1.3\times$ improvement on average in
success rates. Website: https://pd-perry.github.io/value-flows Code:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedQS is a novel framework that addresses aggregation strategy disparities in semi-asynchronous federated learning by classifying clients into four types and adaptively optimizing their training, achieving superior accuracy, stability, and convergence speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semi-asynchronous FL faces challenges in optimizing gradient-based and model-based aggregation strategies, which have distinct trade-offs in accuracy, convergence speed, and stability. There's a need to bridge the gap between these strategies.

Method: FedQS uses a divide-and-conquer strategy that classifies clients into four distinct types based on data distribution and computational resources, then adaptively optimizes their local training.

Result: Extensive experiments show FedQS achieves the highest accuracy, lowest loss, and ranks among the fastest in convergence speed, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines across computer vision, NLP, and real-world tasks.

Conclusion: FedQS bridges the gap between aggregation strategies in semi-asynchronous FL, providing a unified solution for stable, accurate, and efficient federated learning.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple
parties without sharing raw data, with semi-asynchronous FL (SAFL) emerging as
a balanced approach between synchronous and asynchronous FL. However, SAFL
faces significant challenges in optimizing both gradient-based (e.g., FedSGD)
and model-based (e.g., FedAvg) aggregation strategies, which exhibit distinct
trade-offs in accuracy, convergence speed, and stability. While gradient
aggregation achieves faster convergence and higher accuracy, it suffers from
pronounced fluctuations, whereas model aggregation offers greater stability but
slower convergence and suboptimal accuracy. This paper presents FedQS, the
first framework to theoretically analyze and address these disparities in SAFL.
FedQS introduces a divide-and-conquer strategy to handle client heterogeneity
by classifying clients into four distinct types and adaptively optimizing their
local training based on data distribution characteristics and available
computational resources. Extensive experiments on computer vision, natural
language processing, and real-world tasks demonstrate that FedQS achieves the
highest accuracy, attains the lowest loss, and ranks among the fastest in
convergence speed, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Our work bridges
the gap between aggregation strategies in SAFL, offering a unified solution for
stable, accurate, and efficient federated learning. The code and datasets are

Motivation: High-latency Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are unsuitable for real-time responses in AI-powered e-commerce livestreaming where digital avatars need immediate engagement. There's a need to bridge the gap between computational efficiency and reasoning quality.

Led to statistically significant increase in Gross Merchandise Volume when tested by hundreds of thousands of viewers.

Conclusion: LiveThinking effectively enhances user experience and commercial performance in live, interactive e-commerce settings by balancing computational efficiency with reasoning quality through distillation and reasoning path compression.

Abstract: In AI-powered e-commerce livestreaming, digital avatars require real-time
responses to drive engagement, a task for which high-latency Large Reasoning
Models (LRMs) are ill-suited. We introduce LiveThinking, a practical two-stage
optimization framework to bridge this gap. First, we address computational cost
by distilling a 670B teacher LRM into a lightweight 30B Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) model (3B active) using Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT). This
reduces deployment overhead but preserves the teacher's verbose reasoning,
causing latency. To solve this, our second stage employs reinforcement learning
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to compress the model's
reasoning path, guided by a multi-objective reward function balancing
correctness, helpfulness, and brevity. LiveThinking achieves a 30-fold
reduction in computational cost, enabling sub-second latency. In real-world
application on Taobao Live, it improved response correctness by 3.3% and
helpfulness by 21.8%. Tested by hundreds of thousands of viewers, our system
led to a statistically significant increase in Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV),
demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing user experience and commercial
performance in live, interactive settings.

TL;DR: GRFs++ is an improved version of Graph Random Features that addresses limitations of regular GRFs by using walk-stitching to model distant node relationships more efficiently and extending walk termination to general distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of regular GRFs, particularly difficulty in modeling relationships between distant nodes and inefficient long walk sampling.

Method: Uses walk-stitching technique to concatenate shorter walks without breaking unbiasedness, and extends walk termination from fixed Bernoulli schemes to general distributions on walk lengths.

Result: GRFs++ achieve approximation quality of longer walks with greater efficiency through parallel computation of short walks and matrix-matrix multiplication.

Conclusion: GRFs++ provide improved approximation accuracy for graph kernels without extra computational cost, as validated by empirical evaluations and theoretical analysis.

Abstract: We propose refined GRFs (GRFs++), a new class of Graph Random Features (GRFs)
for efficient and accurate computations involving kernels defined on the nodes
of a graph. GRFs++ resolve some of the long-standing limitations of regular
GRFs, including difficulty modeling relationships between more distant nodes.
They reduce dependence on sampling long graph random walks via a novel
walk-stitching technique, concatenating several shorter walks without breaking
unbiasedness. By applying these techniques, GRFs++ inherit the approximation
quality provided by longer walks but with greater efficiency, trading
sequential, inefficient sampling of a long walk for parallel computation of
short walks and matrix-matrix multiplication. Furthermore, GRFs++ extend the
simplistic GRFs walk termination mechanism (Bernoulli schemes with fixed
halting probabilities) to a broader class of strategies, applying general
distributions on the walks' lengths. This improves the approximation accuracy
of graph kernels, without incurring extra computational cost. We provide
empirical evaluations to showcase all our claims and complement our results
with theoretical analysis.

TL;DR: DEAS is an offline RL framework that uses action sequences for value learning, addressing value overestimation through detached value learning and achieving superior performance on complex long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current offline RL approaches struggle with complex, long-horizon sequential decision making, despite the attractive paradigm of training agents without expensive online interactions.

Method: DEAS leverages action sequences for value learning, interpreting them through the options framework via semi-Markov decision process Q-learning, and uses detached value learning to address value overestimation by steering estimates toward in-distribution high-return actions.

Result: DEAS consistently outperforms baselines on complex long-horizon tasks from OGBench and significantly boosts performance of large-scale Vision-Language-Action models in both RoboCasa Kitchen simulation and real-world manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: DEAS provides an effective offline RL framework that successfully handles complex long-horizon tasks by leveraging action sequences and addressing value overestimation through detached value learning.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) presents an attractive paradigm for
training intelligent agents without expensive online interactions. However,
current approaches still struggle with complex, long-horizon sequential
decision making. In this work, we introduce DEtached value learning with Action
Sequence (DEAS), a simple yet effective offline RL framework that leverages
action sequences for value learning. These temporally extended actions provide
richer information than single-step actions and can be interpreted through the
options framework via semi-Markov decision process Q-learning, enabling
reduction of the effective planning horizon by considering longer sequences at
once. However, directly adopting such sequences in actor-critic algorithms
introduces excessive value overestimation, which we address through detached
value learning that steers value estimates toward in-distribution actions that
achieve high return in the offline dataset. We demonstrate that DEAS
consistently outperforms baselines on complex, long-horizon tasks from OGBench
and can be applied to enhance the performance of large-scale
Vision-Language-Action models that predict action sequences, significantly
boosting performance in both RoboCasa Kitchen simulation tasks and real-world
manipulation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High collection costs and privacy concerns prevent access to large-scale LBSN trajectory data needed for applications like POI recommendation and pandemic intervention.

Method: Two-stage coarse-to-fine framework: 1) Sparsity-aware Spatio-temporal Diffusion model (S²TDiff) learns behavioral patterns from latent movement sequences, 2) Transformer-based Coarse2FineNet with dynamic context fusion and multi-task decoder generates fine-grained trajectories.

Result: GeoGen outperforms state-of-the-art models on four real-world datasets, achieving over 69% and 55% improvements in distance and radius metrics on FS-TKY dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed GeoGen framework effectively generates synthetic LBSN trajectories while preserving data characteristics and ensuring privacy protection.

Abstract: Location-Based Social Network (LBSN) check-in trajectory data are important
for many practical applications, like POI recommendation, advertising, and
pandemic intervention. However, the high collection costs and ever-increasing
privacy concerns prevent us from accessing large-scale LBSN trajectory data.
The recent advances in synthetic data generation provide us with a new
opportunity to achieve this, which utilizes generative AI to generate synthetic
data that preserves the characteristics of real data while ensuring privacy
protection. However, generating synthetic LBSN check-in trajectories remains
challenging due to their spatially discrete, temporally irregular nature and
the complex spatio-temporal patterns caused by sparse activities and uncertain
human mobility. To address this challenge, we propose GeoGen, a two-stage
coarse-to-fine framework for large-scale LBSN check-in trajectory generation.
In the first stage, we reconstruct spatially continuous, temporally regular
latent movement sequences from the original LBSN check-in trajectories and then
design a Sparsity-aware Spatio-temporal Diffusion model (S$^2$TDiff) with an
efficient denosing network to learn their underlying behavioral patterns. In
the second stage, we design Coarse2FineNet, a Transformer-based Seq2Seq
architecture equipped with a dynamic context fusion mechanism in the encoder
and a multi-task hybrid-head decoder, which generates fine-grained LBSN
trajectories based on coarse-grained latent movement sequences by modeling
semantic relevance and behavioral uncertainty. Extensive experiments on four
real-world datasets show that GeoGen excels state-of-the-art models for both
fidelity and utility evaluation, e.g., it increases over 69% and 55% in
distance and radius metrics on the FS-TKY dataset.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MeSH addresses bottlenecks in recursive transformers by externalizing state management into memory buffers and using routers to diversify computation, improving performance over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recursive transformers with fewer parameters underperform non-recursive counterparts due to undifferentiated computation and information overload in hidden states.

Method: Introduces Memory-as-State-Highways (MeSH) scheme with explicit memory buffers and lightweight routers to dynamically diversify computation across iterations.

Result: MeSH-enhanced recursive transformers outperform recursive baselines and larger non-recursive models at 1.4B scale, improving downstream accuracy by +1.06% with 33% fewer parameters.

Conclusion: MeSH provides a scalable and principled architecture for building stronger recursive models by resolving computational pathologies through functional specialization.

Abstract: Recursive transformers reuse parameters and iterate over hidden states
multiple times, decoupling compute depth from parameter depth. However, under
matched compute, recursive models with fewer parameters often lag behind
non-recursive counterparts. By probing hidden states, we trace this performance
gap to two primary bottlenecks: undifferentiated computation, where the core is
forced to adopt a similar computational pattern at every iteration, and
information overload, where long-lived and transient information must coexist
in a single hidden state. To address the issues, we introduce a
Memory-as-State-Highways (MeSH) scheme, which externalizes state management
into an explicit memory buffer and employs lightweight routers to dynamically
diversify computation across iterations. Probing visualizations confirm that
MeSH successfully resolves the pathologies by inducing functional
specialization across iterations. On the Pythia suite (160M-1.4B),
MeSH-enhanced recursive transformers consistently improve over recursive
baselines and outperforms its larger non-recursive counterpart at the 1.4B
scale, improving average downstream accuracy by +1.06% with 33% fewer
non-embedding parameters. Our analysis establishes MeSH as a scalable and
principled architecture for building stronger recursive models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: t-SNE visualizations cannot reliably indicate input clustering strength or outlier extremity, contrary to common belief.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the widespread conviction that t-SNE produces visualizations that accurately reflect input data structure, particularly clustering strength and outlier detection.

Method: Theoretical proof and practical demonstrations showing failure modes where t-SNE output misrepresents input clustering strength and outlier characteristics.

Result: Proved that (1) input clustering strength and (2) outlier extremity cannot be reliably inferred from t-SNE visualizations, with practical examples showing these failures occur commonly.

Conclusion: t-SNE visualizations should not be trusted for assessing clustering strength or identifying outliers, as they systematically misrepresent these aspects of the input data structure.

Abstract: Central to the widespread use of t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding
(t-SNE) is the conviction that it produces visualizations whose structure
roughly matches that of the input. To the contrary, we prove that (1) the
strength of the input clustering, and (2) the extremity of outlier points,
cannot be reliably inferred from the t-SNE output. We demonstrate the
prevalence of these failure modes in practice as well.

*Zhengyu Wu,Yinlin Zhu,Xunkai Li,Ziang Qiu,Rong-Hua Li,Guoren Wang,Chenghu Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedBook is a federated graph foundation model codebook that addresses privacy constraints by creating a robust global codebook through intra-domain collaboration and inter-domain integration, outperforming 21 baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph foundation models require centralized access to multi-domain graphs, which is often infeasible due to privacy and institutional constraints. Federated approaches need robust global codebooks that balance intra-domain coherence and inter-domain diversity.

Method: FedBook uses a two-phase process: (1) Intra-domain Collaboration - refines low-frequency tokens using high-frequency tokens across clients for domain-specific coherence; (2) Inter-domain Integration - weights client contributions by semantic distinctiveness during global aggregation to preserve cross-domain diversity.

Result: Extensive experiments on 8 benchmarks across multiple domains and tasks show FedBook consistently outperforms 21 baselines including isolated supervised learning, FL/FGL, federated adaptations of centralized GFMs, and FedGFM techniques.

Conclusion: FedBook successfully addresses the limitations of centralized graph foundation models by enabling effective federated pre-training while maintaining both intra-domain coherence and inter-domain diversity, demonstrating superior performance across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable cross-domain generalization in
language and vision, inspiring the development of graph foundation models
(GFMs). However, existing GFMs typically assume centralized access to
multi-domain graphs, which is often infeasible due to privacy and institutional
constraints. Federated Graph Foundation Models (FedGFMs) address this
limitation, but their effectiveness fundamentally hinges on constructing a
robust global codebook that achieves intra-domain coherence by consolidating
mutually reinforcing semantics within each domain, while also maintaining
inter-domain diversity by retaining heterogeneous knowledge across domains. To
this end, we propose FedBook, a unified federated graph foundation codebook
that systematically aggregates clients' local codebooks during server-side
federated pre-training. FedBook follows a two-phase process: (1) Intra-domain
Collaboration, where low-frequency tokens are refined by referencing more
semantically reliable high-frequency tokens across clients to enhance
domain-specific coherence; and (2) Inter-domain Integration, where client
contributions are weighted by the semantic distinctiveness of their codebooks
during the aggregation of the global GFM, thereby preserving cross-domain
diversity. Extensive experiments on 8 benchmarks across multiple domains and
tasks demonstrate that FedBook consistently outperforms 21 baselines, including
isolated supervised learning, FL/FGL, federated adaptations of centralized
GFMs, and FedGFM techniques.

### [241] [Rényi Sharpness: A Novel Sharpness that Strongly Correlates with Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07758)
*Qiaozhe Zhang,Jun Sun,Ruijie Zhang,Yingzhuang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Rényi sharpness as a new measure for neural network generalization based on Rényi entropy of loss Hessian eigenvalues, showing stronger correlation with generalization than existing measures and introducing RSAM regularization that outperforms SAM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sharpness measures show weak correlation with generalization despite the intuition that flatter minima generalize better. The gap between this intuition and reality needs to be addressed.

Method: Define Rényi sharpness as negative Rényi entropy of loss Hessian eigenvalues, use reparametrization invariance and weight perturbation techniques for generalization bounds, and develop RSAM as a regularization method.

Result: Strong correlation between Rényi sharpness and generalization verified through Kendall rank correlation. RSAM achieves up to 2.5% test accuracy improvement over classical SAM method.

Conclusion: Rényi sharpness effectively captures generalization properties and RSAM regularization significantly improves model performance, demonstrating the practical value of the proposed measure.

Abstract: Sharpness (of the loss minima) is a common measure to investigate the
generalization of neural networks. Intuitively speaking, the flatter the
landscape near the minima is, the better generalization might be.
Unfortunately, the correlation between many existing sharpness measures and the
generalization is usually not strong, sometimes even weak. To close the gap
between the intuition and the reality, we propose a novel sharpness measure,
i.e., \textit{R\'enyi sharpness}, which is defined as the negative R\'enyi
entropy (a generalization of the classical Shannon entropy) of the loss
Hessian. The main ideas are as follows: 1) we realize that \textit{uniform}
(identical) eigenvalues of the loss Hessian is most desirable (while keeping
the sum constant) to achieve good generalization; 2) we employ the
\textit{R\'enyi entropy} to concisely characterize the extent of the spread of
the eigenvalues of loss Hessian. Normally, the larger the spread, the smaller
the (R\'enyi) entropy. To rigorously establish the relationship between
generalization and (R\'enyi) sharpness, we provide several generalization
bounds in terms of R\'enyi sharpness, by taking advantage of the
reparametrization invariance property of R\'enyi sharpness, as well as the
trick of translating the data discrepancy to the weight perturbation.
Furthermore, extensive experiments are conducted to verify the strong
correlation (in specific, Kendall rank correlation) between the R\'enyi
sharpness and generalization. Moreover, we propose to use a variant of R\'enyi
Sharpness as regularizer during training, i.e., R\'enyi Sharpness Aware
Minimization (RSAM), which turns out to outperform all existing sharpness-aware
minimization methods. It is worthy noting that the test accuracy gain of our
proposed RSAM method could be as high as nearly 2.5\%, compared against the
classical SAM method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VAMO is a multi-task optimization method for online advertising that assigns task weights based on validation gradient alignment, improving generalization in volatile bidding environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterogeneous advertiser requirements create many independent bidding tasks with extensive computation and limited data efficiency. Existing multi-task methods guided by training dynamics generalize poorly in volatile bidding environments.

Method: Validation-Aligned Multi-task Optimization (VAMO) adaptively assigns task weights based on alignment between training gradients and held-out validation gradient. Includes periodicity-aware temporal module and generative auto-bidding backbone for cross-task transfer of seasonal patterns.

Result: Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world advertising systems show significant improvements over typical baselines, demonstrating effectiveness in volatile bidding environments.

Conclusion: VAMO effectively addresses multi-task optimization in online advertising by steering updates toward validation improvement and better matching deployment objectives, with theoretical guarantees and practical performance gains.

Abstract: In online advertising, heterogeneous advertiser requirements give rise to
numerous customized bidding tasks that are typically optimized independently,
resulting in extensive computation and limited data efficiency. Multi-task
learning offers a principled framework to train these tasks jointly through
shared representations. However, existing multi-task optimization strategies
are primarily guided by training dynamics and often generalize poorly in
volatile bidding environments. To this end, we present Validation-Aligned
Multi-task Optimization (VAMO), which adaptively assigns task weights based on
the alignment between per-task training gradients and a held-out validation
gradient, thereby steering updates toward validation improvement and better
matching deployment objectives. We further equip the framework with a
periodicity-aware temporal module and couple it with an advanced generative
auto-bidding backbone to enhance cross-task transfer of seasonal structure and
strengthen bidding performance. Meanwhile, we provide theoretical insights into
the proposed method, e.g., convergence guarantee and alignment analysis.
Extensive experiments on both simulated and large-scale real-world advertising
systems consistently demonstrate significant improvements over typical
baselines, illuminating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

*Linping Qu,Shenghui Song,Chi-Ying Tsui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a layer-wise adaptive modulation scheme for wireless federated learning that assigns different modulation levels to different DNN layers based on their importance, achieving up to 73.9% communication latency reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In wireless FL, transmitting high-dimensional DNN parameters through bandwidth-limited channels causes significant communication latency issues. Existing schemes use uniform modulation for all layers, which is inefficient.

Method: Developed a layer-wise adaptive modulation scheme that automatically determines optimal modulation levels for different DNN layers based on their importance, providing more flexibility to reduce latency.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate the proposed scheme can save up to 73.9% of communication latency compared to existing uniform modulation schemes.

Conclusion: The layer-wise adaptive modulation approach effectively addresses communication latency in wireless FL by optimizing modulation levels per layer rather than using uniform modulation across all layers.

Abstract: In wireless federated learning (FL), the clients need to transmit the
high-dimensional deep neural network (DNN) parameters through bandwidth-limited
channels, which causes the communication latency issue. In this paper, we
propose a layer-wise adaptive modulation scheme to save the communication
latency. Unlike existing works which assign the same modulation level for all
DNN layers, we consider the layers' importance which provides more freedom to
save the latency. The proposed scheme can automatically decide the optimal
modulation levels for different DNN layers. Experimental results show that the
proposed scheme can save up to 73.9% of communication latency compared with the
existing schemes.

TL;DR: This paper extends weak-form equation learning techniques with kernel density estimation to model lepidopteran larval movement from sparse experimental data, specifically fall armyworms in simulated agricultural conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding insect movement patterns driven by infection, predation, and environmental factors can improve forecasting of pest outbreaks and enable better pest management strategies.

Method: Extends weak-form equation learning techniques (WSINDy algorithm) coupled with kernel density estimation to learn Fokker-Planck equations from sparse position measurements of fall armyworms in varied agricultural conditions.

Result: The method successfully learns effective models for lepidopteran larval population movement from highly sparse experimental data.

Conclusion: Weak-form equation learning techniques are useful for understanding and predicting insect dispersal dynamics, particularly for crop and silvicultural pests, leading to improved outbreak forecasting and management.

Abstract: Insect species subject to infection, predation, and anisotropic environmental
conditions may exhibit preferential movement patterns. Given the innate
stochasticity of exogenous factors driving these patterns over short
timescales, individual insect trajectories typically obey overdamped stochastic
dynamics. In practice, data-driven modeling approaches designed to learn the
underlying Fokker-Planck equations from observed insect distributions serve as
ideal tools for understanding and predicting such behavior. Understanding
dispersal dynamics of crop and silvicultural pests can lead to a better
forecasting of outbreak intensity and location, which can result in better pest
management. In this work, we extend weak-form equation learning techniques,
coupled with kernel density estimation, to learn effective models for
lepidopteran larval population movement from highly sparse experimental data.
Galerkin methods such as the Weak form Sparse Identification of Nonlinear
Dynamics (WSINDy) algorithm have recently proven useful for learning governing
equations in several scientific contexts. We demonstrate the utility of the
method on a sparse dataset of position measurements of fall armyworms
(Spodoptera frugiperda) obtained in simulated agricultural conditions with
varied plant resources and infection status.

TL;DR: HySim-LLM is a framework that improves LLM performance on pharmacokinetic data through embedding-weighted fine-tuning and manifold-aware denoising, with theoretical guarantees for adaptation and noise reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extracting and standardizing pharmacokinetic information from literature is challenging due to data heterogeneity, noise, and domain shift, limiting reliable data-driven models in drug development.

Method: Proposes HySim-LLM framework with embedding-weighted fine-tuning and manifold-aware denoising, supported by theoretical generalization bounds and denoising guarantees.

Result: The framework provides principled foundation for fine-tuning LLMs in structured biomedical settings with theoretical performance guarantees under embedding divergence and noise conditions.

Conclusion: HySim-LLM offers a mathematically grounded pathway for reliable and interpretable LLM adaptation in biomedical and data-intensive scientific domains.

Abstract: The extraction and standardization of pharmacokinetic (PK) information from
scientific literature remain significant challenges in computational
pharmacology, which limits the reliability of data-driven models in drug
development. Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
text understanding and reasoning, yet their adaptation to structured biomedical
data, such as PK tables, remains constrained by heterogeneity, noise, and
domain shift. To address these limitations, we propose HySim-LLM, a unified
mathematical and computational framework that integrates embedding-weighted
fine-tuning and manifold-aware denoising to enhance the robustness and
interpretability of LLMs. We establish two theoretical results: (1) a
similarity-weighted generalization bound that quantifies adaptation performance
under embedding divergence, and (2) a manifold-based denoising guarantee that
bounds loss contributions from noisy or off-manifold samples. These theorems
provide a principled foundation for fine-tuning LLMs in structured biomedical
settings. The framework offers a mathematically grounded pathway toward
reliable and interpretable LLM adaptation for biomedical and data-intensive
scientific domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SIMU is a two-step machine unlearning framework that selectively updates only critical neurons responsible for encoding forget-set information, achieving effective unlearning while better preserving model's original capabilities compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine unlearning methods for LLMs often compromise the model's original knowledge and utility when removing sensitive information, creating a need for more selective approaches.

Method: A two-step framework that enhances second-order optimizer-based unlearning by selectively updating only the critical neurons responsible for encoding the forget-set information, rather than broadly updating the model.

Result: SIMU achieves comparable unlearning efficacy while substantially outperforming current methods in retaining the model's original knowledge and overall utility.

Conclusion: Selective neuron updates provide an effective approach to machine unlearning that balances the removal of sensitive information with preservation of model capabilities, addressing key limitations of existing unlearning techniques.

Abstract: The undesired memorization of sensitive information by Large Language Models
(LLMs) has emphasized the need for safety mechanisms that can regulate model
behavior. This has led to the development of machine unlearning techniques that
enable models to precisely forget sensitive and unwanted information. For
machine unlearning, first-order and second-order optimizer-based methods have
shown significant progress in enabling LLMs to forget targeted information.
However, in doing so, these approaches often compromise the model's original
capabilities, resulting in unlearned models that struggle to retain their prior
knowledge and overall utility. To address this, we propose Selective Influence
Machine Unlearning (SIMU), a two-step framework that enhances second-order
optimizer-based unlearning by selectively updating only the critical neurons
responsible for encoding the forget-set. By constraining updates to these
targeted neurons, SIMU achieves comparable unlearning efficacy while
substantially outperforming current methods in retaining the model's original
knowledge.

TL;DR: MetaDefense is a novel framework that defends against finetuning-based jailbreak attacks in LLMs through a two-stage approach: pre-generation detection of harmful queries and mid-generation monitoring of partial responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defense mechanisms fail to generalize to harmful queries disguised by unseen attack templates, despite LLMs being capable of distinguishing disguised harmful queries in the embedding space.

Method: Two-stage defense approach: (i) pre-generation defense detects harmful queries before response generation, (ii) mid-generation defense monitors partial responses during generation. Trains LLM to predict harmfulness of queries and partial responses using specialized prompts.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures (LLaMA-2-7B, Qwen-2.5-3B-Instruct, LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct) show MetaDefense significantly outperforms existing defense mechanisms, achieving robust defense against harmful queries with seen and unseen attack templates while maintaining competitive performance on benign tasks.

Conclusion: MetaDefense provides an effective framework for defending against jailbreak attacks in LLMs through early detection and termination of potentially harmful interactions, demonstrating strong generalization to unseen attack templates.

Abstract: This paper introduces MetaDefense, a novel framework for defending against
finetuning-based jailbreak attacks in large language models (LLMs). We observe
that existing defense mechanisms fail to generalize to harmful queries
disguised by unseen attack templates, despite LLMs being capable of
distinguishing disguised harmful queries in the embedding space. Based on these
insights, we propose a two-stage defense approach: (i) pre-generation defense
that detects harmful queries before response generation begins, and (ii)
mid-generation defense that monitors partial responses during generation to
prevent outputting more harmful content. Our MetaDefense trains the LLM to
predict the harmfulness of both queries and partial responses using specialized
prompts, enabling early termination of potentially harmful interactions.
Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures (LLaMA-2-7B,
Qwen-2.5-3B-Instruct, and LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct) demonstrate that MetaDefense
significantly outperforms existing defense mechanisms, achieving robust defense
against harmful queries with seen and unseen attack templates while maintaining

*Emre Can Acikgoz,Cheng Qian,Heng Ji,Dilek Hakkani-Tür,Gokhan Tur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Test-Time Self-Improvement (TT-SI) enables language models to identify their own uncertain cases, generate similar examples from them, and fine-tune on these self-generated samples at test time, achieving significant performance gains with dramatically reduced training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fine-tuning requires large datasets which are inefficient to gather and expensive to train on, with no guarantee of better generalization. Existing methods don't assess whether training samples provide novel information or are redundant.

Method: Three-step algorithm: (1) identify samples the model struggles with (self-awareness), (2) generate similar examples from uncertain samples (self-data augmentation), (3) use these generated samples for test-time fine-tuning (self-improvement). Two variants: TT-SI (self-generated examples) and TT-D (distilled examples from stronger model).

Result: TT-SI achieves +5.48% absolute accuracy gain on average across benchmarks, surpassing standard learning methods while using 68x less training samples.

Conclusion: Test-time self-improvement algorithms show promise as a new paradigm for building more capable agents toward self-evolution, demonstrating the potential of on-the-fly model improvement.

Abstract: One paradigm of language model (LM) fine-tuning relies on creating large
training datasets, under the assumption that high quantity and diversity will
enable models to generalize to novel tasks after post-training. In practice,
gathering large sets of data is inefficient, and training on them is
prohibitively expensive; worse, there is no guarantee that the resulting model
will handle complex scenarios or generalize better. Moreover, existing
techniques rarely assess whether a training sample provides novel information
or is redundant with the knowledge already acquired by the model, resulting in
unnecessary costs. In this work, we explore a new test-time self-improvement
method to create more effective and generalizable agentic LMs on-the-fly. The
proposed algorithm can be summarized in three steps: (i) first it identifies
the samples that model struggles with (self-awareness), (ii) then generates
similar examples from detected uncertain samples (self-data augmentation), and
(iii) uses these newly generated samples at test-time fine-tuning
(self-improvement). We study two variants of this approach: Test-Time
Self-Improvement (TT-SI), where the same model generates additional training
examples from its own uncertain cases and then learns from them, and contrast
this approach with Test-Time Distillation (TT-D), where a stronger model
generates similar examples for uncertain cases, enabling student to adapt using
distilled supervision. Empirical evaluations across different agent benchmarks
demonstrate that TT-SI improves the performance with +5.48% absolute accuracy
gain on average across all benchmarks and surpasses other standard learning
methods, yet using 68x less training samples. Our findings highlight the
promise of TT-SI, demonstrating the potential of self-improvement algorithms at
test-time as a new paradigm for building more capable agents toward
self-evolution.

TL;DR: MA-GAD is a meta-learning framework for graph-level anomaly detection that addresses few-shot learning challenges by incorporating graph compression and meta-anomaly information extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN-based methods require large labeled datasets which are often unavailable in real-world scenarios, and few-shot approaches are vulnerable to noise interference leading to poor embedding quality and reduced robustness.

Method: Proposes MA-GAD framework with graph compression module to reduce graph size and mitigate noise, meta-learning to extract meta-anomaly information from similar networks for rapid adaptation to new tasks, and bias network to enhance distinction between anomalous and normal nodes.

Result: Experimental results on four real-world biochemical datasets show MA-GAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in graph-level anomaly detection under few-shot conditions, validated on both graph anomaly and subgraph anomaly detection tasks.

Conclusion: MA-GAD effectively addresses few-shot graph anomaly detection challenges through meta-learning and graph compression, demonstrating superior performance on real-world datasets compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Graph-level anomaly detection aims to identify anomalous graphs or subgraphs
within graph datasets, playing a vital role in various fields such as fraud
detection, review classification, and biochemistry. While Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) have made significant progress in this domain, existing methods rely
heavily on large amounts of labeled data, which is often unavailable in
real-world scenarios. Additionally, few-shot anomaly detection methods based on
GNNs are prone to noise interference, resulting in poor embedding quality and
reduced model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
meta-learning-based graph-level anomaly detection framework (MA-GAD),
incorporating a graph compression module that reduces the graph size,
mitigating noise interference while retaining essential node information. We
also leverage meta-learning to extract meta-anomaly information from similar
networks, enabling the learning of an initialization model that can rapidly
adapt to new tasks with limited samples. This improves the anomaly detection
performance on target graphs, and a bias network is used to enhance the
distinction between anomalous and normal nodes. Our experimental results, based
on four real-world biochemical datasets, demonstrate that MA-GAD outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods in graph-level anomaly detection under
few-shot conditions. Experiments on both graph anomaly and subgraph anomaly
detection tasks validate the framework's effectiveness on real-world datasets.

Method: Proposed AO-GPRLLSR pipeline: compared 5 SNR estimation methods (found LSR best), tested SVM and GPR for noise variance estimation (found Optimizable GPR best), combined into adaptive pipeline using NV-guided Wiener filter.

Result: The method achieved notable success in estimating SNR and noise variance of SEM images, leading to lower Mean Squared Error after filtering compared to other approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed AO-GPRLLSR filtering pipeline provides a robust and accurate solution for SEM image enhancement by effectively estimating noise parameters and guiding Wiener filtering.

Abstract: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images often suffer from noise
contamination, which degrades image quality and affects further analysis. This
research presents a complete approach to estimate their Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(SNR) and noise variance (NV), and enhance image quality using NV-guided Wiener
filter. The main idea of this study is to use a good SNR estimation technique
and infuse a machine learning model to estimate NV of the SEM image, which then
guides the wiener filter to remove the noise, providing a more robust and
accurate SEM image filtering pipeline. First, we investigate five different SNR
estimation techniques, namely Nearest Neighbourhood (NN) method, First-Order
Linear Interpolation (FOL) method, Nearest Neighbourhood with First-Order
Linear Interpolation (NN+FOL) method, Non-Linear Least Squares Regression
(NLLSR) method, and Linear Least Squares Regression (LSR) method. It is shown
that LSR method to perform better than the rest. Then, Support Vector Machines
(SVM) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) are tested by pairing it with LSR.
In this test, the Optimizable GPR model shows the highest accuracy and it
stands as the most effective solution for NV estimation. Combining these
results lead to the proposed Adaptive Optimizable Gaussian Process Regression
Linear Least Squares Regression (AO-GPRLLSR) Filtering pipeline. The AO-GPRLLSR
method generated an estimated noise variance which served as input to NV-guided
Wiener filter for improving the quality of SEM images. The proposed method is
shown to achieve notable success in estimating SNR and NV of SEM images and
leads to lower Mean Squared Error (MSE) after the filtering process.

*Chongmyung Kwon,Yujin Kim,Seoeun Park,Yunji Lee,Charmgil Hong*

TL;DR: Proposes MMM framework that integrates 3D quantum-chemical electron localization function (ELF) maps with graph neural networks for improved drug-drug interaction prediction, showing significant performance gains over baseline models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN-based drug recommendation systems use simplified discrete molecular representations that cannot fully capture molecular binding affinity and reactivity, leading to limitations in predicting drug-drug interactions.

Method: MMM framework combines 3D ELF electron density maps (capturing global electronic properties) with bipartite graph encoder (modeling local substructure interactions) to learn complementary drug characteristics.

Result: Evaluation on MIMIC-III dataset (250 drugs, 442 substructures) shows statistically significant improvements over GNN-based SafeDrug model in F1-score (p=0.0387), Jaccard (p=0.0112), and DDI rate (p=0.0386).

Conclusion: ELF-based 3D representations enhance prediction accuracy and support safer combinatorial drug prescribing in clinical practice, demonstrating the value of quantum-chemical information in drug representation learning.

Abstract: Drug recommendation is an essential task in machine learning-based clinical
decision support systems. However, the risk of drug-drug interactions (DDI)
between co-prescribed medications remains a significant challenge. Previous
studies have used graph neural networks (GNNs) to represent drug structures.
Regardless, their simplified discrete forms cannot fully capture the molecular
binding affinity and reactivity. Therefore, we propose Multimodal DDI
Prediction with Molecular Electron Localization Function (ELF) Maps (MMM), a
novel framework that integrates three-dimensional (3D) quantum-chemical
information into drug representation learning. It generates 3D electron density
maps using the ELF. To capture both therapeutic relevance and interaction
risks, MMM combines ELF-derived features that encode global electronic
properties with a bipartite graph encoder that models local substructure
interactions. This design enables learning complementary characteristics of
drug molecules. We evaluate MMM in the MIMIC-III dataset (250 drugs, 442
substructures), comparing it with several baseline models. In particular, a
comparison with the GNN-based SafeDrug model demonstrates statistically
significant improvements in the F1-score (p = 0.0387), Jaccard (p = 0.0112),
and the DDI rate (p = 0.0386). These results demonstrate the potential of
ELF-based 3D representations to enhance prediction accuracy and support safer
combinatorial drug prescribing in clinical practice.

*Murtaza Rangwala,Farag Azzedin,Richard O. Sinnott,Rajkumar Buyya*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SketchGuard is a Byzantine-robust decentralized federated learning framework that uses sketch-based neighbor screening to reduce communication and computation costs while maintaining security against malicious clients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Byzantine-robust DFL methods require exchanging and comparing complete high-dimensional model vectors with all neighbors in each round, creating prohibitive communication and computational costs that prevent web-scale deployment.

Method: SketchGuard compresses d-dimensional models to k-dimensional sketches (k << d) using Count Sketch for similarity comparisons, then selectively fetches full models only from accepted neighbors, decoupling Byzantine filtering from model aggregation.

Result: SketchGuard reduces computation time by up to 82% and communication overhead by 50-70% while maintaining identical robustness to state-of-the-art methods, with benefits scaling multiplicatively with model dimensionality and network connectivity.

Conclusion: SketchGuard establishes sketch-based compression as a fundamental enabler of robust decentralized federated learning at web scale by providing rigorous convergence guarantees and significant efficiency improvements.

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) enables privacy-preserving
collaborative training without centralized servers, but remains vulnerable to
Byzantine attacks where malicious clients submit corrupted model updates.
Existing Byzantine-robust DFL defenses rely on similarity-based neighbor
screening that requires every client to exchange and compare complete
high-dimensional model vectors with all neighbors in each training round,
creating prohibitive communication and computational costs that prevent
deployment at web scale. We propose SketchGuard, a general framework that
decouples Byzantine filtering from model aggregation through sketch-based
neighbor screening. SketchGuard compresses $d$-dimensional models to
$k$-dimensional sketches ($k \ll d$) using Count Sketch for similarity
comparisons, then selectively fetches full models only from accepted neighbors,
reducing per-round communication complexity from $O(d|N_i|)$ to $O(k|N_i| +
d|S_i|)$, where $|N_i|$ is the neighbor count and $|S_i| \le |N_i|$ is the
accepted neighbor count. We establish rigorous convergence guarantees in both
strongly convex and non-convex settings, proving that Count Sketch compression
preserves Byzantine resilience with controlled degradation bounds where
approximation errors introduce only a $(1+O(\epsilon))$ factor in the effective
threshold parameter. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets,
network topologies, and attack scenarios demonstrate that SketchGuard maintains
identical robustness to state-of-the-art methods while reducing computation
time by up to 82% and communication overhead by 50-70% depending on filtering
effectiveness, with benefits scaling multiplicatively with model dimensionality
and network connectivity. These results establish the viability of sketch-based
compression as a fundamental enabler of robust DFL at web scale.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SNNs can be deconstructed into timestep submodels for efficient self-distillation using Strong2Weak and Weak2Strong schemes, improving performance and adversarial robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To close the performance gap between SNNs and ANNs without relying on large teacher models or introducing significant training overhead.

Method: Treat each timestep instance as a submodel, identify strong/weak relationships, and implement two self-distillation schemes (Strong2Weak and Weak2Strong) with flexible implementations like ensemble, simultaneous, and cascade distillation.

Result: Effectively improves SNN discriminability and overall performance while enhancing adversarial robustness through self-distillation stability.

Conclusion: The method ingeniously exploits SNN temporal properties and provides insights for efficiently training high-performance SNNs.

Abstract: Brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise to be a low-power
alternative to computationally intensive artificial neural networks (ANNs),
although performance gaps persist. Recent studies have improved the performance
of SNNs through knowledge distillation, but rely on large teacher models or
introduce additional training overhead. In this paper, we show that SNNs can be
naturally deconstructed into multiple submodels for efficient
self-distillation. We treat each timestep instance of the SNN as a submodel and
evaluate its output confidence, thus efficiently identifying the strong and the
weak. Based on this strong and weak relationship, we propose two efficient
self-distillation schemes: (1) \textbf{Strong2Weak}: During training, the
stronger "teacher" guides the weaker "student", effectively improving overall
performance. (2) \textbf{Weak2Strong}: The weak serve as the "teacher",
distilling the strong in reverse with underlying dark knowledge, again yielding
significant performance gains. For both distillation schemes, we offer flexible
implementations such as ensemble, simultaneous, and cascade distillation.
Experiments show that our method effectively improves the discriminability and
overall performance of the SNN, while its adversarial robustness is also
enhanced, benefiting from the stability brought by self-distillation. This
ingeniously exploits the temporal properties of SNNs and provides insight into
how to efficiently train high-performance SNNs.

*Alexander Rubinstein,Benjamin Raible,Martin Gubri,Seong Joon Oh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DISCO is a method for efficient ML model evaluation that selects samples based on model disagreement rather than clustering, achieving state-of-the-art performance prediction with lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern ML model evaluation is prohibitively expensive (thousands of GPU hours), reducing inclusivity, slowing innovation, and worsening environmental impact.

Method: DISCO selects top-k samples with greatest model disagreements using greedy, sample-wise statistics instead of global clustering, focusing on maximizing diversity in model responses.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in performance prediction across MMLU, Hellaswag, Winogrande, and ARC benchmarks.

Conclusion: Model disagreement provides an information-theoretically optimal rule for sample selection, offering a conceptually simpler and more effective approach than traditional clustering-based methods.

Abstract: Evaluating modern machine learning models has become prohibitively expensive.
Benchmarks such as LMMs-Eval and HELM demand thousands of GPU hours per model.
Costly evaluation reduces inclusivity, slows the cycle of innovation, and
worsens environmental impact. The typical approach follows two steps. First,
select an anchor subset of data. Second, train a mapping from the accuracy on
this subset to the final test result. The drawback is that anchor selection
depends on clustering, which can be complex and sensitive to design choices. We
argue that promoting diversity among samples is not essential; what matters is
to select samples that $\textit{maximise diversity in model responses}$. Our
method, $\textbf{Diversifying Sample Condensation (DISCO)}$, selects the top-k
samples with the greatest model disagreements. This uses greedy, sample-wise
statistics rather than global clustering. The approach is conceptually simpler.
From a theoretical view, inter-model disagreement provides an
information-theoretically optimal rule for such greedy selection.
$\textbf{DISCO}$ shows empirical gains over prior methods, achieving
state-of-the-art results in performance prediction across MMLU, Hellaswag,
Winogrande, and ARC. Code is available here:

### [257] [PRESCRIBE: Predicting Single-Cell Responses with Bayesian Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07964)
*Jiabei Cheng,Changxi Chi,Jingbo Zhou,Hongyi Xin,Jun Xia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRESCRIBE is a Bayesian deep learning framework that jointly estimates epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in single-cell perturbation predictions, enabling reliable confidence scoring and filtering of untrustworthy results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-cell perturbation prediction requires assessing prediction reliability due to the stochastic nature of gene perturbation processes. Current methods don't adequately capture both epistemic uncertainty (from gene similarity to training data) and aleatoric uncertainty (from data quality).

Method: PRESCRIBE uses multivariate deep evidential regression to jointly model both sources of uncertainty - epistemic uncertainty from target gene similarity to training genes, and aleatoric uncertainty from training data quality.

Result: PRESCRIBE effectively estimates confidence scores that strongly correlate with empirical accuracy, enabling filtering of untrustworthy predictions and achieving over 3% accuracy improvement compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The framework provides reliable uncertainty quantification for single-cell perturbation predictions, making it possible to identify and filter unreliable results while maintaining improved overall accuracy.

Abstract: In single-cell perturbation prediction, a central task is to forecast the
effects of perturbing a gene unseen in the training data. The efficacy of such
predictions depends on two factors: (1) the similarity of the target gene to
those covered in the training data, which informs model (epistemic)
uncertainty, and (2) the quality of the corresponding training data, which
reflects data (aleatoric) uncertainty. Both factors are critical for
determining the reliability of a prediction, particularly as gene perturbation
is an inherently stochastic biochemical process. In this paper, we propose
PRESCRIBE (PREdicting Single-Cell Response wIth Bayesian Estimation), a
multivariate deep evidential regression framework designed to measure both
sources of uncertainty jointly. Our analysis demonstrates that PRESCRIBE
effectively estimates a confidence score for each prediction, which strongly
correlates with its empirical accuracy. This capability enables the filtering
of untrustworthy results, and in our experiments, it achieves steady accuracy
improvements of over 3% compared to comparable baselines.

TL;DR: A multi-agent reinforcement learning framework with a high-fidelity climate surrogate model that accelerates climate policy training by 100x while maintaining policy fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate policy studies need models that capture multiple greenhouse gas effects on global temperature, but existing models are computationally expensive and difficult to embed in reinforcement learning.

Method: Developed a recurrent neural network architecture pretrained on 20,000 multi-gas emission pathways to surrogate the CICERO-SCM climate model, achieving 1000x faster inference.

Result: The surrogate model attained near-simulator accuracy with global-mean temperature RMSE ≈ 0.0004K and accelerated end-to-end training by >100x in climate-policy MARL settings.

Conclusion: The framework bypasses computational bottlenecks without sacrificing policy fidelity, enabling large-scale multi-agent experiments across alternative climate-policy regimes with multi-gas dynamics.

Abstract: Climate policy studies require models that capture the combined effects of
multiple greenhouse gases on global temperature, but these models are
computationally expensive and difficult to embed in reinforcement learning. We
present a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that integrates a
high-fidelity, highly efficient climate surrogate directly in the environment
loop, enabling regional agents to learn climate policies under multi-gas
dynamics. As a proof of concept, we introduce a recurrent neural network
architecture pretrained on ($20{,}000$) multi-gas emission pathways to
surrogate the climate model CICERO-SCM. The surrogate model attains
near-simulator accuracy with global-mean temperature RMSE $\approx 0.0004
\mathrm{K}$ and approximately $1000\times$ faster one-step inference. When
substituted for the original simulator in a climate-policy MARL setting, it
accelerates end-to-end training by $>\!100\times$. We show that the surrogate
and simulator converge to the same optimal policies and propose a methodology
to assess this property in cases where using the simulator is intractable. Our
work allows to bypass the core computational bottleneck without sacrificing
policy fidelity, enabling large-scale multi-agent experiments across
alternative climate-policy regimes with multi-gas dynamics and high-fidelity
climate response.

*Qinglun Li,Yingqi Liu,Miao Zhang,Xiaochun Cao,Quanjun Yin,Li Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multi-Gossip Steps (MGS) bridges decentralized and centralized training, reducing performance gaps but cannot fully eliminate them. Theoretical analysis shows MGS reduces optimization error exponentially but leaves a non-negligible generalization gap compared to centralized training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decentralized training is communication-efficient but suffers from degraded performance compared to centralized training. The effectiveness of MGS and whether it can fully eliminate this gap remain open theoretical questions.

Method: The authors use stability analysis to derive upper bounds on generalization error and excess error of MGS. They provide unified analysis of factors like learning rate, data heterogeneity, node count, per-node sample size, and communication topology under non-convex settings without bounded gradients assumption.

Result: 1) MGS reduces optimization error bound at exponential rate, tightening generalization error bound. 2) Even with infinite MGS, a non-negligible generalization gap remains compared to centralized mini-batch SGD. Experiments on CIFAR datasets support these theoretical findings.

Conclusion: MGS significantly improves decentralized training performance but cannot fully close the gap to centralized training. The theoretical analysis provides comprehensive understanding of how various factors impact MGS generalization in decentralized settings.

Abstract: Decentralized training removes the centralized server, making it a
communication-efficient approach that can significantly improve training
efficiency, but it often suffers from degraded performance compared to
centralized training. Multi-Gossip Steps (MGS) serve as a simple yet effective
bridge between decentralized and centralized training, significantly reducing
experiment performance gaps. However, the theoretical reasons for its
effectiveness and whether this gap can be fully eliminated by MGS remain open
questions. In this paper, we derive upper bounds on the generalization error
and excess error of MGS using stability analysis, systematically answering
these two key questions. 1). Optimization Error Reduction: MGS reduces the
optimization error bound at an exponential rate, thereby exponentially
tightening the generalization error bound and enabling convergence to better
solutions. 2). Gap to Centralization: Even as MGS approaches infinity, a
non-negligible gap in generalization error remains compared to centralized
mini-batch SGD ($\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{c\beta}{c\beta +1}}/{n m})$ in
centralized and $\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{2c\beta}{2c\beta +2}}/{n
m^{\frac{1}{2c\beta +2}}})$ in decentralized). Furthermore, we provide the
first unified analysis of how factors like learning rate, data heterogeneity,
node count, per-node sample size, and communication topology impact the
generalization of MGS under non-convex settings without the bounded gradients
assumption, filling a critical theoretical gap in decentralized training.
Finally, promising experiments on CIFAR datasets support our theoretical
findings.

*Kazuki Egashira,Robin Staab,Thibaud Gloaguen,Mark Vero,Martin Vechev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Model pruning methods can be maliciously exploited to create LLMs that appear benign but exhibit malicious behaviors after pruning, revealing a critical security vulnerability in deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the security implications of LLM pruning methods, which have been underexplored despite their widespread use in reducing model size for inference.

Method: Adversaries compute proxy metrics to identify parameters likely/unlikely to be pruned, inject malicious behaviors into unlikely-to-be-pruned parameters, and repair the model using likely-to-be-pruned parameters to hide the behavior in unpruned models.

Result: After applying pruning methods (Magnitude, Wanda, SparseGPT) in vLLM, models consistently exhibit strong malicious behaviors with success rates up to 95.7% for jailbreak, 98.7% for benign instruction refusal, and 99.5% for targeted content injection.

Conclusion: This work reveals a critical deployment-time security gap in model compression and underscores the urgent need for stronger security awareness in pruning methods.

Abstract: Model pruning, i.e., removing a subset of model weights, has become a
prominent approach to reducing the memory footprint of large language models
(LLMs) during inference. Notably, popular inference engines, such as vLLM,
enable users to conveniently prune downloaded models before they are deployed.
While the utility and efficiency of pruning methods have improved
significantly, the security implications of pruning remain underexplored. In
this work, for the first time, we show that modern LLM pruning methods can be
maliciously exploited. In particular, an adversary can construct a model that
appears benign yet, once pruned, exhibits malicious behaviors. Our method is
based on the idea that the adversary can compute a proxy metric that estimates
how likely each parameter is to be pruned. With this information, the adversary
can first inject a malicious behavior into those parameters that are unlikely
to be pruned. Then, they can repair the model by using parameters that are
likely to be pruned, effectively canceling out the injected behavior in the
unpruned model. We demonstrate the severity of our attack through extensive
evaluation on five models; after any of the pruning in vLLM are applied
(Magnitude, Wanda, and SparseGPT), it consistently exhibits strong malicious
behaviors in a diverse set of attack scenarios (success rates of up to $95.7\%$
for jailbreak, $98.7\%$ for benign instruction refusal, and $99.5\%$ for
targeted content injection). Our results reveal a critical deployment-time
security gap and underscore the urgent need for stronger security awareness in
model compression.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DUA-D2C improves upon Divide2Conquer by dynamically weighting subset models based on validation performance and uncertainty, enhancing generalization against overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard D2C treats all subset models equally, potentially underutilizing their varying generalization capabilities. DUA-D2C aims to intelligently aggregate models based on their performance and uncertainty.

Method: Extends D2C by dynamically weighting subset models using validation set performance and prediction uncertainty, allowing preferential learning from more generalizable models.

Result: Significantly improves generalization on benchmark datasets across multiple domains, even when applied on top of other regularization methods.

Conclusion: DUA-D2C is a theoretically grounded and effective approach to combat overfitting in deep learning through intelligent model aggregation.

Abstract: Overfitting remains a significant challenge in deep learning, often arising
from data outliers, noise, and limited training data. To address this, the
Divide2Conquer (D2C) method was previously proposed, which partitions training
data into multiple subsets and trains identical models independently on each.
This strategy enables learning more consistent patterns while minimizing the
influence of individual outliers and noise. However, D2C's standard aggregation
typically treats all subset models equally or based on fixed heuristics (like
data size), potentially underutilizing information about their varying
generalization capabilities. Building upon this foundation, we introduce
Dynamic Uncertainty-Aware Divide2Conquer (DUA-D2C), an advanced technique that
refines the aggregation process. DUA-D2C dynamically weights the contributions
of subset models based on their performance on a shared validation set,
considering both accuracy and prediction uncertainty. This intelligent
aggregation allows the central model to preferentially learn from subsets
yielding more generalizable and confident edge models, thereby more effectively
combating overfitting. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets spanning
multiple domains demonstrate that DUA-D2C significantly improves
generalization. Our analysis includes evaluations of decision boundaries, loss
curves, and other performance metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of
DUA-D2C. This study demonstrates that DUA-D2C improves generalization
performance even when applied on top of other regularization methods,
establishing it as a theoretically grounded and effective approach to combating
overfitting in modern deep learning. Our codes are publicly available at:

Result: Scaled to 70B parameter models with over 1T training tokens, achieving 10.66% accuracy gain over training from scratch under same additional compute budget.

Conclusion: Checkpoint recycling establishes a foundation for economically efficient large language model pretraining by leveraging prior computational investments.

Abstract: The rapidly increasing computational cost of pretraining Large Language
Models necessitates more efficient approaches. Numerous computational costs
have been invested in existing well-trained checkpoints, but many of them
remain underutilized due to engineering constraints or limited model capacity.
To efficiently reuse this "sunk" cost, we propose to recycle pretrained
checkpoints by expanding their parameter counts and continuing training. We
propose orthogonal growth method well-suited for converged Mixture-of-Experts
model: interpositional layer copying for depth growth and expert duplication
with injected noise for width growth. To determine the optimal timing for such
growth across checkpoints sequences, we perform comprehensive scaling
experiments revealing that the final accuracy has a strong positive correlation
with the amount of sunk cost, indicating that greater prior investment leads to
better performance. We scale our approach to models with 70B parameters and
over 1T training tokens, achieving 10.66% accuracy gain over training from
scratch under the same additional compute budget. Our checkpoint recycling
approach establishes a foundation for economically efficient large language

TL;DR: Novel framework using nested evolving set processes to accelerate Personalized PageRank computation with improved time complexity independent of graph size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational challenges of Personalized PageRank on large graphs and provide more efficient algorithms with better theoretical guarantees.

Method: Uses nested evolving set processes with localized inexact proximal point iterations to solve simplified linear systems, requiring only O~(1/√α) such systems to be solved.

Result: Achieves time complexity of min{O~(R²/ε²), O~(m)} for ε-approximation, and O~(R²/(√αε²)) when 1/ε² ≪ m, independent of graph size. Resolves an open conjecture.

Conclusion: The framework provides efficient PPR computation with theoretical guarantees and practical performance, validated by experiments on real-world graphs showing early convergence.

Abstract: This work proposes a novel framework based on nested evolving set processes
to accelerate Personalized PageRank (PPR) computation. At each stage of the
process, we employ a localized inexact proximal point iteration to solve a
simplified linear system. We show that the time complexity of such localized
methods is upper bounded by $\min\{\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(R^2/\epsilon^2),
\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(m)\}$ to obtain an $\epsilon$-approximation of the PPR
vector, where $m$ denotes the number of edges in the graph and $R$ is a
constant defined via nested evolving set processes. Furthermore, the algorithms
induced by our framework require solving only
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{\alpha})$ such linear systems, where $\alpha$ is
the damping factor. When $1/\epsilon^2\ll m$, this implies the existence of an
algorithm that computes an $\ epsilon $-approximation of the PPR vector with an
overall time complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(R^2 /
(\sqrt{\alpha}\epsilon^2)\right)$, independent of the underlying graph size.
Our result resolves an open conjecture from existing literature. Experimental
results on real-world graphs validate the efficiency of our methods,
demonstrating significant convergence in the early stages.

Method: Uses HMM framework to jointly model conditional channel propagation (power, delay, angle) and user trajectory evolution with Gaussian-Markov model, handling both LOS and NLOS conditions.

Result: Achieves 0.65m average localization accuracy in indoor environments with simulated MIMO-OFDM networks, outperforming supervised methods like KNN, SVM, and DNN.

Conclusion: The proposed unsupervised method successfully constructs radio maps without location calibration and enables accurate localization in both LOS and NLOS conditions.

Abstract: Radio maps are essential for enhancing wireless communications and
localization. However, existing methods for constructing radio maps typically
require costly calibration pro- cesses to collect location-labeled channel
state information (CSI) datasets. This paper aims to recover the data
collection trajectory directly from the channel propagation sequence,
eliminating the need for location calibration. The key idea is to employ a
hidden Markov model (HMM)-based framework to conditionally model the channel
propagation matrix, while simultaneously modeling the location correlation in
the trajectory. The primary challenges involve modeling the complex
relationship between channel propagation in multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) networks and geographical locations, and addressing both line-of-sight
(LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) indoor conditions. In this paper, we propose
an HMM-based framework that jointly characterizes the conditional propagation
model and the evolution of the user trajectory. Specifically, the channel
propagation in MIMO networks is modeled separately in terms of power, delay,
and angle, with distinct models for LOS and NLOS conditions. The user
trajectory is modeled using a Gaussian-Markov model. The parameters for channel
propagation, the mobility model, and LOS/NLOS classification are optimized
simultaneously. Experimental validation using simulated MIMO-Orthogonal
Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) networks with a multi-antenna uniform
linear arrays (ULA) configuration demonstrates that the proposed method
achieves an average localization accuracy of 0.65 meters in an indoor
environment, covering both LOS and NLOS regions. Moreover, the constructed
radio map enables localization with a reduced error compared to conventional
supervised methods, such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine
(SVM), and deep neural network (DNN).

### [266] [Backdoor Vectors: a Task Arithmetic View on Backdoor Attacks and Defenses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08016)
*Stanisław Pawlak,Jan Dubiński,Daniel Marczak,Bartłomiej Twardowski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes backdoor attacks in model merging and proposes both enhanced attacks (Sparse Backdoor Vectors) and defenses (Injection BV Subtraction) using the concept of Backdoor Vectors as task vectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model merging is vulnerable to backdoor attacks where adversaries can control merged model outputs. Understanding these attacks as task vectors can provide better insights and defenses.

Method: Proposes Backdoor Vectors (BVs) as weight differences between backdoored and clean models, Sparse Backdoor Vectors (SBVs) to combine multiple attacks, and Injection BV Subtraction (IBVS) as a defense that subtracts backdoor vectors.

Result: SBVs outperform previous backdoor attacks and are the first to leverage merging to improve attack effectiveness. IBVS provides effective defense even against unknown backdoor threats.

Conclusion: The Backdoor Vector framework enables better understanding of backdoor attacks in model merging, with SBVs enhancing attack capabilities and IBVS offering a lightweight, assumption-free defense against backdoor threats.

Abstract: Model merging (MM) recently emerged as an effective method for combining
large deep learning models. However, it poses significant security risks.
Recent research shows that it is highly susceptible to backdoor attacks, which
introduce a hidden trigger into a single fine-tuned model instance that allows
the adversary to control the output of the final merged model at inference
time. In this work, we propose a simple framework for understanding backdoor
attacks by treating the attack itself as a task vector. $Backdoor\ Vector\
(BV)$ is calculated as the difference between the weights of a fine-tuned
backdoored model and fine-tuned clean model. BVs reveal new insights into
attacks understanding and a more effective framework to measure their
similarity and transferability. Furthermore, we propose a novel method that
enhances backdoor resilience through merging dubbed $Sparse\ Backdoor\ Vector\
(SBV)$ that combines multiple attacks into a single one. We identify the core
vulnerability behind backdoor threats in MM: $inherent\ triggers$ that exploit
adversarial weaknesses in the base model. To counter this, we propose
$Injection\ BV\ Subtraction\ (IBVS)$ - an assumption-free defense against
backdoors in MM. Our results show that SBVs surpass prior attacks and is the
first method to leverage merging to improve backdoor effectiveness. At the same
time, IBVS provides a lightweight, general defense that remains effective even
when the backdoor threat is entirely unknown.

### [267] [Do We Really Need Permutations? Impact of Width Expansion on Linear Mode Connectivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08023)
*Akira Ito,Masanori Yamada,Daiki Chijiwa,Atsutoshi Kumagai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper shows that widening neural networks enables linear mode connectivity (LMC) without parameter permutations, using softmax temperature calibration and explaining the phenomenon through layerwise exponentially weighted connectivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work suggested that achieving LMC requires both permutation search and wide models, but this study aims to demonstrate that widening alone is sufficient when using proper calibration.

Method: The authors use softmax temperature calibration and analyze intermediate layer outputs through layerwise exponentially weighted connectivity (LEWC), which represents merged model outputs as exponentially weighted sums of original model outputs.

Result: Empirical results show that widening models enables LMC without permutations, and the LEWC analysis explains how merged models behave like ensembles of original models.

Conclusion: Model widening not only facilitates nonlinear mode connectivity as previously known, but also significantly increases the possibility of achieving linear mode connectivity without requiring parameter permutations.

Abstract: Recently, Ainsworth et al. empirically demonstrated that, given two
independently trained models, applying a parameter permutation that preserves
the input-output behavior allows the two models to be connected by a low-loss
linear path. When such a path exists, the models are said to achieve linear
mode connectivity (LMC). Prior studies, including Ainsworth et al., have
reported that achieving LMC requires not only an appropriate permutation search
but also sufficiently wide models (e.g., a 32 $\times$ width multiplier for
ResNet-20). This is broadly believed to be because increasing the model width
ensures a large enough space of candidate permutations, increasing the chance
of finding one that yields LMC. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that,
even without any permutations, simply widening the models is sufficient for
achieving LMC when using a suitable softmax temperature calibration. We further
explain why this phenomenon arises by analyzing intermediate layer outputs.
Specifically, we introduce layerwise exponentially weighted connectivity
(LEWC), which states that the output of each layer of the merged model can be
represented as an exponentially weighted sum of the outputs of the
corresponding layers of the original models. Consequently the merged model's
output matches that of an ensemble of the original models, which facilitates
LMC. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to show that widening
the model not only facilitates nonlinear mode connectivity, as suggested in
prior research, but also significantly increases the possibility of achieving
linear mode connectivity.

*Gunjun Lee,Jiwon Kim,Jaiyoung Park,Younjoo Lee,Jung Ho Ahn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Layered prefill is a new scheduling paradigm that treats transformer layer groups as the primary scheduling unit, reducing overhead in Mixture-of-Experts models by eliminating chunk-induced weight reloads and improving latency and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current stall-free scheduling techniques like chunked prefill incur substantial overhead in Mixture-of-Experts models, causing redundant expert weight loads that increase memory traffic by up to 39% and inflate energy consumption.

Method: Proposes layered prefill that vertically partitions the model into contiguous layer groups and interleaves prefill and decode across these groups, treating transformer layer groups as the primary scheduling unit instead of tokens.

Result: Reduces off-chip bandwidth demand, lowering TTFT by up to 70%, End-to-End latency by 41%, and per-token energy by up to 22%. Consistently improves the TTFT-TBT Pareto frontier over chunked prefill while maintaining stall-free decoding.

Conclusion: Shifting the scheduling axis from tokens to layers unlocks a new operating regime for high-efficiency, energy-aware LLM serving in co-located environments, eliminating expert-load traffic and energy costs while sustaining performance.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) inference in production must meet stringent
service-level objectives for both time-to-first-token (TTFT) and
time-between-token (TBT) while maximizing throughput under fixed compute,
memory, and interconnect budgets. Modern serving systems adopt stall-free
scheduling techniques such as chunked prefill, which splits long prompt
processing along the token dimension and interleaves prefill with ongoing
decode iterations. While effective at stabilizing TBT, chunked prefill incurs
substantial overhead in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models: redundant expert
weight loads increase memory traffic by up to 39% and inflate energy
consumption. We propose layered prefill, a new scheduling paradigm that treats
transformer layer groups as the primary scheduling unit. By vertically
partitioning the model into contiguous layer groups and interleaving prefill
and decode across the groups, layered prefill sustains stall-free decoding
while eliminating chunk-induced MoE weight reloads. It reduces off-chip
bandwidth demand, lowering TTFT by up to 70%, End-to-End latency by 41% and
per-token energy by up to 22%. Evaluations show that layered prefill
consistently improves the TTFT--TBT Pareto frontier over chunked prefill,
reducing expert-load traffic and energy cost while maintaining stall-free
decoding. Overall, shifting the scheduling axis from tokens to layers unlocks a
new operating regime for high-efficiency, energy-aware LLM serving in
co-located environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Subject-Conditioned Layer, an adaptive layer that decomposes weights into shared subject-invariant components and subject-specific low-rank corrections to address subject-specific distribution shifts in EEG decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subject-specific distribution shifts are a major obstacle for developing foundation models for EEG decoding, as EEG signals vary significantly between individuals.

Method: Designs Subject-Conditioned Layer as a drop-in replacement for standard layers, decomposing weights into shared subject-invariant components and lightweight low-rank subject-specific corrections.

Result: Models with Subject-Conditioned Layer outperform both subject-agnostic models and the average of individually trained subject-specific models.

Conclusion: The layer provides a practical and scalable approach for building effective cross-subject foundation models for EEG decoding.

Abstract: Subject-specific distribution shifts represent an important obstacle to the
development of foundation models for EEG decoding. To address this, we propose
Subject-Conditioned Layer,, an adaptive layer designed as a drop-in replacement
for standard linear or convolutional layers in any neural network architecture.
Our layer captures subject-specific variability by decomposing its weights into
a shared, subject-invariant component and a lightweight, low-rank correction
unique to each subject. This explicit separation of general knowledge from
personalized adaptation allows existing models to become robust to subject
shifts. Empirically, models equipped with our layer outperform both a
shared-weight-only model (subject-agnostic model) and the average of
individually trained subject-specific models. Consequently, the
Subject-Conditioned Layer, offers a practical and scalable path towards
building effective cross-subject foundation models for EEG.

*Daniel Jarne Ornia,Joel Dyer,Nicholas Bishop,Anisoara Calinescu,Michael Wooldridge*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies how learning agents can optimally incorporate expert data in Bayesian multi-armed bandits, proposing information-theoretic algorithms for deciding when to learn from experts versus own experience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complex learning agents are increasingly deployed alongside existing experts, but it remains unclear how learners should optimally incorporate expert data that may differ in structure from their own action-outcome experiences.

Method: The authors study Bayesian multi-armed bandits in two settings: (i) offline settings with expert dataset before interaction, and (ii) simultaneous settings where learners choose whether to update beliefs based on own experience or expert outcomes. They propose an information-directed rule that processes the data source maximizing one-step information gain about the optimal action.

Result: The authors prove that pretraining on expert outcomes tightens information-theoretic regret bounds by the mutual information between expert data and optimal action. They propose strategies for inferring when to trust the expert and when not to.

Conclusion: By quantifying the value of expert data, the framework provides practical, information-theoretic algorithms for agents to intelligently decide when to learn from others, safeguarding learners when experts are ineffective or compromised.

Abstract: Complex learning agents are increasingly deployed alongside existing experts,
such as human operators or previously trained agents. However, it remains
unclear how should learners optimally incorporate certain forms of expert data,
which may differ in structure from the learner's own action-outcome
experiences. We study this problem in the context of Bayesian multi-armed
bandits, considering: (i) offline settings, where the learner receives a
dataset of outcomes from the expert's optimal policy before interaction, and
(ii) simultaneous settings, where the learner must choose at each step whether
to update its beliefs based on its own experience, or based on the outcome
simultaneously achieved by an expert. We formalize how expert data influences
the learner's posterior, and prove that pretraining on expert outcomes tightens
information-theoretic regret bounds by the mutual information between the
expert data and the optimal action. For the simultaneous setting, we propose an
information-directed rule where the learner processes the data source that
maximizes their one-step information gain about the optimal action. Finally, we
propose strategies for how the learner can infer when to trust the expert and
when not to, safeguarding the learner for the cases where the expert is
ineffective or compromised. By quantifying the value of expert data, our
framework provides practical, information-theoretic algorithms for agents to
intelligently decide when to learn from others.

### [271] [Approximate Domain Unlearning for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08132)
*Kodai Kawamura,Yuta Goto,Rintaro Yanagi,Hirokatsu Kataoka,Go Irie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Approximate Domain Unlearning (ADU), a novel problem setting for Vision-Language Models that aims to selectively remove recognition capability for specific domains (e.g., illustrations) while preserving performance on other domains (e.g., real images), addressing limitations of existing class unlearning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained VLMs retain irrelevant information beyond downstream task requirements, raising efficiency and information leakage concerns. Existing class unlearning approaches are insufficient for practical scenarios like autonomous driving where domain-level unlearning (e.g., distinguishing real cars from illustrated ones) is crucial for safety.

Method: Proposes a novel approach that explicitly disentangles domain distributions and adaptively captures instance-specific domain information to address the challenge of highly entangled domain distributions in VLM feature spaces.

Result: Extensive experiments show the proposed approach outperforms baselines built upon VLM tuning techniques, demonstrating effective domain unlearning while preserving overall model performance.

Conclusion: The work paves the way for practical and fine-grained unlearning in VLMs by introducing and solving the ADU problem, enabling more targeted knowledge removal at the domain level rather than just class level.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong generalization
capabilities, enabling them to recognize a wide range of objects across diverse
domains without additional training. However, they often retain irrelevant
information beyond the requirements of specific downstream tasks, raising
concerns about computational efficiency and potential information leakage. This
has motivated growing interest in approximate unlearning, which aims to
selectively remove unnecessary knowledge while preserving overall model
performance. Existing approaches to approximate unlearning have primarily
focused on class unlearning, where a VLM is retrained to fail to recognize
specified object classes while maintaining accuracy for others. However, merely
forgetting object classes is often insufficient in practical applications. For
instance, an autonomous driving system should accurately recognize real cars
while avoiding misrecognition of illustrated cars depicted in roadside
advertisements as real cars, which could be hazardous. In this paper, we
introduce Approximate Domain Unlearning (ADU), a novel problem setting that
requires reducing recognition accuracy for images from specified domains (e.g.,
illustration) while preserving accuracy for other domains (e.g., real). ADU
presents new technical challenges: due to the strong domain generalization
capability of pre-trained VLMs, domain distributions are highly entangled in
the feature space, making naive approaches based on penalizing target domains
ineffective. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel approach that
explicitly disentangles domain distributions and adaptively captures
instance-specific domain information. Extensive experiments show that our
approach outperforms baselines built upon VLM tuning techniques, paving the way
for practical and fine-grained unlearning in VLMs. Code:

*Chen Wang,Zhaochun Li,Jionghao Bai,Yuzhi Zhang,Shisheng Cui,Zhou Zhao,Yue Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AEPO solves entropy collapse in RL fine-tuning by replacing entropy bonuses with temperature-adjusted policy gradients, enabling precise entropy control and revealing a non-monotonic relationship between entropy and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like GRPO suffer from entropy collapse where entropy monotonically decreases, leading to premature convergence and vanishing exploration. Current entropy-regularized approaches only partially address this while introducing bias and instability.

Method: AEPO uses three key designs: policy gradient as regularization, distribution as regularization, and REINFORCE as regularization. It replaces entropy bonuses with REINFORCE policy gradient on temperature-adjusted distributions and stabilizes entropy through temperature regulation.

Result: AEPO stabilizes entropy at arbitrary target levels, eliminates collapse in GRPO, reveals a non-monotonic relationship between entropy and performance, and generalizes beyond entropy to enable superior target distributions as REINFORCE regularizers.

Conclusion: AEPO provides a comprehensive solution to entropy collapse in RL fine-tuning, enabling precise entropy control and establishing a broader paradigm where target distributions can serve as effective regularizers.

Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) is essential for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLM), yet the widely adopted Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffers from entropy collapse, where
entropy monotonically decreases, exploration vanishes, and policies converge
prematurely. Existing entropy-regularized methods only partially alleviate this
issue while introducing bias and instability, leaving entropy control
unresolved and the connection between entropy, exploration, and performance
unclear. We propose Arbitrary Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO), which
eliminates entropy collapse by replacing entropy bonuses with REINFORCE policy
gradient on temperature-adjusted distributions and stabilizing entropy through
temperature regulation. AEPO integrates three key designs: policy gradient as
regularization, distribution as regularization, and REINFORCE as
regularization, enabling precise entropy control without distorting
optimization. Experiments demonstrate three major contributions: AEPO (1)
stabilizes entropy at arbitrary target levels, effectively removing collapse in
GRPO; (2) reveals a non-monotonic relation where performance first improves
then declines with increasing entropy, clarifying the link between entropy,
exploration, and reasoning; and (3) generalizes beyond entropy, providing a
broader RFT paradigm where superior target distributions can serve as REINFORCE
regularizers.

TL;DR: Entropy-based framework uses token-level confidence to enable early stopping in reasoning tasks, achieving 25-50% computational savings while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve token efficiency and reduce computational costs in large language models during reasoning tasks by leveraging emergent confidence properties.

Method: Uses Shannon entropy from token-level logprobs as a confidence signal for early stopping, with entropy thresholds calculated using few examples from reasoning datasets.

Result: Achieves 25-50% computational savings while preserving task accuracy, demonstrating that advanced reasoning models exhibit emergent confidence awareness.

Conclusion: Entropy-based confidence calibration represents an emergent property of advanced post-training optimization and can be exploited to significantly reduce computational costs in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: We introduce a simple, yet novel entropy-based framework to drive token
efficiency in large language models during reasoning tasks. Our approach uses
Shannon entropy from token-level logprobs as a confidence signal to enable
early stopping, achieving 25-50% computational savings while maintaining task
accuracy. Crucially, we demonstrate that entropy-based confidence calibration
represents an emergent property of advanced post-training optimization present
in modern reasoning models but notably absent in standard instruction-tuned and
pre-trained models (Llama 3.3 70B). We show that the entropy threshold to stop
reasoning varies from model to model but can be calculated easily in one shot
using only a few examples from existing reasoning datasets. Our results
indicate that advanced reasoning models often know that they've gotten a
correct answer early on, and that this emergent confidence awareness can be
exploited to save tokens and reduce latency. The framework demonstrates
consistent performance across reasoning-optimized model families with 25-50%
computational cost reduction while preserving accuracy, revealing that
confidence mechanisms represent a distinguishing characteristic of modern
post-trained reasoning systems versus their predecessors.

TL;DR: GALA is a scalable federated unsupervised multi-source domain adaptation framework that uses inter-group discrepancy minimization and centroid-based weighting to handle many heterogeneous source domains efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing distributed UMDA methods don't scale well with many source domains, leading to high computational costs and unstable performance.

Method: Proposes GALA with two key components: (1) inter-group discrepancy minimization for efficient domain alignment without quadratic computation, and (2) temperature-controlled centroid-based weighting to prioritize source domains dynamically.

Result: GALA achieves competitive or state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks and significantly outperforms prior methods in diverse multi-source settings where others fail to converge.

Conclusion: GALA provides a scalable and robust solution for federated UMDA that effectively handles large numbers of heterogeneous source domains.

Abstract: Unsupervised multi-source domain adaptation (UMDA) aims to learn models that
generalize to an unlabeled target domain by leveraging labeled data from
multiple, diverse source domains. While distributed UMDA methods address
privacy constraints by avoiding raw data sharing, existing approaches typically
assume a small number of sources and fail to scale effectively. Increasing the
number of heterogeneous domains often makes existing methods impractical,
leading to high computational overhead or unstable performance. We propose
GALA, a scalable and robust federated UMDA framework that introduces two key
components: (1) a novel inter-group discrepancy minimization objective that
efficiently approximates full pairwise domain alignment without quadratic
computation; and (2) a temperature-controlled, centroid-based weighting
strategy that dynamically prioritizes source domains based on alignment with
the target. Together, these components enable stable and parallelizable
training across large numbers of heterogeneous sources. To evaluate performance
in high-diversity scenarios, we introduce Digit-18, a new benchmark comprising
18 digit datasets with varied synthetic and real-world domain shifts. Extensive
experiments show that GALA consistently achieves competitive or
state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks and significantly outperforms
prior methods in diverse multi-source settings where others fail to converge.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Person identification is crucial for intelligent human-computer interaction. While existing work focuses on sub-6 GHz Wi-Fi, mmWave offers finer spatial resolution but its comparative advantages for person identification remain unexplored.

Method: Conducted first comparative study using synchronized measurements from both frequency bands with COTS Wi-Fi. Applied identical training pipelines and model configurations across both bands using end-to-end deep learning with effective background subtraction.

Result: mmWave Wi-Fi signals achieved high identification accuracy of 91.2% on 20 individuals even at low sampling rates (10 Hz) when combined with background subtraction.

Conclusion: mmWave Wi-Fi signals demonstrate superior performance for person identification compared to sub-6 GHz, offering high accuracy with low sampling requirements, making them promising for practical applications.

Abstract: Person identification plays a vital role in enabling intelligent,
personalized, and secure human-computer interaction. Recent research has
demonstrated the feasibility of leveraging Wi-Fi signals for passive person
identification using a person's unique gait pattern. Although most existing
work focuses on sub-6 GHz frequencies, the emergence of mmWave offers new
opportunities through its finer spatial resolution, though its comparative
advantages for person identification remain unexplored. This work presents the
first comparative study between sub-6 GHz and mmWave Wi-Fi signals for person
identification with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Wi-Fi, using a novel
dataset of synchronized measurements from the two frequency bands in an indoor
environment. To ensure a fair comparison, we apply identical training pipelines
and model configurations across both frequency bands. Leveraging end-to-end
deep learning, we show that even at low sampling rates (10 Hz), mmWave Wi-Fi
signals can achieve high identification accuracy (91.2% on 20 individuals) when
combined with effective background subtraction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid framework combining autoregressive and non-autoregressive models for biological sequence generation, using cross-decoder attention to integrate bidirectional features into AR generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR models fail to capture bidirectional dependencies in biological tasks like peptide sequencing, while NAR models struggle with generative coherence and scalability.

Method: Shared encoder with two decoders: NAR decoder learns bidirectional features, AR decoder generates sequences using cross-decoder attention to query these features. Uses importance annealing and gradient blocking for training stability.

Result: Substantially outperforms AR and NAR baselines on nine-species peptide sequencing benchmark, harmonizing AR stability with NAR contextual awareness.

Conclusion: Advances biological sequence modeling by augmenting AR models with bidirectional understanding, providing a novel architectural paradigm for complex sequence generation.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models, common in sequence generation, are limited in
many biological tasks such as de novo peptide sequencing and protein modeling
by their unidirectional nature, failing to capture crucial global bidirectional
token dependencies. Non-Autoregressive (NAR) models offer holistic,
bidirectional representations but face challenges with generative coherence and
scalability. To transcend this, we propose a hybrid framework enhancing AR
generation by dynamically integrating rich contextual information from
non-autoregressive mechanisms. Our approach couples a shared input encoder with
two decoders: a non-autoregressive one learning latent bidirectional biological
features, and an AR decoder synthesizing the biological sequence by leveraging
these bidirectional features. A novel cross-decoder attention module enables
the AR decoder to iteratively query and integrate these bidirectional features,
enriching its predictions. This synergy is cultivated via a tailored training
strategy with importance annealing for balanced objectives and cross-decoder
gradient blocking for stable, focused learning. Evaluations on a demanding
nine-species benchmark of de novo peptide sequencing show that our model
substantially surpasses AR and NAR baselines. It uniquely harmonizes AR
stability with NAR contextual awareness, delivering robust, superior
performance on diverse downstream data. This research advances biological
sequence modeling techniques and contributes a novel architectural paradigm for
augmenting AR models with enhanced bidirectional understanding for complex
sequence generation. Code is available at https://github.com/BEAM-Labs/denovo.

*Jiaan Luo,Feng Hong,Qiang Hu,Xiaofeng Cao,Feng Liu,Jiangchao Yao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MORE is a model rebalancing framework that addresses long-tailed recognition by directly rebalancing the model's parameter space using low-rank components, improving tail class performance without increasing model complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-tailed recognition is challenging due to skewed class distributions that prevent model generalization to tail classes, and existing methods struggle with consistent improvement in broad scenarios like multi-label tasks.

Method: Introduces a low-rank parameter component to mediate parameter space allocation guided by a tailored loss and sinusoidal reweighting schedule, without increasing overall model complexity or inference costs.

Result: Extensive experiments on diverse long-tailed benchmarks show significant improvement in generalization, particularly for tail classes, and effective complementarity with existing imbalance mitigation methods.

Conclusion: MORE serves as a robust plug-and-play module for long-tailed settings, demonstrating potential through direct parameter space rebalancing.

Abstract: Long-tailed recognition is ubiquitous and challenging in deep learning and
even in the downstream finetuning of foundation models, since the skew class
distribution generally prevents the model generalization to the tail classes.
Despite the promise of previous methods from the perspectives of data
augmentation, loss rebalancing and decoupled training etc., consistent
improvement in the broad scenarios like multi-label long-tailed recognition is
difficult. In this study, we dive into the essential model capacity impact
under long-tailed context, and propose a novel framework, Model Rebalancing
(MORE), which mitigates imbalance by directly rebalancing the model's parameter
space. Specifically, MORE introduces a low-rank parameter component to mediate
the parameter space allocation guided by a tailored loss and sinusoidal
reweighting schedule, but without increasing the overall model complexity or
inference costs. Extensive experiments on diverse long-tailed benchmarks,
spanning multi-class and multi-label tasks, demonstrate that MORE significantly
improves generalization, particularly for tail classes, and effectively
complements existing imbalance mitigation methods. These results highlight
MORE's potential as a robust plug-and-play module in long-tailed settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: D-SINK is a framework that synergistically combines 'weak' auxiliary models specialized for class imbalance or label noise to handle both challenges simultaneously through optimal transport-based distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world datasets often have both class imbalance and label noise, but existing methods struggle to combine solutions for both issues effectively due to conflicting optimization strategies.

Method: Proposes Dual-granularity Sinkhorn Distillation (D-SINK) that uses optimal transport to align sample-level predictions with noise-robust auxiliary models and class distributions with imbalance-robust auxiliary models.

Result: Extensive experiments show D-SINK significantly improves robustness and achieves strong performance on long-tailed noisy data benchmarks.

Conclusion: Leveraging complementary 'weak' auxiliary models through optimal transport distillation provides an effective approach for handling both class imbalance and label noise simultaneously.

Abstract: Real-world datasets for deep learning frequently suffer from the co-occurring
challenges of class imbalance and label noise, hindering model performance.
While methods exist for each issue, effectively combining them is non-trivial,
as distinguishing genuine tail samples from noisy data proves difficult, often
leading to conflicting optimization strategies. This paper presents a novel
perspective: instead of primarily developing new complex techniques from
scratch, we explore synergistically leveraging well-established, individually
'weak' auxiliary models - specialized for tackling either class imbalance or
label noise but not both. This view is motivated by the insight that class
imbalance (a distributional-level concern) and label noise (a sample-level
concern) operate at different granularities, suggesting that robustness
mechanisms for each can in principle offer complementary strengths without
conflict. We propose Dual-granularity Sinkhorn Distillation (D-SINK), a novel
framework that enhances dual robustness by distilling and integrating
complementary insights from such 'weak', single-purpose auxiliary models.
Specifically, D-SINK uses an optimal transport-optimized surrogate label
allocation to align the target model's sample-level predictions with a
noise-robust auxiliary and its class distributions with an imbalance-robust
one. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that D-SINK
significantly improves robustness and achieves strong empirical performance in
learning from long-tailed noisy data.

*Justus Viga,Penelope Mueck,Alexander Löser,Torben Weis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new ship fuel consumption dataset, establishes a standardized benchmark, and demonstrates that foundation models with in-context learning can effectively predict ship fuel consumption, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of ship fuel consumption is crucial for economic efficiency and environmental sustainability in shipping, but heterogeneous methodologies and limited high-quality datasets hinder direct comparison of modeling approaches.

Method: The authors introduce a new dataset with operational and environmental data from three ships, define standardized benchmarks for tabular and time-series regression, and investigate in-context learning using the TabPFN foundation model for ship consumption modeling.

Result: Models incorporating environmental conditions consistently outperform simple polynomial baselines. TabPFN slightly outperforms other techniques, and including temporal context improves accuracy. All evaluated models show strong performance, supporting feasibility of onboard, data-driven fuel prediction.

Conclusion: Foundation models with in-context learning capabilities show promising potential for tabular prediction in ship fuel consumption modeling, with environmental factors and temporal context being important contributors to prediction accuracy.

Abstract: In the shipping industry, fuel consumption and emissions are critical factors
due to their significant impact on economic efficiency and environmental
sustainability. Accurate prediction of ship fuel consumption is essential for
further optimization of maritime operations. However, heterogeneous
methodologies and limited high-quality datasets hinder direct comparison of
modeling approaches. This paper makes three key contributions: (1) we introduce
and release a new dataset
(https://huggingface.co/datasets/krohnedigital/FuelCast) comprising operational
and environmental data from three ships; (2) we define a standardized benchmark
covering tabular regression and time-series regression (3) we investigate the
application of in-context learning for ship consumption modeling using the
TabPFN foundation model - a first in this domain to our knowledge. Our results
demonstrate strong performance across all evaluated models, supporting the
feasibility of onboard, data-driven fuel prediction. Models incorporating
environmental conditions consistently outperform simple polynomial baselines
relying solely on vessel speed. TabPFN slightly outperforms other techniques,
highlighting the potential of foundation models with in-context learning
capabilities for tabular prediction. Furthermore, including temporal context
improves accuracy.

### [280] [Expressive Value Learning for Scalable Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08218)
*Nicolas Espinosa-Dice,Kiante Brantley,Wen Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EVOR is a scalable offline RL method that integrates expressive policies and value functions using flow matching, avoiding distillation and BPTT through inference-time policy extraction via rejection sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL needs to scale to complex datasets but existing methods rely on computationally expensive BPTT or error-prone policy distillation, limiting scalability.

Method: EVOR learns an optimal regularized Q-function via flow matching during training, then performs inference-time policy extraction using rejection sampling against the expressive value function.

Result: EVOR outperforms baselines on diverse offline RL tasks, demonstrating the benefit of expressive value learning.

Conclusion: Integrating expressive value learning into offline RL enables scalable, efficient optimization without retraining or distillation errors.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful paradigm for learning to make
sequences of decisions. However, RL has yet to be fully leveraged in robotics,
principally due to its lack of scalability. Offline RL offers a promising
avenue by training agents on large, diverse datasets, avoiding the costly
real-world interactions of online RL. Scaling offline RL to increasingly
complex datasets requires expressive generative models such as diffusion and
flow matching. However, existing methods typically depend on either
backpropagation through time (BPTT), which is computationally prohibitive, or
policy distillation, which introduces compounding errors and limits scalability
to larger base policies. In this paper, we consider the question of how to
develop a scalable offline RL approach without relying on distillation or
backpropagation through time. We introduce Expressive Value Learning for
Offline Reinforcement Learning (EVOR): a scalable offline RL approach that
integrates both expressive policies and expressive value functions. EVOR learns
an optimal, regularized Q-function via flow matching during training. At
inference-time, EVOR performs inference-time policy extraction via rejection
sampling against the expressive value function, enabling efficient
optimization, regularization, and compute-scalable search without retraining.
Empirically, we show that EVOR outperforms baselines on a diverse set of
offline RL tasks, demonstrating the benefit of integrating expressive value
learning into offline RL.

*Wiktor Jan Hoffmann,Sonia Laguna,Moritz Vandenhirtz,Emanuele Palumbo,Julia E. Vogt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PSCBMs enhance pre-trained CBMs by adding a small covariance module to model concept dependencies, improving accuracy and intervention performance without full retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CBMs with concept dependencies require full retraining, which is impractical when original data or compute resources are limited.

Method: Add a multivariate normal distribution over concepts via a small covariance-prediction module to any pre-trained CBM, without retraining the backbone model.

Result: PSCBMs match or improve concept and target accuracy over standard CBMs, and perform much better under interventions while being more efficient than full retraining.

Conclusion: PSCBMs provide an efficient way to enhance CBMs with concept dependencies, offering improved performance under interventions without the computational cost of full retraining.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) are interpretable models that predict the
target variable through high-level human-understandable concepts, allowing
users to intervene on mispredicted concepts to adjust the final output. While
recent work has shown that modeling dependencies between concepts can improve
CBM performance, especially under interventions, such approaches typically
require retraining the entire model, which may be infeasible when access to the
original data or compute is limited. In this paper, we introduce Post-hoc
Stochastic Concept Bottleneck Models (PSCBMs), a lightweight method that
augments any pre-trained CBM with a multivariate normal distribution over
concepts by adding only a small covariance-prediction module, without
retraining the backbone model. We propose two training strategies and show on
real-world data that PSCBMs consistently match or improve both concept and
target accuracy over standard CBMs at test time. Furthermore, we show that due
to the modeling of concept dependencies, PSCBMs perform much better than CBMs
under interventions, while remaining far more efficient than retraining a
similar stochastic model from scratch.

*Michal Koren,Or Peretz,Tai Dinh,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UAMDP framework integrates Bayesian forecasting, posterior-sampling RL, and CVaR-constrained planning for robust sequential decision-making under uncertainty, showing improved performance in trading and inventory control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sequential decisions in volatile, high-stakes settings require principled uncertainty management beyond just maximizing expected return.

Method: Uncertainty-Aware Markov Decision Process (UAMDP) couples Bayesian forecasting, posterior-sampling reinforcement learning, and planning under conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) constraints in a closed loop.

Result: UAMDP improves long-horizon forecasting accuracy (RMSE decreases by up to 25%, sMAPE by 32%), increases trading Sharpe ratio from 1.54 to 1.74, and roughly halves maximum drawdown in high-frequency trading and retail inventory control.

Conclusion: Integrating calibrated probabilistic modeling, exploration aligned with posterior uncertainty, and risk-aware control yields a robust, generalizable approach to safer and more profitable sequential decision-making.

Abstract: Sequential decisions in volatile, high-stakes settings require more than
maximizing expected return; they require principled uncertainty management.
This paper presents the Uncertainty-Aware Markov Decision Process (UAMDP), a
unified framework that couples Bayesian forecasting, posterior-sampling
reinforcement learning, and planning under a conditional value-at-risk (CVaR)
constraint. In a closed loop, the agent updates its beliefs over latent
dynamics, samples plausible futures via Thompson sampling, and optimizes
policies subject to preset risk tolerances. We establish regret bounds that
converge to the Bayes-optimal benchmark under standard regularity conditions.
We evaluate UAMDP in two domains-high-frequency equity trading and retail
inventory control-both marked by structural uncertainty and economic
volatility. Relative to strong deep learning baselines, UAMDP improves
long-horizon forecasting accuracy (RMSE decreases by up to 25\% and sMAPE by
32\%), and these gains translate into economic performance: the trading Sharpe
ratio rises from 1.54 to 1.74 while maximum drawdown is roughly halved. These
results show that integrating calibrated probabilistic modeling, exploration
aligned with posterior uncertainty, and risk-aware control yields a robust,
generalizable approach to safer and more profitable sequential decision-making.

*Yuchen Zhu,Wei Guo,Jaemoo Choi,Petr Molodyk,Bo Yuan,Molei Tao,Yongxin Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DMPO is a reinforcement learning method designed specifically for diffusion large language models (dLLMs) to enhance reasoning capabilities by matching policy distributions to optimal reward-tilted ones through cross-entropy optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: dLLMs are promising alternatives to autoregressive LLMs for higher inference throughput, but lack suitable RL algorithms to achieve comparable performance on reasoning tasks.

Method: Distribution Matching Policy Optimization (DMPO) - a principled RL fine-tuning method that matches dLLM policy distribution to optimal reward-tilted distribution using cross-entropy optimization, with novel weight baseline subtraction to address small batch size challenges.

Result: Superior performance on multiple reasoning benchmarks without supervised fine-tuning, achieving up to 42.9% accuracy improvement over SOTA baselines and 55.8% over base model.

Conclusion: DMPO effectively enhances dLLM reasoning capabilities through the distribution matching framework, demonstrating significant performance gains over existing methods.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are promising alternatives to
autoregressive large language models (AR-LLMs), as they potentially allow
higher inference throughput. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a crucial component
for dLLMs to achieve comparable performance with AR-LLMs on important tasks,
such as reasoning. However, RL algorithms that are well-suited for dLLMs'
unique characteristics have yet to be developed. This paper proposes
Distribution Matching Policy Optimization (DMPO), a principled and
theoretically grounded RL fine-tuning method specifically designed to enhance
the reasoning capabilities of dLLMs by matching the dLLM policy distribution to
the optimal, reward-tilted one through cross-entropy optimization. We identify
a key challenge in the implementation with a small training batch size and
propose several effective solutions through a novel weight baseline subtraction
technique. DMPO exhibits superior performance on multiple reasoning benchmarks
without supervised fine-tuning, with an accuracy improvement of up to $42.9\%$
over previously SOTA baselines and $55.8\%$ over the base model, underscoring
the effectiveness of the distribution matching framework. Our code is available

*Konrad Löhr,Shuzhou Yuan,Michael Färber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates political bias and stereotypes in eight major LLMs using the Political Compass Test, finding consistent left-leaning alignment and more pronounced implicit stereotypes through language variation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding political biases in LLMs is crucial as they increasingly influence information dissemination and decision-making, potentially affecting public opinion and democratic processes.

Method: Used the two-dimensional Political Compass Test (PCT) to assess inherent political leanings, employed persona prompting to explore explicit stereotypes, and evaluated implicit stereotypes using multilingual PCT versions.

Result: All investigated models showed consistent left-leaning political alignment. Implicit stereotypes elicited through language variation were more pronounced than explicit ones, with notable alignment between implicit and explicit stereotypes suggesting model awareness of biases.

Conclusion: The study reveals complex interplay between political bias and stereotypes in LLMs, highlighting the need for awareness and mitigation of these biases as models influence societal information systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increas- ingly integral to information
dissemination and decision-making processes. Given their grow- ing societal
influence, understanding potential biases, particularly within the political
domain, is crucial to prevent undue influence on public opinion and democratic
processes. This work investigates political bias and stereotype propa- gation
across eight prominent LLMs using the two-dimensional Political Compass Test
(PCT). Initially, the PCT is employed to assess the in- herent political
leanings of these models. Sub- sequently, persona prompting with the PCT is
used to explore explicit stereotypes across vari- ous social dimensions. In a
final step, implicit stereotypes are uncovered by evaluating mod- els with
multilingual versions of the PCT. Key findings reveal a consistent left-leaning
polit- ical alignment across all investigated models. Furthermore, while the
nature and extent of stereotypes vary considerably between models, implicit
stereotypes elicited through language variation are more pronounced than those
iden- tified via explicit persona prompting. Interest- ingly, for most models,
implicit and explicit stereotypes show a notable alignment, suggest- ing a
degree of transparency or "awareness" regarding their inherent biases. This
study un- derscores the complex interplay of political bias and stereotypes in
LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First investigation of opponent shaping with LLM agents, showing they can influence co-players' learning dynamics in both competitive and cooperative games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents, understanding strategic behavior in multi-agent systems becomes essential. The paper addresses whether LLM agents can shape others' learning dynamics through interaction alone.

Method: Introduces ShapeLLM, an adaptation of model-free opponent shaping methods tailored for transformer-based agents, addressing limitations of existing OS algorithms that require higher-order derivatives or specific architectural components.

Result: LLM agents successfully guided opponents toward exploitable equilibria in competitive games (Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, Matching Pennies, Chicken) and promoted coordination/improved collective welfare in cooperative games (Iterated Stag Hunt, cooperative Prisoner's Dilemma).

Conclusion: LLM agents can both shape and be shaped through interaction, establishing opponent shaping as a key dimension of multi-agent LLM research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as autonomous
agents in real-world environments. As these deployments scale, multi-agent
interactions become inevitable, making it essential to understand strategic
behavior in such systems. A central open question is whether LLM agents, like
reinforcement learning agents, can shape the learning dynamics and influence
the behavior of others through interaction alone. In this paper, we present the
first investigation of opponent shaping (OS) with LLM-based agents. Existing OS
algorithms cannot be directly applied to LLMs, as they require higher-order
derivatives, face scalability constraints, or depend on architectural
components that are absent in transformers. To address this gap, we introduce
ShapeLLM, an adaptation of model-free OS methods tailored for transformer-based
agents. Using ShapeLLM, we examine whether LLM agents can influence co-players'
learning dynamics across diverse game-theoretic environments. We demonstrate
that LLM agents can successfully guide opponents toward exploitable equilibria
in competitive games (Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, Matching Pennies, and
Chicken) and promote coordination and improve collective welfare in cooperative
games (Iterated Stag Hunt and a cooperative version of the Prisoner's Dilemma).
Our findings show that LLM agents can both shape and be shaped through
interaction, establishing opponent shaping as a key dimension of multi-agent
LLM research.

*Jason Bohne,Pawel Polak,David Rosenberg,Brian Bloniarz,Gary Kazantsev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mix- and MoE-DPO extends Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with mixture models and mixture-of-experts architectures using stochastic variational inference, enabling better handling of multi-task settings and diverse preference distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard DPO relies on a single monolithic model, limiting expressivity in multi-task settings and adaptability to heterogeneous preference distributions.

Method: Proposes a latent-variable model over expert assignments and optimizes a variational evidence lower bound (ELBO), using both soft mixture models and mixture-of-experts architectures with stochastic variational inference.

Result: The framework provides three key advantages: universal function approximation via mixtures, reward/policy specialization through expert components, and contextual alignment through input-dependent soft gating.

Conclusion: Mix- and MoE-DPO offers a powerful and scalable method for preference-based LLM alignment that outperforms standard DPO in multi-preference settings.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently emerged as a simple and
effective alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for
aligning large language models (LLMs) with user preferences. However, existing
DPO formulations rely on a single monolithic model, which limits their
expressivity in multi-task settings and their adaptability to heterogeneous or
diverse preference distributions. In this work, we propose Mix- and MoE-DPO, a
framework that extends DPO with both soft mixture models and mixture-of-experts
(MoE) architectures, using a stochastic variational inference approach. Our
method introduces a latent-variable model over expert assignments and optimizes
a variational evidence lower bound (ELBO), enabling stable and efficient
learning of specialized expert policies from preference data. Mix- and MoE-DPO
provides three key advantages over standard DPO: (i) generalization via
universal function approximation through mixtures; (ii) reward and policy
specialization through expert components tailored to distinct preference modes;
and (iii) contextual alignment through input-dependent soft gating that enables
user-specific mixture policies. Our framework supports both shared base
architectures with expert-specific policy heads and fully independent expert
models, allowing flexible trade-offs between parameter efficiency and
specialization. We validate our approach on a variety of model sizes and
multi-preference datasets, demonstrating that Mix- and MoE-DPO offers a
powerful and scalable method for preference-based LLM alignment.

TL;DR: This paper establishes a foundation for multivariate counterfactual identification using continuous-time flows, addressing the lack of identification in recent counterfactual inference methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent counterfactual inference methods lack proper identification, undermining causal validity. Pearl argues counterfactuals must be identifiable from observed data to justify causal claims.

Method: Uses continuous-time flows and flow matching with tools from dynamic optimal transport to create unique, monotone and rank-preserving counterfactual transport maps, including non-Markovian settings.

Result: Validated theory in controlled scenarios with counterfactual ground-truth and demonstrated improvements in axiomatic counterfactual soundness on real images.

Conclusion: The approach provides a theoretically sound foundation for counterfactual identification in high-dimensional multivariate settings, ensuring consistent inference.

Abstract: We address the open question of counterfactual identification for
high-dimensional multivariate outcomes from observational data. Pearl (2000)
argues that counterfactuals must be identifiable (i.e., recoverable from the
observed data distribution) to justify causal claims. A recent line of work on
counterfactual inference shows promising results but lacks identification,
undermining the causal validity of its estimates. To address this, we establish
a foundation for multivariate counterfactual identification using
continuous-time flows, including non-Markovian settings under standard
criteria. We characterise the conditions under which flow matching yields a
unique, monotone and rank-preserving counterfactual transport map with tools
from dynamic optimal transport, ensuring consistent inference. Building on
this, we validate the theory in controlled scenarios with counterfactual
ground-truth and demonstrate improvements in axiomatic counterfactual soundness
on real images.

Conclusion: The framework introduces a new paradigm of physics-informed inductive bias that successfully embeds physical hierarchy into generative models.

Abstract: Conventional time-series generation often ignores domain-specific physical

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: As AI becomes a native component of 6G network control, AI models must adapt
to continuously changing conditions, including the introduction of new features
and measurements driven by multi-vendor deployments, hardware upgrades, and
evolving service requirements. To address this growing need for flexible
learning in non-stationary environments, this vision paper highlights Adaptive
Random Forests (ARFs) as a reliable solution for dynamic feature adaptation in
communication network scenarios. We show that iterative training of ARFs can
effectively lead to stable predictions, with accuracy improving over time as
more features are added. In addition, we highlight the importance of
explainability in AI-driven networks, proposing Drift-Aware Feature Importance
(DAFI) as an efficient XAI feature importance (FI) method. DAFI uses a
distributional drift detector to signal when to apply computationally intensive
FI methods instead of lighter alternatives. Our tests on 3 different datasets
indicate that our approach reduces runtime by up to 2 times, while producing
more consistent feature importance values. Together, ARFs and DAFI provide a
promising framework to build flexible AI methods adapted to 6G network
use-cases.

*Abdellah El Mrini,Sadegh Farhadkhan,Rachid Guerraoui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RPEL is a decentralized collaborative learning approach that uses pull-based epidemic communication to achieve robustness against adversarial nodes while scaling efficiently with O(n log n) communication costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing collaborative ML approaches either rely on central servers (single point of failure) or have high O(n²) communication costs, making them impractical for large-scale deployments with adversarial nodes.

Method: Uses pull-based epidemic communication where nodes randomly select small subsets of peers to pull model parameters from, eliminating the need for central coordination while maintaining convergence guarantees with high probability.

Result: RPEL maintains robustness in adversarial settings, achieves accuracy comparable to all-to-all communication, and scales efficiently across large networks with significantly reduced communication overhead.

Conclusion: RPEL provides a scalable, decentralized solution for robust collaborative learning that overcomes the limitations of both centralized approaches and traditional distributed methods with quadratic communication costs.

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning is challenged by training-time adversarial
behaviors. Existing approaches to tolerate such behaviors either rely on a
central server or induce high communication costs. We propose Robust Pull-based
Epidemic Learning (RPEL), a novel, scalable collaborative approach to ensure
robust learning despite adversaries. RPEL does not rely on any central server
and, unlike traditional methods, where communication costs grow in
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ with the number of nodes $n$, RPEL employs a pull-based
epidemic-based communication strategy that scales in $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$.
By pulling model parameters from small random subsets of nodes, RPEL
significantly lowers the number of required messages without compromising
convergence guarantees, which hold with high probability. Empirical results
demonstrate that RPEL maintains robustness in adversarial settings, competes
with all-to-all communication accuracy, and scales efficiently across large
networks.

*Andrea Pugnana,Giovanni De Toni,Cesare Barbera,Roberto Pellungrini,Bruno Lepri,Andrea Passerini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Learning to Ask (LtA) is a new framework that enables ML models to determine both when and how to incorporate expert human feedback, going beyond traditional Learning to Defer approaches by allowing richer human-AI collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Learning to Defer (LtD) treats humans and ML models as mutually exclusive decision-makers, limiting expert contribution to mere predictions. This restricts the potential for more sophisticated human-AI collaboration.

Method: LtA uses a two-part architecture with a standard ML model and an enriched model trained with additional expert feedback, plus an optimal strategy for selecting when to query the enriched model. Two implementations: sequential (stage-wise training) and joint (simultaneous optimization with surrogate losses having realisable-consistency guarantees).

Result: Experiments with synthetic and real expert data show that LtA provides a more flexible and powerful foundation for effective human-AI collaboration compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: LtA successfully addresses limitations of Learning to Defer by enabling richer human-AI interaction, allowing ML models to determine both when and how to incorporate expert input for improved classification performance.

Abstract: Developing decision-support systems that complement human performance in
classification tasks remains an open challenge. A popular approach, Learning to
Defer (LtD), allows a Machine Learning (ML) model to pass difficult cases to a
human expert. However, LtD treats humans and ML models as mutually exclusive
decision-makers, restricting the expert contribution to mere predictions. To
address this limitation, we propose Learning to Ask (LtA), a new framework that
handles both when and how to incorporate expert input in an ML model. LtA is
based on a two-part architecture: a standard ML model and an enriched model
trained with additional expert human feedback, with a formally optimal strategy
for selecting when to query the enriched model. We provide two practical
implementations of LtA: a sequential approach, which trains the models in
stages, and a joint approach, which optimises them simultaneously. For the
latter, we design surrogate losses with realisable-consistency guarantees. Our
experiments with synthetic and real expert data demonstrate that LtA provides a
more flexible and powerful foundation for effective human-AI collaboration.

TL;DR: The paper studies length generalization in transformers using the set complement task, showing theoretical bounds and practical limitations due to softmax compression and noisy updates, with dropout and EMA improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand length generalization in transformers, particularly for board-game style reasoning tasks where models must predict tokens absent from input sequences.

Method: Theoretical analysis of single-layer attention-only transformers, mechanistic proof interpretation, and empirical validation through hyperparameter search on set complement task and testing OthelloGPT.

Result: Proved tight bounds on embedding dimensions, showed balanced logit displacement enables length generalization with reduced precision, and validated that dropout and EMA improve generalization.

Conclusion: Length generalization in transformers faces limitations from softmax compression and noisy updates, but these can be mitigated through dropout and EMA techniques.

Abstract: We study length generalization in transformers through the set complement
task, where a model must predict a uniform distribution over tokens absent from
an input sequence -- an ability central to board-game style reasoning. Our main
theoretical result establishes two statements. First, we prove tight bounds on
embedding and value dimensions for single-layer attention-only transformers.
Second, we show that if such a model achieves balanced logit displacement at
lengths 1 and 2, then it must generalize to longer sequences, though with
reduced precision. A mechanistic reading of the proof explains this limitation:
as more tokens are attended to, softmax compresses logit displacements, eroding
separation between valid and invalid outputs. Training dynamics also suggest a
second obstacle: when many next tokens are possible, updates become noisy. We
hypothesize that dropout can counteract the first effect and Exponential Moving
Average (EMA) the second. We validate these hypotheses through random
hyperparameter search on the set complement task, which confirms both
mechanisms. We then test OthelloGPT, a GPT-1 style model trained on random
Othello moves, and find that EMA again improves length generalization in this
more complex setting.

TL;DR: DeepEN is a deep reinforcement learning framework that provides personalized enteral nutrition recommendations for ICU patients, achieving better outcomes than clinician-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve enteral nutrition therapy for critically ill patients by moving beyond traditional guideline-based approaches to personalized, data-driven recommendations that adapt to each patient's evolving physiology.

Method: Used deep reinforcement learning with a dueling double deep Q-network and conservative Q-learning regularization, trained offline on over 11,000 ICU patients from MIMIC-IV database. The framework integrates clinically informed state space with custom reward function balancing short-term physiological goals and long-term survival outcomes.

Result: DeepEN achieved a 3.7 percentage-point reduction in estimated mortality (18.8% vs 22.5%) and improvements in key nutritional biomarkers, outperforming both clinician-derived and guideline-based policies across various qualitative and quantitative metrics.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the potential of safe, data-driven personalization of enteral nutrition therapy to improve patient outcomes beyond traditional approaches.

Abstract: We introduce DeepEN, a deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework for
personalized enteral nutrition (EN) in critically ill patients. Trained offline
on over 11,000 ICU patients from the MIMIC-IV database, DeepEN generates
4-hourly recommendations for caloric, protein, and fluid intake tailored to
each patient's evolving physiology. The model integrates a curated, clinically
informed state space with a custom reward function that balances short-term
physiological and nutrition-related goals with long-term survival outcomes.
Using a dueling double deep Q-network with conservative Q-learning
regularization, DeepEN learns clinically realistic policies that align with
high-value clinician actions while discouraging unsafe deviations. Across
various qualitative and quantitative metrics, DeepEN outperforms
clinician-derived and guideline-based policies, achieving a 3.7 $\pm$ 0.17
percentage-point reduction in estimated mortality (18.8% vs 22.5%) and
improvements in key nutritional biomarkers. These findings highlight the
potential of safe, data-driven personalization of EN therapy to improve

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel sampling algorithm for pre-trained masked diffusion models that improves sample quality and efficiency through a star-shaped paradigm with learnable re-masking scheduler, particularly effective in low-step generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained masked diffusion models are constrained by irreversible sampling decisions and struggle with low-step generation, limiting their practical efficiency.

Method: Reformulates generation using star-shaped paradigm for error correction, augmented with learnable re-masking scheduler that identifies and revises likely errors. Requires lightweight fine-tuning of a single layer.

Result: Substantial quality boost in low-step regimes, outperforms or matches existing methods in text and code generation experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed sampling algorithm effectively addresses limitations of traditional diffusion model sampling by enabling error correction and intelligent re-masking, significantly improving performance with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: The performance of pre-trained masked diffusion models is often constrained
by their sampling procedure, which makes decisions irreversible and struggles
in low-step generation regimes. We introduce a novel sampling algorithm that
works with pre-trained models and, after a lightweight fine-tuning of a single
layer, significantly improves sample quality and efficiency. Our method
reformulates the generation process using a star-shaped paradigm, which
inherently allows for error correction. To make this process effective, we
augment it with a learnable re-masking scheduler that intelligently identifies
and revises likely errors. This approach yields a substantial quality boost,
particularly when using a small number of sampling steps. We extensively ablate
key components of our approach and show its usability in different scenarios.
In comprehensive experiments on text, and code generation, our sampling
algorithm outperforms or matches existing methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the practical feasibility of deploying contrastive learning frameworks on resource-constrained edge and fog devices, finding that SimCLR has the lowest energy consumption despite its perceived computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contrastive learning shows promise for self-supervised representation learning but its deployment on resource-constrained devices remains underexplored due to substantial computational demands, energy consumption, data availability, and memory usage challenges.

Method: Systematic benchmarking of four CL frameworks (SimCLR, MoCo, SimSiam, Barlow Twins) with energy profiling and reduced training data conditions, plus evaluation of lightweight neural architectures paired with CL frameworks.

Result: SimCLR demonstrates the lowest energy consumption across various data regimes, contrary to its perceived computational cost.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into resource implications of deploying CL in edge/fog environments and opens research directions for future optimization of contrastive learning on devices with limited processing capabilities.

Abstract: While contrastive learning (CL) shows considerable promise in self-supervised
representation learning, its deployment on resource-constrained devices remains
largely underexplored. The substantial computational demands required for
training conventional CL frameworks pose a set of challenges, particularly in
terms of energy consumption, data availability, and memory usage. We conduct an
evaluation of four widely used CL frameworks: SimCLR, MoCo, SimSiam, and Barlow
Twins. We focus on the practical feasibility of these CL frameworks for edge
and fog deployment, and introduce a systematic benchmarking strategy that
includes energy profiling and reduced training data conditions. Our findings
reveal that SimCLR, contrary to its perceived computational cost, demonstrates
the lowest energy consumption across various data regimes. Finally, we also
extend our analysis by evaluating lightweight neural architectures when paired
with CL frameworks. Our study aims to provide insights into the resource
implications of deploying CL in edge/fog environments with limited processing
capabilities and opens several research directions for its future optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when hypothesis classes are learnable with forgiving 0-1 loss functions in multiclass settings.

Method: Created a new combinatorial dimension based on Natarajan Dimension and established equivalence between learnability and finiteness of this dimension.

Result: Showed that a hypothesis class is learnable with forgiving 0-1 loss if and only if the Generalized Natarajan Dimension is finite.

Conclusion: Learnability of set learning problems is characterized by the Natarajan Dimension, with connections to learning with set-valued feedback.

Abstract: In this paper we will give a characterization of the learnability of
forgiving 0-1 loss functions in the finite label multiclass setting. To do
this, we create a new combinatorial dimension that is based off of the
Natarajan Dimension \citep{natarajan1989learning} and we show that a hypothesis

*Heming Zou,Yunliang Zang,Wutong Xu,Yao Zhu,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlyLoRA is a novel LoRA variant inspired by the fly olfactory circuit that eliminates explicit routers through rank-wise expert activation and implicit routing using frozen sparse random projection matrices, improving both intra-task decorrelation and inter-task interference mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA suffers from parameter interference in fine-tuning, and existing MoE-based variants introduce additional router parameters while remaining ineffective for multi-task model merging due to inter-task interference.

Method: Proposes FlyLoRA with: (1) rank-wise expert activation in up-projection matrix, and (2) implicit router that unifies expert routing and down-projection using frozen sparse random projection matrices instead of dense trainable ones.

Result: Extensive experiments across four domains (general knowledge, scientific QA, mathematical reasoning, code generation) show consistent performance improvements over existing methods.

Conclusion: FlyLoRA demonstrates how biological structures can inspire AI innovations, providing better parameter efficiency and interference mitigation without explicit routers.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used parameter-efficient fine-tuning
method for foundation models, but it suffers from parameter interference,
resulting in suboptimal performance. Although Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based
LoRA variants show promise in mitigating intra-task correlations in single-task
instruction tuning, they introduce additional router parameters and remain
ineffective in multi-task model merging where inter-task interference arises.
Inspired by the fly olfactory circuit, we propose FlyLoRA, an implicit
MoE-based LoRA variant that introduces: (1) rank-wise expert activation in the
up-projection matrix, and (2) an implicit router that unifies expert routing
and down-projection, where a frozen sparse random projection matrix replaces
the traditional dense trainable version. This design resolves the trade-off
between intra-task decorrelation and computational efficiency by eliminating
the need for an explicit router, while inherently mitigating inter-task
interference due to the orthogonality property of random matrices. Extensive
experiments across four domains -- general knowledge understanding, scientific
question answering, mathematical reasoning, and code generation -- demonstrate
consistent performance improvements over existing methods. Beyond empirical
gains, FlyLoRA highlights how biological structures can inspire innovations in
AI technologies. Code is available at https://github.com/gfyddha/FlyLoRA.

### [298] [Biology-driven assessment of deep learning super-resolution imaging of the porosity network in dentin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08407)
*Lauren Anderson,Lucas Chatelain,Nicolas Tremblay,Kathryn Grandfield,David Rousseau,Aurélien Gourrier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep learning super-resolution models were tested to enhance confocal microscopy images of dental porosity, but standard image quality metrics failed to match visual perception, requiring biology-driven assessment methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitation of small field of view in high-resolution confocal microscopy of dental porosity by using deep learning super-resolution to restore image quality from faster low-resolution acquisitions.

Method: Tested three supervised 2D SR models (RCAN, pix2pix, FSRCNN) and one unsupervised model (CycleGAN) on paired high- and low-resolution confocal images with pixel size increases of x2, x4, x8. Used segmentation and graph analysis to evaluate 3D porosity connectivity preservation.

Result: Standard image quality assessment metrics yielded inconsistent results that contradicted visual perception. Biology-driven assessment using segmentation and graph analysis revealed differences in model sensitivity to weak intensity features and impact of non-linearity in image generation.

Conclusion: Generic image quality metrics are inadequate for evaluating super-resolution performance on dental porosity structures. Biology-driven assessment methods provide better mechanistic interpretation and reveal limitations of standard metrics.

Abstract: The mechanosensory system of teeth is currently believed to partly rely on
Odontoblast cells stimulation by fluid flow through a porosity network
extending through dentin. Visualizing the smallest sub-microscopic porosity
vessels therefore requires the highest achievable resolution from confocal
fluorescence microscopy, the current gold standard. This considerably limits
the extent of the field of view to very small sample regions. To overcome this
limitation, we tested different deep learning (DL) super-resolution (SR) models
to allow faster experimental acquisitions of lower resolution images and
restore optimal image quality by post-processing. Three supervised 2D SR models
(RCAN, pix2pix, FSRCNN) and one unsupervised (CycleGAN) were applied to a
unique set of experimentally paired high- and low-resolution confocal images
acquired with different sampling schemes, resulting in a pixel size increase of
x2, x4, x8. Model performance was quantified using a broad set of similarity
and distribution-based image quality assessment (IQA) metrics, which yielded
inconsistent results that mostly contradicted our visual perception. This
raises the question of the relevance of such generic metrics to efficiently
target the specific structure of dental porosity. To resolve this conflicting
information, the generated SR images were segmented taking into account the
specific scales and morphology of the porosity network and analysed by
comparing connected components. Additionally, the capacity of the SR models to
preserve 3D porosity connectivity throughout the confocal image stacks was
evaluated using graph analysis. This biology-driven assessment allowed a far
better mechanistic interpretation of SR performance, highlighting differences
in model sensitivity to weak intensity features and the impact of non-linearity
in image generation, which explains the failure of standard IQA metrics.

*David Madras,Joshua Safyan,Qiuyi,Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explains why prompt engineering succeeds with limited data by showing that perplexity acts as an effective prior, and derives non-vacuous generalization bounds for data-scarce scenarios through perplexity regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generalization bounds for prompt optimization are non-vacuous only in data-rich scenarios, but prompt engineering often succeeds with small amounts of data. The authors aim to better explain this widespread success.

Method: Derive novel generalization bounds using more useful priors, formally analyze how perplexity regularization tightens bounds by limiting exploration, and empirically evaluate both the bounds' effectiveness and practical benefits of perplexity regularization.

Result: The paper shows that perplexity acts as an effective prior that steers optimization toward more natural prompts, and demonstrates non-vacuous generalization bounds for data-scarce prompt optimization scenarios.

Conclusion: Perplexity regularization improves prompt generalization by providing better priors, and the derived bounds offer theoretical justification for why prompt engineering succeeds even with limited data.

Abstract: Many prompt engineering techniques have been successful in practice, even
when optimizing over a large prompt space with with a small amount of
task-specific data. Recent work has partially explained this success by showing
generalization bounds which apply PAC-Bayes theory to the discrete prompt
space, but they are non-vacuous only in data-rich scenarios. We argue that such
widespread success can be more fully explained through more carefully
considering data- or distribution-dependent perplexity, which acts as an
effective prior and steers the optimization towards prompts that are more
``natural'' for the task at hand. We derive novel generalization bounds that
are non-vacuous for data-scarce prompt optimization via more useful priors,
formally analyzing how perplexity regularization tightens these bounds by
limiting exploration. Empirically, we explore both the bounds' effectiveness
and the practical benefits of perplexity regularization in improving prompt
generalization.

### [300] [Reinforcing Diffusion Models by Direct Group Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08425)
*Yihong Luo,Tianyang Hu,Jing Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DGPO is a new online RL algorithm for diffusion models that learns directly from group-level preferences, enabling use of efficient deterministic ODE samplers instead of slow stochastic policies, achieving 20x faster training with superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods like GRPO require stochastic policies for diffusion models, but efficient diffusion samplers are deterministic ODEs. Using SDE-based samplers for stochasticity leads to slow convergence due to model-agnostic Gaussian noise.

Method: DGPO dispenses with policy-gradient framework and learns directly from group-level preferences using relative information of samples within groups, eliminating need for stochastic policies and enabling use of efficient deterministic ODE samplers.

Result: DGPO trains around 20 times faster than state-of-the-art methods and achieves superior performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain reward metrics.

Conclusion: DGPO resolves the conflict between RL requirements and efficient diffusion sampling by eliminating the need for stochastic policies, enabling faster training and better performance through direct group preference optimization.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative Preference
Optimization (GRPO) have significantly enhanced Large Language Models, adapting
them to diffusion models remains challenging. In particular, GRPO demands a
stochastic policy, yet the most cost-effective diffusion samplers are based on
deterministic ODEs. Recent work addresses this issue by using inefficient
SDE-based samplers to induce stochasticity, but this reliance on model-agnostic
Gaussian noise leads to slow convergence. To resolve this conflict, we propose
Direct Group Preference Optimization (DGPO), a new online RL algorithm that
dispenses with the policy-gradient framework entirely. DGPO learns directly
from group-level preferences, which utilize relative information of samples
within groups. This design eliminates the need for inefficient stochastic
policies, unlocking the use of efficient deterministic ODE samplers and faster
training. Extensive results show that DGPO trains around 20 times faster than
existing state-of-the-art methods and achieves superior performance on both
in-domain and out-of-domain reward metrics. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ClauseLens is a reinforcement learning framework that produces transparent, regulation-compliant reinsurance treaty quotes by embedding legal clauses into both decision-making and explanation processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinsurance treaty pricing practices are opaque and difficult to audit, failing to meet stringent regulatory standards. There's a need for transparent, regulation-compliant quoting systems.

Method: Models quoting as a Risk-Aware Constrained Markov Decision Process (RA-CMDP). Retrieves statutory and policy clauses from legal corpora, embeds them into agent observations, and uses them to constrain actions and generate clause-grounded natural language justifications.

Result: Reduces solvency violations by 51%, improves tail-risk performance by 27.9% (CVaR_0.10), achieves 88.2% accuracy in clause-grounded explanations with 87.4% precision and 91.1% recall.

Conclusion: Embedding legal context into both decision and explanation pathways yields interpretable, auditable, and regulation-aligned quoting behavior compliant with major regulatory frameworks.

Abstract: Reinsurance treaty pricing must satisfy stringent regulatory standards, yet
current quoting practices remain opaque and difficult to audit. We introduce
ClauseLens, a clause-grounded reinforcement learning framework that produces
transparent, regulation-compliant, and risk-aware treaty quotes.
  ClauseLens models the quoting task as a Risk-Aware Constrained Markov
Decision Process (RA-CMDP). Statutory and policy clauses are retrieved from
legal and underwriting corpora, embedded into the agent's observations, and
used both to constrain feasible actions and to generate clause-grounded natural
language justifications.
  Evaluated in a multi-agent treaty simulator calibrated to industry data,
ClauseLens reduces solvency violations by 51%, improves tail-risk performance
by 27.9% (CVaR_0.10), and achieves 88.2% accuracy in clause-grounded
explanations with retrieval precision of 87.4% and recall of 91.1%.
  These findings demonstrate that embedding legal context into both decision
and explanation pathways yields interpretable, auditable, and
regulation-aligned quoting behavior consistent with Solvency II, NAIC RBC, and
the EU AI Act.

TL;DR: xRouter is a learned routing system that uses reinforcement learning to dynamically route queries between expensive premium LLMs and lightweight models, achieving optimal cost-performance trade-offs without manual rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM deployments face a cost-performance dilemma: premium models are expensive but capable, while lightweight models are cheap but unreliable on complex tasks. Static routing rules fail to adapt across different task types and optimize this spectrum.

Method: xRouter uses a tool-calling-based routing system where a learned router can answer directly or invoke external models. It's trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning using explicit cost-aware rewards that encode cost-performance trade-offs.

Result: xRouter achieves strong cost-performance trade-offs across diverse benchmarks, showing substantial cost reductions while maintaining comparable task completion rates. It provides insights into learned routing effectiveness and orchestration behaviors in small models.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates practical learned routing for cost-aware LLM orchestration, with findings and open implementation serving as a foundation for advancing dynamic, cost-efficient model deployment strategies.

Abstract: Modern LLM deployments confront a widening cost-performance spectrum: premium
models deliver strong reasoning but are expensive, while lightweight models are
economical yet brittle on complex tasks. Static escalation rules and keyword
heuristics under-utilize this spectrum and fail to adapt across task types. We
present xRouter, a tool-calling-based routing system in which a learned router
can either answer directly or invoke one or more external models. The router is
trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning using an explicit, cost-aware
reward that encodes cost-performance trade-offs, eliminating the need for
hand-engineered routing rules. Our implementation encompasses the full
reinforcement learning framework, including reward and cost accounting, as well
as the deployment and evaluation pipelines. Across diverse benchmarks, xRouter
achieves strong cost-performance trade-offs (e.g., substantial cost reductions
at comparable task completion rates), and provides empirical insights into what
reliably helps learned routing and what does not, ranging from model
trainability to the difficulty of eliciting sophisticated orchestration
behaviors in small open models. We hope these findings and our open
implementation will serve as a practical substrate for advancing learned,
cost-aware LLM orchestration.

Motivation: To address challenges of training data scarcity and imbalance in time series foundation models by leveraging complex dynamic system theories to create unlimited high-quality synthetic data.

Method: Developed a series-symbol data generation mechanism that creates time series data paired with symbolic expressions, then pre-trained SymTime foundation model using these strongly correlated series-symbol pairs.

Result: SymTime demonstrates competitive performance across five major time series analysis tasks when fine-tuned, rivaling foundation models pre-trained on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The series-symbol data generation and pretraining approach shows strong potential for overcoming data scarcity issues and enhancing task performance in time series analysis.

Abstract: Foundation models for time series analysis (TSA) have attracted significant
attention. However, challenges such as training data scarcity and imbalance
continue to hinder their development. Inspired by complex dynamic system
theories, we design a series-symbol data generation mechanism, enabling the
unrestricted creation of high-quality time series data paired with
corresponding symbolic expressions. To leverage series-symbol data pairs with
strong correlations, we develop \texttt{SymTime}, a pre-trained foundation
model for enhancing time series representation using symbolic information.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper re-examines over-squashing in GNNs through the lens of storage/retrieval capacity, introduces a new synthetic task to demonstrate information bottlenecks, and develops a novel GNN architecture inspired by sequence modeling techniques that shows strong performance on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs suffer from over-squashing where information from large receptive fields collapses into fixed-size vectors, creating information bottlenecks. The authors aim to better understand this phenomenon through the concept of model storage and retrieval capacity.

Method: The authors study limitations of existing over-squashing measurement tasks, introduce a new synthetic capacity task, and adapt ideas from sequence modeling (associative memories, fast weight programmers, xLSTM) to develop a novel GNN architecture with improved capacity.

Result: The proposed architecture demonstrates strong performance on both the synthetic capacity task and a range of real-world graph benchmarks, showing improved handling of information bottlenecks.

Conclusion: By reframing over-squashing as a capacity limitation and drawing inspiration from sequence modeling techniques, the authors develop a GNN architecture that effectively addresses information bottlenecks and performs well across various tasks.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) leverage the graph structure to transmit
information between nodes, typically through the message-passing mechanism.
While these models have found a wide variety of applications, they are known to
suffer from over-squashing, where information from a large receptive field of
node representations is collapsed into a single fixed sized vector, resulting
in an information bottleneck. In this paper, we re-examine the over-squashing
phenomenon through the lens of model storage and retrieval capacity, which we
define as the amount of information that can be stored in a node's
representation for later use. We study some of the limitations of existing
tasks used to measure over-squashing and introduce a new synthetic task to
demonstrate that an information bottleneck can saturate this capacity.
Furthermore, we adapt ideas from the sequence modeling literature on
associative memories, fast weight programmers, and the xLSTM model to develop a
novel GNN architecture with improved capacity. We demonstrate strong
performance of this architecture both on our capacity synthetic task, as well
as a range of real-world graph benchmarks.

TL;DR: A rigorous framework for classifying activation functions using a nine-dimensional integral signature that combines Gaussian statistics, asymptotic slopes, and regularity measures, enabling principled analysis of neural network stability and expressivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing comparisons of activation functions are largely heuristic, lacking rigorous classification methods to guide principled design choices for neural network stability and performance.

Method: Proposed a nine-dimensional integral signature S_sigma(phi) combining Gaussian propagation statistics (m1, g1, g2, m2, eta), asymptotic slopes (alpha_plus, alpha_minus), and regularity measures (TV(phi'), C(phi)). Applied dynamical analysis with Lyapunov theorems and kernel perspective for dimension-free Hessian bounds.

Result: Classified eight standard activation functions (ReLU, leaky-ReLU, tanh, sigmoid, Swish, GELU, Mish, TeLU), proving sharp distinctions between saturating, linear-growth, and smooth families. Numerical validation confirmed theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: The framework moves activation function selection from trial-and-error to provable stability and kernel conditioning, providing principled design guidance for neural networks.

Abstract: Activation functions govern the expressivity and stability of neural
networks, yet existing comparisons remain largely heuristic. We propose a
rigorous framework for their classification via a nine-dimensional integral
signature S_sigma(phi), combining Gaussian propagation statistics (m1, g1, g2,
m2, eta), asymptotic slopes (alpha_plus, alpha_minus), and regularity measures
(TV(phi'), C(phi)). This taxonomy establishes well-posedness, affine
reparameterization laws with bias, and closure under bounded slope variation.
Dynamical analysis yields Lyapunov theorems with explicit descent constants and
identifies variance stability regions through (m2', g2). From a kernel
perspective, we derive dimension-free Hessian bounds and connect smoothness to
bounded variation of phi'. Applying the framework, we classify eight standard
activations (ReLU, leaky-ReLU, tanh, sigmoid, Swish, GELU, Mish, TeLU), proving
sharp distinctions between saturating, linear-growth, and smooth families.
Numerical Gauss-Hermite and Monte Carlo validation confirms theoretical
predictions. Our framework provides principled design guidance, moving
activation choice from trial-and-error to provable stability and kernel
conditioning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SummDiff frames video summarization as conditional generation using diffusion models to produce multiple plausible summaries that reflect human subjectivity, achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous video summarization methods deterministically regress to averaged frame scores, ignoring the inherent subjectivity of what constitutes a good summary according to different human perspectives.

Method: Proposes SummDiff, the first diffusion model for video summarization, which learns the distribution of good summaries and generates multiple candidate summaries conditioned on input videos through dynamic adaptation to visual contexts.

Result: Extensive experiments show SummDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks and produces summaries that closely align with individual annotator preferences. Novel knapsack-based metrics provide deeper evaluation insights.

Conclusion: Framing video summarization as conditional generation with diffusion models effectively captures the subjectivity of human preferences and generates multiple plausible summaries, advancing the field beyond deterministic approaches.

Abstract: Video summarization is a task of shortening a video by choosing a subset of
frames while preserving its essential moments. Despite the innate subjectivity
of the task, previous works have deterministically regressed to an averaged
frame score over multiple raters, ignoring the inherent subjectivity of what
constitutes a good summary. We propose a novel problem formulation by framing
video summarization as a conditional generation task, allowing a model to learn
the distribution of good summaries and to generate multiple plausible summaries
that better reflect varying human perspectives. Adopting diffusion models for
the first time in video summarization, our proposed method, SummDiff,
dynamically adapts to visual contexts and generates multiple candidate
summaries conditioned on the input video. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SummDiff not only achieves the state-of-the-art performance on various
benchmarks but also produces summaries that closely align with individual
annotator preferences. Moreover, we provide a deeper insight with novel metrics
from an analysis of the knapsack, which is an important last step of generating
summaries but has been overlooked in evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional clustering algorithms are limited by predefined similarity measures and cannot handle complex relationships or text-conditioned clustering tasks that LLMs can address through their flexible attention mechanisms.

Method: Uses pretrained LLMs with attention matrices for zero-shot clustering, applies spectral clustering on attention matrices, fine-tunes LLMs using Next Token Prediction loss for enhanced clustering on numeric and image data, and leverages prompting for text-conditioned image clustering.

Result: LLMs demonstrate impressive zero-shot clustering capabilities, attention matrices reveal clear cluster patterns, spectral clustering with attention matrices achieves competitive performance, and fine-tuning further improves clustering on various data types including text-conditioned image clustering.

Conclusion: ICC successfully extends in-context learning to unsupervised settings, showcasing LLMs' effectiveness and flexibility for clustering tasks across diverse data distributions and enabling capabilities beyond traditional clustering methods.

Abstract: We propose In-Context Clustering (ICC), a flexible LLM-based procedure for
clustering data from diverse distributions. Unlike traditional clustering
algorithms constrained by predefined similarity measures, ICC flexibly captures
complex relationships among inputs through an attention mechanism. We show that
pretrained LLMs exhibit impressive zero-shot clustering capabilities on
text-encoded numeric data, with attention matrices showing salient cluster
patterns. Spectral clustering using attention matrices offers surprisingly
competitive performance. We further enhance the clustering capabilities of LLMs
on numeric and image data through fine-tuning using the Next Token Prediction
(NTP) loss. Moreover, the flexibility of LLM prompting enables text-conditioned
image clustering, a capability that classical clustering methods lack. Our work
extends in-context learning to an unsupervised setting, showcasing the
effectiveness and flexibility of LLMs for clustering. Our code is available at

*Sharut Gupta,Shobhita Sundaram,Chenyu Wang,Stefanie Jegelka,Phillip Isola*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UML introduces a modality-agnostic training paradigm that leverages unpaired multimodal data to enhance representation learning in target modalities without requiring paired datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multimodal learning relies heavily on paired datasets, but there's potential to leverage abundant unpaired multimodal data to enhance representation learning in target modalities.

Method: UML uses a single model that alternately processes inputs from different modalities while sharing parameters across them, exploiting the assumption that different modalities are projections of a shared underlying reality.

Result: Theoretically, unpaired auxiliary data yields more informative representations than unimodal training. Empirically, using unpaired data from auxiliary modalities consistently improves downstream performance across diverse unimodal targets like image and audio.

Conclusion: UML demonstrates that unpaired multimodal data can effectively enhance representation learning without requiring explicit paired datasets, offering a practical alternative to traditional multimodal approaches.

Abstract: Traditional multimodal learners find unified representations for tasks like
visual question answering, but rely heavily on paired datasets. However, an
overlooked yet potentially powerful question is: can one leverage auxiliary
unpaired multimodal data to directly enhance representation learning in a
target modality? We introduce UML: Unpaired Multimodal Learner, a
modality-agnostic training paradigm in which a single model alternately
processes inputs from different modalities while sharing parameters across
them. This design exploits the assumption that different modalities are
projections of a shared underlying reality, allowing the model to benefit from
cross-modal structure without requiring explicit pairs. Theoretically, under
linear data-generating assumptions, we show that unpaired auxiliary data can
yield representations strictly more informative about the data-generating
process than unimodal training. Empirically, we show that using unpaired data
from auxiliary modalities -- such as text, audio, or images -- consistently
improves downstream performance across diverse unimodal targets such as image

Result: Achieves up to 6.3% improvement in final model accuracy and 46% reduction in total training time across diverse workloads, hardware configurations, and network conditions. Scales well to 32 nodes and learned policies generalize across related model architectures.

Conclusion: DYNAMIX provides an effective reinforcement learning-based solution for dynamic batch size optimization that integrates seamlessly with existing distributed training frameworks and eliminates the need for explicit system modeling.

Abstract: Existing batch size selection approaches in dis- tributed machine learning
rely on static allocation or simplistic heuristics that fail to adapt to
heterogeneous, dynamic computing environments. We present DYNAMIX, a
reinforcement learning framework that formulates batch size optimization as a
sequen- tial decision-making problem using Proximal Policy Optimiza- tion
(PPO). Our approach employs a multi-dimensional state representation
encompassing network-level metrics, system-level resource utilization, and
training statistical efficiency indicators to enable informed decision-making
across diverse computational resources. Our approach eliminates the need for
explicit system modeling while integrating seamlessly with existing distributed
training frameworks. Through evaluations across diverse work- loads, hardware
configurations, and network conditions, DY- NAMIX achieves up to 6.3%
improvement in the final model accuracy and 46% reduction in the total training
time. Our scalability experiments demonstrate that DYNAMIX maintains the best
performance as cluster size increases to 32 nodes, while policy transfer
experiments show that learned policies generalize effectively across related
model architectures.

TL;DR: A theoretical framework for policy optimization that guarantees convergence to a specific optimal policy through vanishing entropy regularization and temperature decoupling, producing interpretable, diversity-preserving policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL methods ignore policy properties beyond expected return, making it difficult to characterize learned policies and their behaviors.

Method: Uses vanishing entropy regularization and temperature decoupling to ensure convergence to interpretable optimal policies that preserve diversity.

Result: The framework guarantees convergence to particular optimal policies, with one instance sampling all optimal actions uniformly, and enables accurate estimation of return distributions.

Conclusion: The approach provides theoretical guarantees for interpretable, diversity-preserving policy optimization with convergence of value functions and return distributions.

Abstract: In the pursuit of finding an optimal policy, reinforcement learning (RL)
methods generally ignore the properties of learned policies apart from their
expected return. Thus, even when successful, it is difficult to characterize
which policies will be learned and what they will do. In this work, we present
a theoretical framework for policy optimization that guarantees convergence to
a particular optimal policy, via vanishing entropy regularization and a
temperature decoupling gambit. Our approach realizes an interpretable,
diversity-preserving optimal policy as the regularization temperature vanishes
and ensures the convergence of policy derived objects--value functions and
return distributions. In a particular instance of our method, for example, the
realized policy samples all optimal actions uniformly. Leveraging our
temperature decoupling gambit, we present an algorithm that estimates, to
arbitrary accuracy, the return distribution associated to its interpretable,
diversity-preserving optimal policy.

TL;DR: GDPO is a new RL algorithm for diffusion language models that reduces variance in ELBO estimation through semi-deterministic Monte Carlo schemes, outperforming existing methods on math, reasoning, and coding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting RL fine-tuning to diffusion language models is challenging due to intractable likelihoods. Existing methods like diffu-GRPO are biased, while ELBO-based approaches are computationally expensive.

Method: GDPO uses semi-deterministic Monte Carlo schemes to reduce variance in ELBO estimation by employing fast, deterministic integral approximations along key dimensions, avoiding the variance explosion of vanilla double Monte Carlo sampling.

Result: GDPO achieves consistent improvements over pretrained checkpoints and outperforms diffu-GRPO on most math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks.

Conclusion: GDPO provides an effective RL fine-tuning approach for diffusion language models by addressing the variance issues in ELBO estimation, demonstrating superior performance across multiple domains.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) enable parallel, order-agnostic generation
with iterative refinement, offering a flexible alternative to autoregressive
large language models (LLMs). However, adapting reinforcement learning (RL)
fine-tuning to DLMs remains an open challenge because of the intractable
likelihood. Pioneering work such as diffu-GRPO estimated token-level
likelihoods via one-step unmasking. While computationally efficient, this
approach is severely biased. A more principled foundation lies in
sequence-level likelihoods, where the evidence lower bound (ELBO) serves as a
surrogate. Yet, despite this clean mathematical connection, ELBO-based methods
have seen limited adoption due to the prohibitive cost of likelihood
evaluation. In this work, we revisit ELBO estimation and disentangle its
sources of variance. This decomposition motivates reducing variance through
fast, deterministic integral approximations along a few pivotal dimensions.
Building on this insight, we introduce \textbf{Group Diffusion Policy
Optimization (GDPO)}, a new RL algorithm tailored for DLMs. GDPO leverages
simple yet effective Semi-deterministic Monte Carlo schemes to mitigate the
variance explosion of ELBO estimators under vanilla double Monte Carlo
sampling, yielding a provably lower-variance estimator under tight evaluation
budgets. Empirically, GDPO achieves consistent gains over pretrained
checkpoints and outperforms diffu-GRPO, one of the state-of-the-art baselines,
on the majority of math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Linearizer architecture that makes nonlinear neural networks linear by sandwiching a linear operator between two invertible neural networks, enabling application of linear algebra tools to nonlinear mappings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between nonlinear neural networks and linear algebra tools by identifying vector spaces where conventionally nonlinear functions become linear, making powerful linear methods applicable to neural networks.

Method: Sandwich a linear operator A between two invertible neural networks: f(x)=g_y^{-1}(A g_x(x)), creating vector spaces with operations derived from g_x and g_y. This Linearizer architecture enables linear algebra operations on nonlinear mappings.

Result: The method enables application of SVD, pseudo-inverse, orthogonal projection to nonlinear mappings. Composition of Linearizers allows collapsing hundreds of diffusion sampling steps into one, enforces idempotency for projective generative models, and enables modular style transfer.

Conclusion: The Linearizer framework successfully makes nonlinear neural networks linear in constructed vector spaces, enabling powerful linear algebra tools to be applied to neural networks with practical applications in diffusion models, generative modeling, and style transfer.

Abstract: Neural networks are famously nonlinear. However, linearity is defined
relative to a pair of vector spaces, $f$$:$$X$$\to$$Y$. Is it possible to
identify a pair of non-standard vector spaces for which a conventionally
nonlinear function is, in fact, linear? This paper introduces a method that
makes such vector spaces explicit by construction. We find that if we sandwich
a linear operator $A$ between two invertible neural networks, $f(x)=g_y^{-1}(A
g_x(x))$, then the corresponding vector spaces $X$ and $Y$ are induced by newly
defined addition and scaling actions derived from $g_x$ and $g_y$. We term this
kind of architecture a Linearizer. This framework makes the entire arsenal of
linear algebra, including SVD, pseudo-inverse, orthogonal projection and more,
applicable to nonlinear mappings. Furthermore, we show that the composition of
two Linearizers that share a neural network is also a Linearizer. We leverage
this property and demonstrate that training diffusion models using our
architecture makes the hundreds of sampling steps collapse into a single step.
We further utilize our framework to enforce idempotency (i.e. $f(f(x))=f(x)$)
on networks leading to a globally projective generative model and to
demonstrate modular style transfer.
